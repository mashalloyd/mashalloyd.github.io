<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Hi everyone,</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Well here we are in Santa Pola where we have come for a few days to enjoy the beach in between responsibilities and other stuff at home. Funnily enough you will read later that we have a very illustrious neighbour in these parts as this is where Mariano Rajoy, the outed Spanish Prime Minister, has returned to his job as a well paid property registrar believe it or not. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><o:p>A year ago on Sunday it was my 60th birthday party and I well remember just how hot it was then, over 40ºc .Well on Sunday last it reached 32º and that has been the tonic ever since and temperatures are going to rise next week even more. Thankfully, here at our apartment it's slightly cooler. </o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><o:p>It was on Sunday last that the Aquarius migrant ship with 2 others, arrived at the port of Valencia carrying over 600 refugees from Africa mostly; many of whom were unaccompanied minors.  These were the people the new far right wing Italian government refused to let disembark in Italy. They will only admit migrants rescued at sea by the Italian sea guard, not international ONGs as was the case of the Aquarius. </o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><o:p>The Aquarius migrants who will be well looked after in Spain and in France, and who had a huge welcome reception are just the tip of the iceberg though. Now that Spain has taken them in, there are literally thousands and thousands waiting on the shores of Libya or near Melilla and boats all over the Mediterranean sea about to come. The EU is not sure what to do and it's no easy question. I read of a proposal for a big  camp for them all somewhere in Africa where they could be held in decent conditions until they are sorted as legitimate or  non legitimate refugees, i.e they are escaping violence or war or are coming to earn more money. Frankly I feel for both types. I mean all those who populated the USA at the beginning of the last century were mostly people looking for a better life. The real solution lies in helping them economically in their countries of origin but I'm afraid I tend to agree with Jesus Christ who  said "the poor will always be with you". So yes, there was a huge reception for the Aquarius migrants but the problem has not gone away. </o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><o:p>Oli's boyfriend who is a TV cameraman and works in Valencia, paid us a surprise visit that morning with 5 of his colleagues who had been on a caravan holiday in Galicia. All of the them would be involved in covering the news of the Aquarius migrants upon their return to work in Valencia on Monday. I told Miguel how lucky he was to be part of what I considered "world wise news". </o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><o:p><br></br></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><o:p>I had quite a lazy Sunday, enjoying having the house and pool to ourselves with no Airbnb guests. The hen party girls left that morning without saying goodbye which was a bit rude, especially when they had come with 3 more friends and had a party when my 2 major house rules are: no extra guests and no parties. I think they were first time Airbnb guests and thankfully are the exception to the generally really nicely behaved people who come. </o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><o:p><br></br></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><o:p>Having finished Bill Clinton's book The President is Missing which I can highly recommend  if you like suspense, I turned to a completely different genre; North Korean defector biographies of which I have read many. "<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dear-Leader-propagandist-exposes-shocking/dp/1846044219">Dear Leader</a>" is not just another escape story because of the status of Jan Jin-sung who worked in intelligence and even once met Kim Jong Il, the current dictator's frightening father. He is probably the defector with the most inside information  of how this hermetic country is run, ever to have made it to South Korea. His story is astonishing to say the least. </o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><o:p><br></br></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><o:p>In between reading I bathed as it was so hot. In fact last Sunday was my first bathe of the year. It was Oli's too when she came back from a barbecue with friends. </o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><o:p><br></br></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><o:p>Meanwhile, in Russia, the world cup was underway with some countries making their debut. There have been some shocks since it started with a lot of the big teams struggling. Mexico stunned the German champions by winning 1.0 and Brazil drew with little Switzerland, another shocker. </o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><o:p><br></br></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><o:p>But the good sports news for Spain on Sunday didn't come from Russia but from France. Fernando Alonso, the Formula 1 driver <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/motorsport/44510955">won the Le Mans 24 hours </a>"endurance test". That was quite big although I would prefer him to perform better in F1. He won it twice a few years ago but has not done well since. He was pleased though as you can see in the photo below. </o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I read later that it is one of the most prestigious car races in the world and has been called the "Grand Prix of Endurance and efficiency". It is part of the Triple Crown of Motorsport, two of which Alonso has now won, Le Mans and the Monaco Grand Prix. He now aims to try his luck with the Indianapolis 500. If he wins all three I think he will be the first Spaniard ever to do so.  </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">After time by the pool it was time for dinner, our last with Olivia for a while as she would be off to the west coast of Florida on Tuesday and not back until the end of next week. She is 6 hours behind us and Suzy in Bali is 6 hours ahead of us. It's funny to have both girls at different ends of the globe so to speak. They, by the way, speak at midnight Florida time which is the only time they can I think. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We had a delicious dinner of my home made gazpacho and the remains of the potato salad and cherry syllabub. Then she was off and the house was empty again. But not for long. That evening I got another reservation from Airbnb; an Italian family coming in September. I have a German family staying now and there will hardly be any free days without guests from now until September.  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We put the air conditioning on for the first time last Sunday. It was not a good night's sleep for me as, naughty naughty me had indulged in chocolate and wine at dinner,  a combination guaranteed to give me one. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Monday came. Now that the days are so hot, we decided to go on our walks early in the morning. I came back to bathe in the pool and even shower there. That's a great way to start my day. Oli's day was deliciously different on Monday. She had been asked to take part in a real time online interview with spectators of her programme, "Madrileños por el Mundo" about the latest one on Croatia which would be broadcast on Tuesday evening. As it was live, I followed it and even sent in a question; mine was the first haha, just in case there weren't many. Miguel sent one in too but we shouldn't have worried as there were plenty. This is the photo they took of her answering the questions. I told her it was a great photo and she typically replied "but I haven't got any makeup on" hahah. Well, I like it. Judge for yourselves.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Here is the <a href="http://encuentros.telemadrid.es/olivia-en-croacia/">link</a> to the interview if you are interested. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">On Monday I was busy with lots of little errands and was surprised to get yet another Airbn reservation for a few days free in the calendar next week. A French couple are coming to find accommodation for their son who will be studying dentistry at the University nearby. We get a lot of French people and they are always great guests. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Oli wasn't the only one in my world to have an interview that day. Spain's new Prime Minister, the dashing socialist Pedro Sánchez, was to give his first TV interview that night on TVE. We watched it with baited breath as after the whirlwind of the vote of no confidence and his becoming Prime Minister he has given out many good signs. The most important thing he did was to appoint a majority of women in his cabinet. I have read in the international press that he is following a similar strategy to Canada's Trudeau. During the no  confidence vote session he had promised to call elections. However, in the interview, he revealed it is his intention to stay in power until the next general elections in 2020. So he lied, yes he did. So he likes being Prime Minister, yes of course. But let's give him a chance and see whether the economy continues to thrive and just how much he will have to concede to the Catalan separatists. He is doing everything differently which might not be a bad thing at all. The first international visit for a new Prime Minister in Spain is traditionally to it's neighbour Morocco. But Sánchez' first visit was to the Elysee to see Macron who gave him his support over the Aquarius. It will be good to hear him speak English to the French President and others as Sanchez is the first Spanish Prime Minister who speaks the language and that is in his favour when it comes to international politics. He may be all sorts of other things but for me he is a breath of fresh air. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Tuesday came, another hot day. While we were going about our day, Oli was flying to Tampa. It was to be her first time in the USA and I warned her about the strict security. It would take her all day to get there, flying via Atlanta. She left at 11 am Spanish time and got to Tampa at 1.30 in the morning, our time the next day. The poor girl was exhausted. She complained later at how difficult it was to eat healthy food for breakfast at her hotel, The Hilotn and that it was surrounded by burger joints! That didn't surprise me. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">As usual I was up early in the morning at about 6 am. I am avidly following the World Cup group standings although we only watch the Spanish matches. So I was happy to see that England had beat Tunisia but with a last minute goal. This World cup is certainly proving difficult for the top teams. That win should spur on England fans though to travel to Russia to see the next matches. I read that not many had gone after the tensions of the Salisbury poison attacks. I have also read that the Russian bars are quickly running out of beer as they hadn't factored in just how popular it is with football fans. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">After our morning walk, I had to work and then make  lunch. It was "fabada" (bean stew) that day. I also had time to change the flowers in the house for our next guests. I love our summer flowers, mostly roses and hydrangeas. It was on our walk we noticed Elsa had a problem with her ear, she kept scratching it. In the afternoon, it was obvious she was in pain so we quickly took her to the vet. To look properly they had to sedate her and then operate as it turned out she had yeast infection which caused otitis and must be very painful. We went back for poor confused Elsa later in the evening. She is now on antibiotics and I hope the infection clears up and doesn't come back. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We had dinner on the terrace and as it was late we watched the news on my iPad. The most interesting news for me that day was about Mariano Rajoy. I mentioned at the beginning of this post that he is <a href="https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/06/20/inenglish/1529481327_420960.html%20(">returning to  his job in Santa Pola</a>, of all places, as a property registrar. He actually started on Wednesday. It was where he worked in the late 80's and is a well paid civil servant job in Spain (between 10 and 20.000 euros a month). I was quite amazed to hear he had rejected his right to a 80.000 euro per year stipend as an ex Prime Minister as well as one for 100.000 as part of the Executive Council.  He has also given up his status as an MP, thus completely severing ties with politics. He does though still have a bodyguard and chauffeur car. t seems funny that he is going back to an "ordinary" job and does not want any of the monetary trappings an ex Premiere is entitled to. At least this is what I have read. I do know for sure that he is now working here. This also means our flat comes under his jurisdiction. We might even meet him at his and our favourite restaurant in Santa Pola, "Batiste" where he has been seen recently. He will be living here too but I wonder where. I must say that his attitude is praiseworthy. He is actually living at the best hotel in Alicante, the Melia where he will probably stay until about October when he can opt for a transfer to Madrid with his job. He is apparently watching as many of the World Cup matches he can from there as he is an avid football fan. How many ex Presidents do we know of who have gone back to their previous jobs I wonder? None probably. If I ever meet him here I shall congratulate him on his decision. Meanwhile there is one big political battle in his right wing party (PP) to see who will succeed his leadership. By the way he was late for work on Wednesday as he had to attend to a huge group of journalists waiting for him to arrive.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">At the beginning of July I am going to France (near Poitiers) for our annual cousin reunion, from my Mother's Russian side of the family. I had bought a return ticket a while ago via Expedia and would be flying with Air France to Charles de Gaulle where I need to land in order to catch the TGV to Poitiers. Well, it turned out I bought the ticket on Expedia's US site which gave me endless problems. It was on Thursday when buying my TGV ticket I realised my outbound flight was at 8.15 in the evening, too late to catch the last train. I had meant to buy the ticket for the plane leaving at 8.15 in the morning but due to the US way of showing the times of day, I made a mistake and bought a seat on the evening flight. Sadly, I had to buy another ticket and had to so on the Expedia US site again, hoping for a refund as I had bought a protected ticket. But no, I ended up buying a new ticket, this time with Vueling. I then bought my TGV ticket and in the end spent a small fortune on the whole trip. I shall never again buy a ticket on Expedia. Rather I shall do so direct with the airline. What a nightmare. Happily though, just afterwards I got another Airbnb booking, the income of which should cover part of the extra cost of my trip to France hahaha. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Thursday saw Spain from </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> group B (Portugal, Spain, Iran and Morocco) play its second match and it was against Iran at 8 pm that night. In the first match Spain and Portugal drew so both had 1 point each. Just before the Spain match, Portugal played and beat Morocco but only by 1-0, thus they led the group by 4 points. That made it crucial for Spain to beat Iran and preferably with 2 goals. We had dinner watching the match which was so tense and so close mostly because the Iranian side did nothing but defend; they were like a brick wall. Finally the breakthrough came in the second half when Diego Costa scored a goal. The Iranians looked to have scored an equaliser not long afterwards but </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> the VAR, showed it was offside. That was a huge relief for Spain who now have 4 points like Portugal after </span><a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20180620-world-cup-spain-beat-iran-1-0-close-world-cup-last-16-group-b" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">beating Iran 1-0</a><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">.

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">If anyone thinks beating Iran was a knockout they are completely wrong. This valiant team, managed by Queiroz, who was once a Real Madrid manager, came to the competition unbeaten throughout the qualifying stage and were not to be taken lightly. The big news of the match though had nothing to do with football but to do with Iranian women. In Iran women are not allowed to go to football matches and here they were to be seen in western style dress and non veiled faces, many of them with the Iranian flag painted on their faces. That was a lovely sight. I wonder what the ayatollahs thought about that back home?</span></div>

The next day, The First Lady, Melania Trump, who has been trying to persuade her stubborn husband to revoke the law, visited some of the children. She wore a very unfortunate jacket for the occasion, with the words "I really </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">don't care, do you?" on the back of it, a green Zara jacket.

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The appointment I was waiting for was important as </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> my left eye did not respond well to the intraocular lens he put in as I still had astimagatism. He had told me to wear prescription glasses for 3 weeks and when he did more tests that morning, he advised laser surgery on my left eye. According to him it will correct some of the astigmatism but not all. To sum it up I will see without glasses as well as I do now with those he prescribed which is not great I can tell you. There is nothing organically wrong with my eyes and when I asked, my doctor told me my case was the first he had ever seen and was difficult to explain. The laser surgery will be done on 16th July so cross your fingers my friends that it will be successful and that I will be able to see better than I do now and that I won't need glasses. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I rushed home after my appointment to finish packing and also load lots of food into the car as I hate having to do food shopping when we get here. We left at around midday with quite a lot of traffic it being a Friday. It was also the San Juan midsummer feast in Alicante and all over Spain so there was even more traffic than usual. We stopped for lunch at a restaurant bar in Zarza de Záncara we like which was full too. The waiter took ages to bring the bill and all in all our stop there was 1.5h. That meant we didn't get to our flat in Gran Alacant, some 7km from Santa Pola until the early evening. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I was dying to go down to the beach but first we had to clean a bit and settle in. Eladio would have preferred to read on the terrace afterwards as he was tired from driving.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">However, in need of a walk, I persuaded him to go to the beach. We had to leave Pippa in the flat as, sadly, dogs are not really allowed on beaches in Spain, at least in the summer. It was to be the first bathe in the sea this summer and we both enjoyed it. We can never go in together as one of us always has to look after the valuables: my phone, our kindles and the car keys. Here is Eladio coming out of the sea after his first bathe. The water was quite warm and very calm and we </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">both enjoyed it immensely.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We then went for our customary walk to the end where the rocks are and from where we can see our apartment and of course the island of Tabarca. We came home late at around 9 pm. I went to the pool to wash off the sea water and sand and had it practically to myself. Dinner was a small affair, scrambled eggs on toast after which we watched a film about the Roman invasion of Britannia until we fell asleep. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Yesterday Saturday 23rd June was San Juan a feast celebrated all over Spain and especially in the Alicante area where St. John is the patron saint. People light bonfires at night </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> on the beaches all over Spain and here too of course and have barbecues with their families and friends. I'm sure the experience is lovely but the many </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> signs of no parking after 5pm put us off going to </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> what we would imagine to be large crowds, something we both hate. We decided, instead, to go the beach from 10 to 12 in the morning </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">after which it would get very hot and crowded. Again we left Pippa behind and we were a bit worried about her as she had had bouts of diarrhea since we left Madrid. I looked up veterinary surgeries close by just in case and found one at a nearby shopping centre which was open until 10 pm or so we thought.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We took our kindles, bathed, read and went for our usual walk. By 12 we were home and chillaxing, to quote my daughter Suzy hahahah. By the late afternoon Pippa was vomiting so we whisked her into the car and took her to the surgery I had found on internet only to see it was closed due to the San Juan holiday. It was to be the same with all the others. I searched on the internet desperately until </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">until I found one in Elche, a big town about 15km from here. Despite our GPS we always get lost in Elche,  a town made rich by shoe manufacturing, but luckily, this time we didn't. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">A nice young vet called Veronica analysed the sample I had taken, took Pippa's temperature and also took 2 x-rays. It seems there was no bacteria lurking although she could be incubating something. </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> It was the x-ray which worried Veronica because she thought she saw the shadow of some sort of obstruction "foreign matter" in her intestine. She gave Pippa a couple of injections to relieve the symptoms but we have to go back today to repeat the x-ray and most probably do a scan. If there is something obstructing her;  possibly </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">something she ate on one of our walks, she will have to be operated on. Please cross your fingers that won't be the problem and that it is just gastroenteritis.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We were back late to the apartment but happy to have found a vet for Pippa. Luckily she has no temperature and apparently no pain. We could see the bonfires on the beach below our flat which was a  pretty sight but difficult to capture on camera. We had a very simple dinner and then watched half of a soppy film on TV. We had missed the news but I was up to date with the World Cup group standings. Germany had beaten Sweden and amazingly Switzerland beat Serbia. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Meanwhile, in Florida, Oli continued her work filming there if you can call it work hahaha. She sent us a photo last night together </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">with a group of girls scantily dressed. I asked her who they were and she replied "Hooter Girls", as if I knew what that is. She then told me they are waiters of the famous chain of Hooter restaurants which i had never heard of. I have now hahaha. You can read more about them </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooters" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">here</a><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The photo was taken at the <a href="http://www.originalhooters.com/locations/tampa-bay/clearwater-beach/">Hooters restaurant</a> on Clearwater beach. Oli had told me it is ranked one of the </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> best beaches </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">in the USA.
