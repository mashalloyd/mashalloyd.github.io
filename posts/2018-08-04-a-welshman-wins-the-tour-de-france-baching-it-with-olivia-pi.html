<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Hello again everyone,</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">It's now August and we are in the middle of a sweltering heatwave here. It has reached 42ºc here this week which is just too much for me.  It's hot all over Europe including the north of Europe. Imagine Germany with 35º c. If that isn't thanks to global warming then give me another explanation. It's literally sizzling and the only place to escape is to our air conditioned bedroom with the ceiling fan on too and all at high speed. Eladio is back too, finally but last Sunday I was alone until Oli joined me in the evening.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">That morning I took Pippa on our walk, feeling bad about leaving the others behind. On our way we bumped into a dog friend of hers, perhaps the only one apart from Elsa and Norah. She usually barks at other dogs except for this one. Here they are together. Notice just how dry everything is in the background. And it's going to get dryer if this weather continues and in the not too distant future, if global warming is not stopped, Spain will be just one big desert. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Once home and showered, I spent some quality time with my lovely English family. In fact I gave a Spanish lesson to Brent and to Brody, the 7 year old boy who stole my heart last year. He is so talented and fun to be with. They then went out to have "churros" for breakfast or rather "porras" (the thicker, longer version) while I prepared lunch, simple spaghetti bolognese for my Father and I only. Lucy's sister, Gloria, would be visiting her and had brought some Paraguayan food. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I spent the afternoon alone with the dogs, reading in the garden. Before the heatwave, the weather was lovely with temperatures in the low 30's. I finished James Rhodes' book, Instrumental and by then it was time to prepare dinner for Oli and myself. She had come back from Galicia in the north west of Spain (Rias Altas) and first had to drop off Miguel at the station for him to return to Valencia where he works. It was a delight to see her again and finally to have some company as I must say I was feeling a little lonely. She made my day. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Meanwhile my English family were out to dinner. They went to El Kiosko, my latest favourite and sent me a photo. Here they are together, all  7 of them. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">They have enjoyed their stay here enormously, hardly venturing out. At the beginning, little Brody was made to keep English hours, i.e. going to bed early. After a couple of days though, he was into Spanish children's habits, taking a siesta in the afternoon and staying up late. I think he liked that. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I'm not sure they were too aware that a British cyclist had been proclaimed the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cycling/44998961">winner of this year's Tour de France</a> that day in the Champs-Élysées. I should correct myself and say the Welsh cyclist, Geraint Thomas from the Sky team. He has become the third Briton to win the Tour after Bradley Wiggins in 2012 and his team mate the four time Tour champion Chris Froome. Froome was supposed to be the team's big star and set to win but it didn't work out that way and now anyone interested in cycling knows that a Welshman called Geraint Thomas has won it. It's amazing how British cyclists have been dominating the French race since 2012 (6 wins in the last 7 years!).  He is 32 years old and  winning this year is an amazing feat. I later read he went to the same school as Gareth Bale in Cardiff. Well done Wales, well done Great Britain. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Oli and I had a long and late dinner and later called Eladio. We then went to bed with little Pippa and watched a film on Netflix. It can't have been very good as I don't remember what it was called.  </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Monday is my most newsy day as Oli and I packed in a lot together that day. Once again, we laughingly said we were "baching it" and agreed that we could do anything we wanted.There was no one to stop us hahaha. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">The day started with an early walk with all three dogs thanks to Oli being here. I was pleased to see an email when I got back from my clipping agency, JP Media. I had garnered nearly 50 articles in the media from Friday's Adamo press release. I could hardly believe it; much was thanks to the Spanish news agency Efe (thank you). </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Waiting for us at home after our walk were our 2 Emma Bridgewater orders. It was my umpteenth and Oli's first. Both orders were for items in the sales. Here is Oli with hers.</span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Oli and I had plenty of errands to do that day. After getting some cash out of the "hole in the wall" in nearby Boadilla (Sector B), we had a coffee and a mini croissant at our favourite café (Alverán). That was when I commented how lucky we were to be having a coffee together there on  a Monday morning when most people were working. Here we are together. </span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Our next stop was the fruit and vegetable market in Villaviciosa de Odón recommended to me by my friend Fátima which only opens on a Monday. It's a tiny little one with just 3 stalls of fruit and two or three of clothes. We looked at the clothes but did not buy anything. We got some fruit and it was pretty good so no doubt I shall be going again. Here I am with my bag of fruit at the market.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">From the market we drove back to Boadilla, this time to the petrol station to clean Oli's car in the automatic car washer there. That's a job I never like. We would have to clean mine in the afternoon as it was filthy. Just next to the petrol station is a small shopping centre and we went to the </span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"> shoe repairer shop to get a new battery for my gate keys. Once there Oli and I spied a new dress shop and in we went. My youngest daughter bought a pair of trousers and a strawberry coloured jump suit. I bought a yellow summer dress.  We were baching it and we didn't care hahaha. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Before going home for lunch we had one last errand to do. We had to go and see Celes, the mother of the girls' great friend Copi. </span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">She was to give Oli a bag of clothes for her daughter who lives in Vitoria and who Oli was going to spend a few days with this week.  I hadn't seen Celes since the girls were still at school and well remember her as they would spend days at Copi's house and vice versa. It was great to see her and we just had to have a selfie.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">We were home on time for lunch with my Father and Oli pushed his wheel chair up the path. When we had finished, I suggested we pick the last of the green plums from the tree in the kitchen garden patio. Believe it or not, Lucy, whose back is obviously better, climbed up the tree barefoot and did a marvelous job. This was the last of the plum harvest for this year. I think all in all we got about 3 or 4 kilos of the delicious fruit.</span></div>

It had a lot of sticky nasty stuff on the roof from the trees. Thus we had to shampoo and power wash it before putting it through the car washer. Oh my, did we get wet and oh how we laughed. And then on the spur of the moment we decided to go out to dinner, on a Monday night, together. We both decided on an old favourite, La Vaca Argentina in Las Rozas. We were gutted to find it closed down when we got there. I suggested De María which is also Argentinian in Majdadahonda as an alternative and that's where we went. I must say our meal was fantastic. I love the terrace there and all the extra bits and pieces of food you get served supposedly for free although I'm sure they go in the bill somehow. Here we are enjoying our bachelor dinner on Monday night and eating delicious food.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">I didn't just eat, I drank too which is unusual for me as alcohol nearly always gives me a headache. I drank the "free" pink cava we were given when we arrived, I drank a large glass of Rioja with our meal and then had a small glass of something which looked and tasted like Bayleys at the end when we were offered free liqueurs. And guess what? I did not get a headache the next day or that night. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I had dinner on my own, if you can call it dinner: stoned cherries with yoghurt. That night I watched (in English) a very interesting documentary on Netflix called "One of Us". It tells the tale of the lives of Hasidic Jews in New York who decide to leave the community and how difficult it is for them, especially the women. This ultra orthodox Jewish community, live and dress like their forefathers did in the 18th century. Women are considered mere baby machines. Communities like them fascinate me. It's amazing to see how they isolate themselves and shun anything "modern", especially the internet. Children born into these communities are not offered a choice. </span></div>

He had been away for 10 days in Montrondo looking after his Mother. I think it was perhaps the longest time we have ever been apart and both of us felt strange being alone.

The temperature was to rise to 39ºc that day, pretty high I can tell you.  He was back just on time for lunch; baked hake and vegetables, a healthy option which is quick and easy to make. After a siesta in our room with the air con on, we spent time reading under the trees but it was too hot. Our English family were sweltering by the pool and I'm sure it was too hot for them too. The girls asked for a photo of Eladio home again and I obliged. Here he is with Pippa who was as pleased to see him again as I was.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Just after 6 pm, that evening I had another doctor's appointment. It was to see the results of the back and hip MRI I did a few weeks back. I was diagnosed with </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Spondylolisthesis over ten years ago and at the beginning of the year had quite a lot of back pain. If you are interested this is a description of the condition: <i>"</i></span><span class="ilfuvd"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><i> is a slipping of vertebra that occurs, in most cases, at the base of the spine. Spondylolysis, which is a defect or fracture of one or both wing-shaped parts of a vertebra, can result in vertebrae slipping backward, forward, or over a bone below"</i>.  To cut a long story short, apparently the two vertebra affected had fused some years ago and on Wednesday the trauma specialist confirmed they were fused by 75%. She said that 75% fusion would be the aim of surgery which I won't need thanks to the natural healing process that occurred.  She commented that mother nature was amazing and I quite agree. It will give me sporadic pain over the years but I can put up with that. As to the hip; well it has wear and tear and a bit of arthritis but thankfully no need for a hip replacement which I was worried I might need with all that that would entail. I know now that it was caused when I fell and fractured a vertebra at the age of about 11. I was climbing up the ladder of a diving board at the Shipley baths and slipped and fell on my back from quite a height. I think it was the only time I have ever been in an ambulance. My brother George was with me (aged 13) and he was most excited about being in an ambulance. The X-ray showed a fractured vertebra and I remember the doctor telling my Mother I would have to keep very thin and do ballet, neither of which I ever did. He also said that by 40 I would probably be in a wheel chair. Thankfully he was wrong and mother nature was on my side. </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I came home feeling quite good with the results and by the time I was back it was time for dinner. Oh what to make? Well I made one of our usual dishes, tuna fish salad which we both enjoy. Who wants hot food on a hot night. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It was great to get my official bed partner back on Wednesday night. </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Who was a little bit sad that night was Brody, our 7 year old Airbnb guest from Northamptonshire. He said to  his Mother, Luella,  <i>"sadly, we only have two days left. I'd stay here forever. </i></span><i><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Meeting Masha and Eladio and and having a</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span></i><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><i>pool are the best parts</i>". I was so flattered. </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">He stole my heart last year and he stole it again this year. He is so bright and fun to be with. I told him I liked his personality. I then asked him if he knew what that meant and he said "I'm afraid I don't". So I told him that it meant what he was like as a person and added that he was friendly and open and bright. He replied "Well I am very popular" and I laughed and told him to continue to be that way and treat everyone nicely. He said he always did that. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The next day, he mentioned playing darts and I remembered we had an electronic dart board in the hut by the kitchen. I got it out and it made his day so I gave it to him and he actually managed to get it through security at the airport.  I had to have a photo of him with his new darts and here he is dressed too in his RM shirt. Love this little boy.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">That morning, Thursday, life was back to normal here as Eladio was home. All three dogs got their walk. Then we had to do the food shopping, a chore I hate, especially putting everything away. I felt tempted to go in the pool which would have helped but didn't want to disturb our guests. It was just too hot under the trees in the garden so both Eladio and I read in our study that afternoon which has air conditioning thank goodness. I read until my eyes could no longer see. This week saw me reading a best seller by an author called Martina Cole. I read her first book, "Dangerous Lady", which is a bit like "Peaky Blinders" but set in London. It's a good crime book, if a little violent, and I am now reading the sequel, "Maura's game". </span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">For some reason, on Thursday, I thought it was Friday and so booked a table for dinner that night. When I realised it was actually Thursday I decided to go ahead with the reservation and took Eladio to my latest favourite, El Kiosko, in nearby Boadilla. I had booked a table on the terrace but at 8.30 pm it was far too hot to eat outside so we got a table inside. If it was too hot outside, it was too loud inside. Spaniards are loud and if the acoustics are not good it can be very annoying. We shared a starter (artichokes) and a main course (a sort of fish and chips) and each had a tiny tiny brownie for dessert. Their desserts are very small. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It was still boiling at 9 o'clock at night when we had dinner on the kitchen terrace. And even with the air con on, our room still felt too warm. I had to get into the shower and cool off and only then did I feel comfortable. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Friday was the peak in temperatures. On Saturday they began to descend slowly, to 39º c which is far too much still. It will only get back to normal in the middle of next week but by then we shall be in Montrondo and away from this suffocating heat.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Saturday dawned and we had lots to do to get the house, pool and garden ready for our next guests, a family of 4 from France.  Pippa would be a problem with the little girl as she doesn't like children, thus we would hide her during their stay.  They were coming in the afternoon so we did all we had to do in the morning. Our walk yesterday was even earlier than usual, again to escape the heat, when we left the house at 7.45.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Oli was home from Vitoria just on time for lunch. She complained of the heat (39ºc) but she had missed Friday the hottest day of the year and the most suffocating day I have known ever since I came to live in Spain in 1981.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">A siesta was in order in our air conditioned rooms after lunch. I sleep a short siesta so not long after was downstairs and went straight into the pool. At around 5.30 pm our French guests from Normandy arrived: Peggy the mother who speaks perfect English, Jerome the father, 17 year old Clement and a very beautiful little girl, Marian aged 7. I fell in love with her immediately. I showed them around the house and garden and they spent time settling in. Meanwhile, Oli and Eladio were up and joined me on the benches under the trees by the pool. After one last bathe - in order to leave the pool to the guests - off we went on down to the garden to under the trees to have some private and quiet family time. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We spent a lovely afternoon together. Yes it was hot at 39ºc but believe me, you notice the difference when it's 3 degrees less. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Before dinner, both Oli and I needed a cold shower; it must have been my 3rd that day!. Dinner was simple, salad, ham, gazpacho and bread followed by delicious summer fruit.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Eladio announced that Netflix was showing the famous Spanish series called "Fariña" about the drug trafficking business that went on in Galicia in the north west of Spain for many years. The book had been banned but the series has been very popular here and we were keen to watch it. So, on our large 1.80 bed, the three of us, together with Pippa, watched the first episode and part of the 2nd in our air conditioned room. We shall be watching more of it tonight and no doubt in Montrondo too when we go tomorrow. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Today is Sunday and it will be another scorcher so I am really looking forward to escaping the heat in Montrondo where it is usually 101ºc less than in Madrid. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It's only 07.15 as I write but I must finish soon if we want to get our early morning walk in before it gets too hot.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">So, my friends, that's it for this week.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Happy reading everyone,</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Cheers till next Sunday/Masha</span></div>
