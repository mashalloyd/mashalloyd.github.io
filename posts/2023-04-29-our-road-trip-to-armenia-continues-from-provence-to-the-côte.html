Just another 4000 km to Armenia. I keep wondering if we really will get there. But, so far, so good. We are in the capital of Croatia at the moment after having traveled all the way from Madrid, so many kilometres  and so many more to go too. We are tired, of course, but enjoying each moment. It really is the trip of our life.</p><p>It was only a week ago today that we left our lovely Airbnb, the best so far, in Barbantane, near Avignon, run by Mireille and Jean Louis. They were also the best hosts, so far. Here are some photos of our last moments there after a splendid breakfast served to us in their dining room including a fresh French baguette which, for me, if it is good, is unbeatable. </p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJoZ19uOHaBHoMf8btPXGCP3BcrqW-7G9JbTMYdfxYWzaT__f1Zcng2--kXtPk9himLD6D6RxK6DjikAGUEvQQzmnSkZOBLxMvv_kuj_EQfkX_W6zuUS390Nre90ycUJtKmMY8GyekVxcOD4fC6pHFWNyVkt1oJ7izIBiZ89fffmnKqc5pkFM/s4032/20230423_092226.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJoZ19uOHaBHoMf8btPXGCP3BcrqW-7G9JbTMYdfxYWzaT__f1Zcng2--kXtPk9himLD6D6RxK6DjikAGUEvQQzmnSkZOBLxMvv_kuj_EQfkX_W6zuUS390Nre90ycUJtKmMY8GyekVxcOD4fC6pHFWNyVkt1oJ7izIBiZ89fffmnKqc5pkFM/w400-h180/20230423_092226.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><p><br></br></p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgF_YSh9wU9kmwAuPb3VVgNREeUiJY_B_XWsR5Z8KPR-tjUQd1lXMcmGw6RIj-iBHz1sATcKxOdiPpKAXh4dj17IMdQdu0bl9VOoy16Ltw8QDLJrVwc3i9G8eveN__UDqsuX9_fyTktR23XHdqRFOP-FN4RALT9UYsI2zzACaqB-vli83Ea9fc/s4032/20230423_092211.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgF_YSh9wU9kmwAuPb3VVgNREeUiJY_B_XWsR5Z8KPR-tjUQd1lXMcmGw6RIj-iBHz1sATcKxOdiPpKAXh4dj17IMdQdu0bl9VOoy16Ltw8QDLJrVwc3i9G8eveN__UDqsuX9_fyTktR23XHdqRFOP-FN4RALT9UYsI2zzACaqB-vli83Ea9fc/w400-h180/20230423_092211.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our Airbnb home stay in Barbentane. See our little car, the Mini, behaving so well, so far. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br>After our stay in Provence, last Sunday our destination  was to Biot on the Côte d'Azur but first we wanted to visit a pretty little village, Villeneuve-lès -Avignon, which we didn't have time to see the day before because of our horrible excursion to a giant Auchan hypermarket to replenish items left behind in a bag on the street in Blanes (damn). I had read it was as beautiful as Avignon. It is, I think, and, as most French villages, is beautifully kept. It also lies on the imposing Rhône River and has a Fort at the top of the hill, The Fort St. André, but we didn't have time to visit it. We did see though the Philippe-le-Bel Tower, another local landmark. I wondered why it was "bel" and not "beau" and my French speaking friends told me that is the old fashioned word for "handsome"; another little French lesson of which I had many during our time in beautiful France. The tower is where the famous St. Bénézet Bridge in Avignon should end but it is broken off now. Otherwise you could walk across the river to the bigger city. We contented ourselves just walking around the pretty streets taking in a Sunday morning in a small French village. It was a pity we had had breakfast as there were many tempting places to have a café au lait with a croissant which I adore. Here are a couple of photos for you to get an idea of what a pretty place it is. <br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsPs0aFQhfQsjWjHEdGgaHzzg2IndL4pnEJlzcbzgKP_kegx-wvsrD38NvNNO_SuZDcHT4G0sNrLi-SHdRBZdFR3WCQ0wFWfEPKIjLbm72_FUS2xNwxnz2CuSNFYJOD-E_fS1FQHsAtNm_XDJbkJwME3JPT-NwBl8R5U1R9D7_mZkuC4xq_uE/s4032/20230423_100222.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsPs0aFQhfQsjWjHEdGgaHzzg2IndL4pnEJlzcbzgKP_kegx-wvsrD38NvNNO_SuZDcHT4G0sNrLi-SHdRBZdFR3WCQ0wFWfEPKIjLbm72_FUS2xNwxnz2CuSNFYJOD-E_fS1FQHsAtNm_XDJbkJwME3JPT-NwBl8R5U1R9D7_mZkuC4xq_uE/w180-h400/20230423_100222.jpg" width="180"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMAtn1lmC7c_7-8mKDO8rYy_lzFwHwqGV5ob73hgHvcNNpSPUSE4L38Yz7nBsbvAc0buJoEhgyxXUYYPS7cLG3dUtFkSgosm-3U-Lr6kjef3492LOlwUJ0FkWJK4SdXR_i0qt27ZlVrBbzcFu8xZtNeeZOShCqwZb9Xt5a_DjAMNliqQnpQqg/s2719/20230423_110339.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMAtn1lmC7c_7-8mKDO8rYy_lzFwHwqGV5ob73hgHvcNNpSPUSE4L38Yz7nBsbvAc0buJoEhgyxXUYYPS7cLG3dUtFkSgosm-3U-Lr6kjef3492LOlwUJ0FkWJK4SdXR_i0qt27ZlVrBbzcFu8xZtNeeZOShCqwZb9Xt5a_DjAMNliqQnpQqg/w255-h400/20230423_110339.jpg" width="255"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Enjoying Villeneuve-lés-Avignon</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Another lesson was about the word "l'atelier". I know it means workshop but it is used for literally any kind of business you can imagine in French. That puzzled me but now I know. <div><br></br></div><div>From Villeneuve to Biot, near Antibes, we had a 247km drive on very expensive motorways. The prices are scandalous but there is not much option. If we had chosen to drive on normal roads it would have taken 4 hours instead of 2.5. Biot is famous for its relationship with the Templar Knights (Crusades and Freemasonry). It's very pretty too. We  were staying just outside on a long street with many expensive looking houses. The Côte d'Azur is quite a luxurious area. The house we had chosen was this, run by Martine and her daughter Jade. They gave us a warm welcome. <br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvKa5DHkl2A5Na3ikFm2jyyijOwuo6RHyVOFvFFoMiLh9km5_CTMZo13cFgMCeo-1iqqO3-J9h47Yl2SgxlJErxUTdEh5pbmdgAIlsNZW9KmNm9kSin4FvZa8f7gCwRJw-7WOsgbDbkLqCMMRpvY-uLKZ4Cit9eNKXmiYTkJJJKxpF5Y4NfR0/s4032/20230423_155649.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvKa5DHkl2A5Na3ikFm2jyyijOwuo6RHyVOFvFFoMiLh9km5_CTMZo13cFgMCeo-1iqqO3-J9h47Yl2SgxlJErxUTdEh5pbmdgAIlsNZW9KmNm9kSin4FvZa8f7gCwRJw-7WOsgbDbkLqCMMRpvY-uLKZ4Cit9eNKXmiYTkJJJKxpF5Y4NfR0/w400-h180/20230423_155649.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our shared Airbnb near Biot</i></td></tr></tbody></table>It's a very beautiful property and the pool was open so wow I thought until I looked closer and saw dust everywhere. The kitchen area was not good and the fridge looked like it hadn't been cleaned for a long time. I didn't like to say anything but I could have given Martine a lesson on upping her standards. I should have left her a bad review but I didn't as the place was perfect otherwise and our hosts so kind.</div><div><br></br></div><div>We settled in, had a bite for lunch, rested for an hour - me by the pool - and then drove the short 2km drive to the village of Biot. And, oh, I fell in love with it - the pretty stone streets with all the flowers, the Places des Arcades and beautiful houses. I noticed signs everywhere in French but in another language too. It was "langue d'oc" of course which is spoken in the region and looks like Catalan - very similar. What a place, no wonder it is well known and popular. It's just 5km from the beach and there are sea views everywhere. I took tons of photos - here are just 3 to share with you if you don't know Biot. What a beautiful location I had chosen. Maybe in another life we shall come and stay in the area to explore it better. I already knew Cannes and Nice so we skipped them and Biot is a much nicer place to stay if you are driving a car. <br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiYsXOFT7tsQP4Ve14JAAImJJQvhpkkWctz1P4BYdIpTVHtnbAPkePOz5sSj5iMdEj1CleUsjrk493mrIp6_U6j5031QffBK5hHSK48yWqkw0aVRLnLXDG9riKsyM3AJv50_P_PhZDjSKrhQsKl1MzSD2U-j10u8RC8Q4mhIHC3vtHZi6PpCMc/s4032/20230423_172548.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiYsXOFT7tsQP4Ve14JAAImJJQvhpkkWctz1P4BYdIpTVHtnbAPkePOz5sSj5iMdEj1CleUsjrk493mrIp6_U6j5031QffBK5hHSK48yWqkw0aVRLnLXDG9riKsyM3AJv50_P_PhZDjSKrhQsKl1MzSD2U-j10u8RC8Q4mhIHC3vtHZi6PpCMc/w400-h180/20230423_172548.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnGl0w13tTNBZ3S4k1C-GqdcGUiXnM6hI7GZF0aveSSkocxRBOn0A155Ab5YGbs3QjYyG6z-zr-xmWCxN5Vo9GLHCaAO6AQpSwgBL4Usjh-75C5OFdmGA2B-G2_DYq0a234RnP14HWwoAnrpo-rX1SD4aa9zc2ppjcOXXBRubN5CZuwSdm-GA/s4032/20230423_173308.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgnGl0w13tTNBZ3S4k1C-GqdcGUiXnM6hI7GZF0aveSSkocxRBOn0A155Ab5YGbs3QjYyG6z-zr-xmWCxN5Vo9GLHCaAO6AQpSwgBL4Usjh-75C5OFdmGA2B-G2_DYq0a234RnP14HWwoAnrpo-rX1SD4aa9zc2ppjcOXXBRubN5CZuwSdm-GA/w400-h180/20230423_173308.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcifDMFSjKueu49YTzX2u6IlsfXzNTVdWKWhNbsx8Y9qFOI2RJSCIdL8kkCxhLwJKR4JzY9MQpT1BynciqLQ4AKkgrFAhlyoEmevzqzdfmrnc1BUr9cy5yflvQqJSpUTMN9pVnDut0i9Xt9UuvPwzX2C_VFWNVZYsRVvjvuGRsSaOmeFR80HU/s4032/20230423_174745.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcifDMFSjKueu49YTzX2u6IlsfXzNTVdWKWhNbsx8Y9qFOI2RJSCIdL8kkCxhLwJKR4JzY9MQpT1BynciqLQ4AKkgrFAhlyoEmevzqzdfmrnc1BUr9cy5yflvQqJSpUTMN9pVnDut0i9Xt9UuvPwzX2C_VFWNVZYsRVvjvuGRsSaOmeFR80HU/w180-h400/20230423_174745.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Beautiful Biot</i></td></tr></tbody></table>After we had had our fill of Biot, we decided to drive to nearby Valbonne, recommended to us by our hostess. I think we should have chosen Grasse - probably prettier - but you can't see everything.

We are not drinkers really so when I don't know what to order in the afternoon and it can't be tea or coffee because of the caffeine, I choose mint tea. For words I didn't know in French during our time in France, I used Google and gosh my vocab increased beautifully during those 3 days there. I left Eladio to buy some salad ingredients and suddenly realised I didn't know how to say lettuce in French. I knew tomato and avocado but not lettuce, funnily enough.  I didn't know it simply because I have never bought lettuce in France. My father who was an amazing linguist always said that when you learn vocab you have to use it to remember it. The word is "latuie", one I will now remember because I used it. <br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div>Thus it was salad for dinner with some of our excellent Spanish ham of which we have brought packets and packets for our meals on route. We made our meal while our hostesses watched the Simpsons on TV in their huge lounge! Then it was early to bed after spending some  time uploading photos, responding to emails, etc. I got a better night's sleep in Biot.</div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Monday</b> dawned and before heading for Italy, we were to visit Antibes and also see a friend, Andy, our ex Airbnb guest who is actually Scottish. He lived with us for more than a year and a half and we became good friends. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Apart from seeing Andy, I really wanted to visit Antibes which conjures up the magic of the Côte d'Azur, it really does. I have been to Cannes and Nice on many occasion but never Antibes. I first came across the place when I read a short story  by Somerset Maugham many years ago. Called "<a href="https://www.haroldschogger.com/three_fat_women.htm">Three fat women of Antibes</a>" - it's a great story and quite funny. But of course it is also famous because Picasso lived there. One place that sprung to mind during our time on the French Riviera, the most luxurious and richest part of France, was Cap d'Antibes and I wanted to see it. I did that day, but at a distance.</div><div><br></br></div><div>We left our Airbnb in Biot - lovely place, lovely people, but frankly a bit dirty, early at around 9 am and drove the 10km or less to Antibes. We parked next to the old town as instructed by Andy. Couldn't believe we paid 23 euros for 2 or 3 hours - told you it was expensive. As we walked out of the car park this was the view we were greeted with - the port and the snow capped Alps in the background and Italy of course.

I prefer to wait till Turkey and the Caucasus. Every town in France has a street called Rue de la Republique or Charles de Gaulle - the French are a  nation that is very proud of its history and traditions. We walked along the latter, just to get a feel of the place and it is a beautiful town. I did look in the shops though as I needed a coffee maker - mine got lost when Eladio left our bag with picnic stuff on the street in Blanes (hahaha) and I found it at Monoprix. I first came across this well known French chain of department stores when I went to Paris on a school trip aged 14. Ah ha, I said,  I might find a new French press there and, bingo, I did. Now I  could be sure of being able to make coffee every morning on our trip. Once inside Monoprix we also went into the food department for more provisions to last us a few days. Eladio went for the smoked mackerel and I made a bee line for prawns and "rilette de porc", a sort of fatty meat spread - not paté or foie, but oh so delicious. I first discovered it at my cousin Zuka's place in France. Love it. Here is Eladio outside Monoprix. He is holding their supermarket bag which I shall use with pleasure in Spain - much nicer than using Mercadona bags hahahaha. <br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCKCmJBjK8-cogYJk7GEoxBZFXqO2UkXjlK05FLlrEJboi4cqnJjepiIfsUXHKB_3lK22AqRDOdsHH842lKRps_udc_cNA3Na3Brv8YjuEKgRH5J5HggyL8EyolhtdxDkV4pW2jVzZsBxCyb9VBEyx16WQkd3EVIft3PH5yB3XZ5bSmIRo5gA/s4032/20230424_103337.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCKCmJBjK8-cogYJk7GEoxBZFXqO2UkXjlK05FLlrEJboi4cqnJjepiIfsUXHKB_3lK22AqRDOdsHH842lKRps_udc_cNA3Na3Brv8YjuEKgRH5J5HggyL8EyolhtdxDkV4pW2jVzZsBxCyb9VBEyx16WQkd3EVIft3PH5yB3XZ5bSmIRo5gA/w400-h180/20230424_103337.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio coming out of Monoprix in Antibes where I found my French cafetiere and we bought some lovely food provisions. </i></td></tr></tbody></table>We then walked slowly back to the Place National stopping at a wonderful boulangerie to get a sandwich for me and a piece of quiche for Eladio for that day's lunch on our way to Genova in Italy. When you see a queue outside a French baker shop, you know the produce is of the highest quality. While there, I couldn't resist buying a small fruit tart and strawberry mousse. <div><br></br></div><div>We met Andy at Le Vieil Antibes coffee, arriving before him so as to find a table. The waitress had a very thick south of France accent but she was easy to understand. My mother was sent to school in Cannes at the age of 6, sent there from Bulgaria for 4 years. She, of course, learned French quickly but always told me, she acquired the local accent which when she only got rid of in later years. Oh, but my mother spoke perfect French, loving what they call "argot" (slang). She also  loved engaging with French lorry drivers using argot who she understood perfectly. So I thought of her when I spoke to the local waitress, a lady in her 60's at least and with a smile on her face. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Andy who lives in the centre, was soon with us. It had been 3 years since he left us just before Covid lockdown  when he quickly left his job as a coach at Banco Santander and drove all the way back home from Madrid to escape it. His room has been called "Andy's room" forever since. What a wonderful man he is. He is Scottish and, like me, also worked for Motorola. It was on a sabbatical from their Danish branch that he came to Antibes. He must have fallen in love with it as he is still there, apart from the short time in Spain with us. In his time with us he became a friend, almost a family member, so our reunion with Andy was very special. It was great to meet a friend on our journey. We shall be meeting more - some of them ex Airbnb guests, like Andy, who have become friends. We got someone to take a few photos to remember the reunion, like this one below. <br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg178jvSRomuIHR5OfFDJsYmx-7UKqkPTFM9TATB_Ek8G_h_mhCDuEKoHJQSO30jqmpicMYm-Gqli9K91miPlvftZhVYW7BlHuhBuhEJzYoFBuV9Qdl6xaf0rO_wtefPIIjN1YdaC7S8RZ15mkDCL-rYKy_ai5rRDcrIiA0Y-Rb-k2ZuoySXM8/s3291/20230424_114247.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="221" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg178jvSRomuIHR5OfFDJsYmx-7UKqkPTFM9TATB_Ek8G_h_mhCDuEKoHJQSO30jqmpicMYm-Gqli9K91miPlvftZhVYW7BlHuhBuhEJzYoFBuV9Qdl6xaf0rO_wtefPIIjN1YdaC7S8RZ15mkDCL-rYKy_ai5rRDcrIiA0Y-Rb-k2ZuoySXM8/w400-h221/20230424_114247.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A photo of our reunion with Andy</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We spent an hour at least in that lovely square catching up on our lives since Covid. There was so much to say and to ask. Before we left, Andy showed us part of Antibes which maybe we wouldn't have seen without him. We saw the Cathedral with its history of the Templar Knights as well as the castle. Andy</div><div>explained that the name of the town, Antibes, comes from the Greek, meaning "the town on the other side" but which side, Nice or Cannes? No one knows. We also saw the Picasso museum housed in the castle where the painter lived. Unfortunately, being a Monday it was closed. <br></br><br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcBx1QDSybYY97ouqiZxRqHkQplfEooy7GX-j6J2krGmPoG6_Zj-PKsqZhlaYmMttPE9iMV0ZQCSk-A-FdUPVZNZUUrtHDoracvQeHcYzwaDFBxU6loR7_wgHXYBQttqGZNUZv28_XOA30WBAPr2SIu9kA7kDUoqrqDCyNOoa5Iz_J7kvNRac/w400-h180/20230424_120112.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="400"></img></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Picasso Museum.<br></br></i><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcBx1QDSybYY97ouqiZxRqHkQplfEooy7GX-j6J2krGmPoG6_Zj-PKsqZhlaYmMttPE9iMV0ZQCSk-A-FdUPVZNZUUrtHDoracvQeHcYzwaDFBxU6loR7_wgHXYBQttqGZNUZv28_XOA30WBAPr2SIu9kA7kDUoqrqDCyNOoa5Iz_J7kvNRac/s4032/20230424_120112.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ee;"><u><br></br></u></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;">Close by is the sea from where you can see what I wanted to see, "Cap d'Antibes".

I told one of the staff it was the most beautiful service station in France - a nice young man who helped us out with pre paying filling our tank - so different to what we are used to. Soon we were on our way again, a 200km drive or so which would take us longer than we thought. Soon, too we were in Italy. The roads changed - they are better in France- and oh my God how fast the Italians drive. The road was dangerous, lots of bends, endless tunnels and lots of lorries. Eladio is a great driver but was feeling sleepy so I had to take the wheel and it felt like being in a rally. I had never concentrated on my driving as much as that day.</div><div><br></br></div><div>But it didn't end there. Our Airbnb was supposedly near Genova - about 20km - but it took us ages as the location was high up in the mountains in an area called Capanne di Marcarolo (National Park) in Piadmont. That name took me back to history lessons at St. Joseph's College when Miss Scorer taught us about the Unification of Italy, hahahaha. The drive was pretty frightening but I made it until suddenly a huge tractor type vehicle was coming towards us and we both had to stop as the road was so narrow. That's when let Eladio take over. It seemed an age until our Sat nav told us we were at our destination. Except, that we weren't. We were a bit lost and had to call the owner but coverage was patchy. Finally we found it, a tiny little mountain cabin which seemed like something out of Heidi. This was our <a href="https://abnb.me/WxAeWEHvgzb">place</a>.

So off we set down that terribly windy and narrow road which took us to the motorway. Eladio drove and we both commented just how fast the Italians drive on their motorways (autostradi). But often there are 3 lanes which makes competition for overtaking lorries easier, hahahaha. The tolls are probably even more expensive than in France and even the petrol is at 2 euros per litre. In France they have  a complicated system of pre paying for petrol where you have to choose how much to fill up with. It has stumped us a bit and we needed help. So, when we drove into a petrol station on our way to Venice that day, I was delighted to see a real person waiting for us, a person who would fill our tank personally and then charge us there and then with the card. How civilized I thought and so much easier. </span><div><span style="text-align: center;"><br></br></span></div><div><span style="text-align: center;">We decided to stop off in Verona which was on our way. I mean we couldn't not stop to see a little bit of the City of Love made famous by Shakespeare. He was inspired by an Italian novel of some kind to write Romeo and Juliet and Verona is supposedly where Juliet's house is and people queue to see the balcony. Apparently it was added in the 19th century for tourists (boo hoo). I was interested in Shakespeare's obsession with  Italy where 13 of his 38 plays are set - that's a lot, 3 of which are set in Verona. No one knows if he ever went there but maybe he did. There are many reasons he set his plays in Italy - it was in fashion, its people passionate - so good for drama - but also because if in his plays he wanted to criticise English politics which he did, setting them in Italy would distract any criticism towards his politics, or something like that. I read this <a href="https://www.sightseeingtoursitaly.com/tips-articles/shakespeares-italian-obsession/">here</a> </span><div><div style="text-align: center;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Verona has other places of more historical significance, mainly the Arena, the Roman amphitheatre where operas are held, but this was a flying visit so we only saw it from the outside. </div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgt8FVOXNhQyqamQhIyQUrKvmfdQlzzgjUIuehY-56n1ewgi6qGN3FqWZmL60QXwWMuQx-5BWafBzj-sXLNHOsHpPdmKa5KEkoe1AYxoD8IMHm3nvK74_DNLTCZt9ac9QnLpTghiBHj-8mi1uF9XGvyVOpH7Rwk0iipXyJx2ZoV4EEyCaVGWZQ/s3360/20230425_132611.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="204" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgt8FVOXNhQyqamQhIyQUrKvmfdQlzzgjUIuehY-56n1ewgi6qGN3FqWZmL60QXwWMuQx-5BWafBzj-sXLNHOsHpPdmKa5KEkoe1AYxoD8IMHm3nvK74_DNLTCZt9ac9QnLpTghiBHj-8mi1uF9XGvyVOpH7Rwk0iipXyJx2ZoV4EEyCaVGWZQ/w400-h204/20230425_132611.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio outside the Arena in Verona</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We were lucky to find a free parking space in the street but had to walk quite a way to the centre as cars are not allowed - no wonder as there are far too many people. Tourism in Italy is a bit much and I was put off by the huge queue to get into Casa di Guiletta. We should have bought the tickets online to get in but something didn't work and you can't buy them physically. Thankfully though the visit to the patio and balcony is free. But we waited more than half an hour. This is it with Eladio in front. <br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkkuaBcGR64Rr3pDwV28BkfPDvG9LvDeSPVGXxFfTBCvDQvjYuXF7QqugbtSbK7MfYQOsCDwO-h3N_-GHg4YrLJSYOy-uS1sFhZ1x80gaUPfOP6W83hAF_cVB1DUxcq48TysVjoByzEOgBUVNhQ9_aA4z4p7zHGCFPTjeNGcuX6OMlrgHtpBo/s4032/20230425_142500.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkkuaBcGR64Rr3pDwV28BkfPDvG9LvDeSPVGXxFfTBCvDQvjYuXF7QqugbtSbK7MfYQOsCDwO-h3N_-GHg4YrLJSYOy-uS1sFhZ1x80gaUPfOP6W83hAF_cVB1DUxcq48TysVjoByzEOgBUVNhQ9_aA4z4p7zHGCFPTjeNGcuX6OMlrgHtpBo/w180-h400/20230425_142500.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Juliet's supposed balcony</i></td></tr></tbody></table>In the same courtyard/patio there is a statue of her which I think doesn't look at all as how I imagine her. I loved Franco Zeffirelli's Rome and Juliet film which I saw many times and bought the "LP" of the soundtrack. So, that's how I imagined Juliet played by a very young Olivia Hussey, not by the statue in Verona. In any case, we had to have a photo with it for which there was another queue.<br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjf-dzJxGsxHjnXxuIlSZ8ot6WUfslD02BUPssKsKTE2WY_-WG2w1W1qGbnCzVUS-WcippFJZt7pBt5b-Kv7GpmBriyjgxkeMyt22ZrUvWMxk0JZwLs4cN-A6OoAkx2vcjKCEpoX6I0Tqt9bLV-7-b_uEzKmn4UAY-Vwch9QJ8kwO348mYF_Do/s1600/IMG-20230425-WA0005.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjf-dzJxGsxHjnXxuIlSZ8ot6WUfslD02BUPssKsKTE2WY_-WG2w1W1qGbnCzVUS-WcippFJZt7pBt5b-Kv7GpmBriyjgxkeMyt22ZrUvWMxk0JZwLs4cN-A6OoAkx2vcjKCEpoX6I0Tqt9bLV-7-b_uEzKmn4UAY-Vwch9QJ8kwO348mYF_Do/w238-h400/IMG-20230425-WA0005.jpg" width="238"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>By Juliet's statue, not really like I imagine her<br></br><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div></i></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: justify;">There is a place for people to leave heart shaped padlocks - see below - a bit much I thought and wonder what they did with all the old ones.

This was ours and I have to say the dough was out of this world, thin, soft and crispy all at the same time. We had it with some lovely local wine.

It was about 1.20h to Dogaletto and after a while I took the wheel as Eladio was feeling sleepy. It didn't take long to find our next Airbnb, a much larger accommodation than the tiny mountain hut hahaha. This is the <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/15202790?source_impression_id=p3_1681711361_eSQ7VThBZT%2FQ4cKE">house</a> we stayed at. Our room is the one on the second floor with a huge balcony. Michelle, the young owner, greeted us and welcomed us in. It was a nice big house, not my style inside but everything was clean. The best part was our huge room with an enormous bed with a memory foam mattress, not to mention our own bathroom. When looking for accommodation I have 4 requisites; private bathroom, use of kitchen, wifi and somewhere to park. This was it - notice the recycling bins - very strict in Italy. Spain is way behind when it comes to recycling, I'm afraid. <br></br><br></br><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRm-CcIjZoGCXkdiMiK5bgppQ45oZDvcc06cxCC-8EjaLpgY2z1zXzIMeZ-vxWVhsD_EvY9XqRM3byQWHsqVoA67A9d6vzZ9izFIgzIbwYJqOSJJBT6Bri0P3EFikuQqmTraMBbNg_sQ46PqEtXjc78W8Z0Ix-ZCO3TpyC3X2VJzkyOxX6t7Q/s4032/20230425_185919.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRm-CcIjZoGCXkdiMiK5bgppQ45oZDvcc06cxCC-8EjaLpgY2z1zXzIMeZ-vxWVhsD_EvY9XqRM3byQWHsqVoA67A9d6vzZ9izFIgzIbwYJqOSJJBT6Bri0P3EFikuQqmTraMBbNg_sQ46PqEtXjc78W8Z0Ix-ZCO3TpyC3X2VJzkyOxX6t7Q/w400-h180/20230425_185919.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br></br></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqXi39slIw6Y5r4qtCMJi0qkq-35yIJYNcG3Sch2BccGVab-eN4DFBjijiPcVoU1cUvTlnITIQIVjJ-nTGVIiazaJKtwBoP84T2-YayZMowlEBVwaFc_ZcnoMhqJRSQzAz1wE08pO-Fso-KOiSFA0RDb3pTHQxzg0ZlSk3LCjqJDh49BhUNV8/s4032/20230425_185856.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqXi39slIw6Y5r4qtCMJi0qkq-35yIJYNcG3Sch2BccGVab-eN4DFBjijiPcVoU1cUvTlnITIQIVjJ-nTGVIiazaJKtwBoP84T2-YayZMowlEBVwaFc_ZcnoMhqJRSQzAz1wE08pO-Fso-KOiSFA0RDb3pTHQxzg0ZlSk3LCjqJDh49BhUNV8/w400-h180/20230425_185856.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our house with a space for our car in Dogaletto near Venice.

We had to recharge our batteries for 3 nights and 2 days visiting Venice. One of the things I did though was to book our accommodation in Ljubliana and Zagreb, our next destinations after Venice. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We slept like babies on the wonderful memory foam mattress. I woke up at 6 am on <b>Wednesday</b> morning but had gone to bed early, so was feeling refreshed. Wednesday was the day we were going to see Venice for the first time; one of the most important visits of this road trip. I have travelled all over the world but never to Venice so this was a dream come true. Our place was 17km from the city which you cannot drive to so we drove to the nearest bus stop and took the bus to the city. It left us at Piazzela di Roma. The first thing we saw was a canal except that we were told later it was a river, New River. Not all the canals are canals apparently. Venice is an archipelago on the Adriatic Sea,  each island reached by a bridge over a canal or river or by boat of some kind  - a real maze. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Venice, the pearl of the Adriatic and one of the most unique cities and most beautiful, in the world, has many names:  La Dominante, Serenissima, Queen of the Adriatic, City of Water, City of Masks, City of Bridges, the Floating City and City of Canals. I would call it also a City of Dreams. It is totally spell binding as I would come to realise when I explored just a small part of it. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Everyone who gets off the bus heads, like we would, to Piazza di San Marco which is a 2.4km walk. But before that we spotted our first gondola and just had to get on it. I realised later we should have done so on the Grand Canal for better views, but never mind. Rafaele, was our "captain" and we were his "passageiri"hahha. I know some Italian from having done a course about 40 odd years ago. It was after studying Spanish and Portuguese and I remember getting a bit mixed up but I did learn the basics, especially the pronunciation and it was fun trying to speak the lingo while in the country. </div><div><br></br></div><div>And this is Rafaele</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvZRUusOHSZbiHuNJo5ptDJKFrv22gALqN4eeWfDNbGkUl9HOZ9CWDmrzMW9TQShLiu_Bramzh0gi1nN2wpD0-SSLI-IXEhGEofbbt37waGBqjd8AD5Oe99WH_jXORrDLOXeQMoKeelb4ISTfNhHsyRRzFJlVYwfXjkZ5fBg2SxM6S75UtjBE/s4032/20230426_104437.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvZRUusOHSZbiHuNJo5ptDJKFrv22gALqN4eeWfDNbGkUl9HOZ9CWDmrzMW9TQShLiu_Bramzh0gi1nN2wpD0-SSLI-IXEhGEofbbt37waGBqjd8AD5Oe99WH_jXORrDLOXeQMoKeelb4ISTfNhHsyRRzFJlVYwfXjkZ5fBg2SxM6S75UtjBE/w180-h400/20230426_104437.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Rafaele, our gondolere</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Gondolas only exist in Venice and were first used in the 11th century and are unique to the city. Today there are some 500 in use. The ride was just 30 minutes and we saw many churches of which there are over 130, as well as water taxis and all sorts of boats. I was interested to see boats offloading goods for bars and restaurants, even dustbin boats or ambulances. The ride on the gondola was the highlight of our day in Venice on Wednesday. We couldn't have gone on a better day as the weather was perfect, sunshine and about 18ºc.

Thankfully there are signs everywhere and where there weren't we used Google Maps. The signs are mostly to the square but also the Rialto (high river) where one of the most famous bridges is.

And, finally, we found the heart of the city where the Basilica or Cathedral is. There too is the Palazzo Ducal and the Bell tower (the tallest building in the city) and the beautiful clock tower. This, my friends, is the Basilica - a mixture of Byzantine, Romanesque and Gothic architecture. I've never seen such a beautiful cathedral in my life and neither has Eladio who knows a lot about cathedrals having studied theology and been a priest. <br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoQheT02CGEwMBXqabkuUK2FPJ5FyCujDWbex6C9FTJLbSgXi-HwWIrxKbAq3VypZitPH8j-MfrgCL52GPF9LkRyr95jNLcG97Mq4di2iZ7TWM5dpvERAdprgdfhgrHEb83xsZa0s_Ttdq4M2pMNq3pNPDI1r_gZWAKsQV2PZ2TEjErwTq1eE/s3681/20230426_121939.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="198" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoQheT02CGEwMBXqabkuUK2FPJ5FyCujDWbex6C9FTJLbSgXi-HwWIrxKbAq3VypZitPH8j-MfrgCL52GPF9LkRyr95jNLcG97Mq4di2iZ7TWM5dpvERAdprgdfhgrHEb83xsZa0s_Ttdq4M2pMNq3pNPDI1r_gZWAKsQV2PZ2TEjErwTq1eE/w400-h198/20230426_121939.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Basilica at St. Mark's Square is magnifent</i></td></tr></tbody></table>As to the square it is unique and huge, difficult to take in. Often in these past few months when we were having our morning coffee in Boadilla, I would say to Eladio, close you eyes and imagine having a coffee in St. Mark's Square which is what we did on Wednesday. We chose the most famous bar, Lavena where the waiters come from times gone past as does the bar itself. There was a live band playing wonderful music. I took a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nifAu90Wm84">video</a> of this most  unique moment for us which you can see here. This was after ordering a capuccino at 16 euros a cup, but I thought it was worth it. A fellow tourist took this photo of the two of us which rivals with the feature photo of us on the gondola.<br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQRWcYVpWSk0ZjtFJALOLl5Z-3hGMqNS8G6SjUKQL_B1xra0ipZ8109tmfBn05Fm2KTnyqk88eNmw2p5WKVuQwptDd_RK0hDXqU1CcQrRI9K5xG0RsEqBvoeguqhfJBBrOTFX9J-MU02VZrw52DoeRm2cAd1GT-wuj8lNzL7qaNJL9bK8-Ypo/s3763/20230426_123143.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="193" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQRWcYVpWSk0ZjtFJALOLl5Z-3hGMqNS8G6SjUKQL_B1xra0ipZ8109tmfBn05Fm2KTnyqk88eNmw2p5WKVuQwptDd_RK0hDXqU1CcQrRI9K5xG0RsEqBvoeguqhfJBBrOTFX9J-MU02VZrw52DoeRm2cAd1GT-wuj8lNzL7qaNJL9bK8-Ypo/w400-h193/20230426_123143.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Coffee in St. Mark's Square</i></td></tr></tbody></table>I took loads of photos but this one with the friendly waiter is my favourite. <br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQuGVTt0LmbmC8HcfsfGl9bKK7vx8OiApHr8vIFIfnUw29lbY2BqkdIlkFreyfgqy39ajZM0UnOvWRaaCDA4zlYxKFIuTq0V8aHtiHQ8EgjKtOsn3AbOaVorJn_mj19BkQ_AJisyirKtlSA2F7wQZVaXBZupQyLxYyWYXSg-f6lYcKA6R7K14/s4032/20230426_125030.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQuGVTt0LmbmC8HcfsfGl9bKK7vx8OiApHr8vIFIfnUw29lbY2BqkdIlkFreyfgqy39ajZM0UnOvWRaaCDA4zlYxKFIuTq0V8aHtiHQ8EgjKtOsn3AbOaVorJn_mj19BkQ_AJisyirKtlSA2F7wQZVaXBZupQyLxYyWYXSg-f6lYcKA6R7K14/w400-h180/20230426_125030.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio and the waiter</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We could have sat there all day but we had to see more.

It took a while to find the station but we did and were soon on the 53E bus back to the towon of "Malcontenta" - means not happy both in Spanish and Italian hahaha.  We were bushed when we got off but before heading home, made a visit to the local supermarket, or rather hyper market, IperLando, recommended to us by our host Michele. It was huge and excellent with prices similar to Spain, thus much cheaper than in France. We bought lots of fruit as well as bread, milk and some mortadela for me. And, of course, we bought some prosecco wine which is from the Veneto region. I also bought some gnocci which my host cooked for me, bless him. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We were soon home where we spent the rest of the afternoon and evening in a leisurely manner. Again I slept well and woke up early on <b>Thursday </b>morning when we had another day to look forward to in Venice. Our host recommended we visit some of the many islands that Venice is made up of. The most popular it seems are Murano, Torcello and Burano. I learned that Venice has 113 islands, 40 of them being inhabited. Amazing. </div><div><br></br></div><div>I wasn't sure how to get there, how to get tickets, etc, but I found out easily when I got to the Piazzele Roma (where the buses stop and next to the Grand Canal).

Of course I spoke to them. I couldn't resist it. One was from Rishworth in Calderdale near Sowerby Bridge - Happy Valley country and the other was from Liverpool - a "liverbird". They had worked together for Virgin airlines and were good friends. The Liverpudlian, a beautiful woman in her late 40's remarked to me that my husband was "gorgeous". I agreed, of course, but then she said it to him. He was totally taken a back but responded like a gentleman and said you are gorgeous. I told her he was my own George Clooney, hahahaha.

I spent the time uploading photos, responding to guests and updating my guest calendar - I got 5 new reservations for our 3 places; our home in Madrid, the house in Asturias and the apartment in Santa Pola - great stuff. That day at home a family of 7 from Indonesia arrived. Suzy was in charge of greeting them and was very excited to speak Indonesian to them. That day too, sadly, for me, at least, I bought a one way ticket to Bali for Suzy which is where she wants to live and to start life again. The next day was her birthday and she turned 39. She considered this her birthday present. For me it is a worry.</p><p>Dinner was a small affair but I loved the leftover gnocchi. Then it was early to bed and I slept sort of ok that night.

She won't be at home when we return either as she is leaving on 9th May to live in Bali again . Thankfully Oli would be with her and they were having dinner together that night to celebrate. And, oh, by the way, I have some news about Oli and Miguel. They are getting married on 16th June. It will be a low key wedding - not white bridal dress and they are marrying for practical purposes only. In any case, it will be a joyous occasion. </p><p>But home was far from our thoughts as we left Dogaletto for Ljubliana.  Finally we would be entering the Balkans, an area which I have never been to.

I looked up the policy on motorway tolls. They are prepaid and you have to register your car and your details online and then get a receipt which you must present at a service station. The system is called Dars Go. It was a bit complicated but as I am becoming a very good co pilot, I managed and as soon as we had passed the border I paid at a service station and we were ready to go. </div><div><br></br></div><div>I read up about Slovenia while Eladio drove. It is a small country, very green, lots of forests and mountains but with some coastline.  It belonged to many countries and empires before it declared its independence in 1991 when communism fell. Before, of course, it belonged to former Yugoslavia. Most Slovenians are Catholic, the population is only about 2 million and they speak Slovenian. Their language is a South Slavic language. The only word I learned was "hvala" which means thank you and is pronounced "vala". It is supposedly very close to Bulgarian, Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian. Curiously though they use the Latin Script and not Cyrillic. However, Cyrillic can be used too. I was intrigued by the accents on certain words. I think the correct word is "stresica" (in Slovenian) with the little upside down hat on the "c" and it  means "little roof".  This symbol/upside down circumflex or "caron" is used to to show that some letters are pronounced differently. In Slovenian, at least, and in Serbo Croatian,  and maybe others, the three letters   <span style="background-color: white; color: #202124; font-size: 20px;">č, š  ž</span><span style="background-color: white; color: #202124; font-size: 20px;"> </span>are pronounced "ch", "sh" and "je".   Frankly, I think the English alphabet could do well with introducing the "caron", hahahaha. This symbol is a  what is known in linguistics as a diacritical mark. Maybe some of you linguists out there can enlighten me further.  Today many Slovenians speak English as they do Italian on the coast. The country borders with Austria, Croatia, Hungary and Italy. As we drove to its capital Ljubliana, I saw vehicles from so many countries as I would everywhere in the region.</div><div><br></br></div><div>We soon reached the city and our <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/si/good-place-ljubljana.en-gb.html?aid=304142&amp;label=gen173nr-1FCA4oggI46AdIM1gEaEaIAQGYAQm4ARjIAQzYAQHoAQH4AQOIAgGoAgS4Au3CsqIGwAIB0gIkYWYxNDZjNjAtNzZlMS00Y2RkLWE4ZjUtMjcxOGViMjJhM2E02AIF4AIB">wonderful apartment</a>.

We were only staying one night - onto Zagreb the next day. The owners who have turned it into 11 apartments with most of them full when we were there, must be making a packet. The place was absolutely pristine. We loved it apart from the fact it was on the 3rd floor and there was no lift:-(</div><div><br></br></div><div>Eladio had looked up the main sights: the dragon bridge, the triple bridge, the cathedral of St. Nicholas, the boulevards, the food market - splendid - as well as one of the most important landmarks, the red church on the square by the triple bridge, the Franciscan Church of the Annunciation, as well, as a castle. There seem to have been castles and cathedrals in every town we have visited so far.  It was about 1.4km to reach the old town and it was a rather grey afternoon but at least it wasn't raining. Soon we arrived in the old town and the first thing we saw was the Dragon bridge. The dragon is a symbol of the city. Jason the founder of Ljubliana killed one. They say when a virgin crosses it, the dragons wag their tales. From its initial portrayal as a monster, it turned into the symbol and protector of the city. </div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGVAzJwA1Nn_43EtBrxoOwi6iSS_Skh4VxyaEGAIHACKI-aUgFCqsJ_vFQZcC60Im7ZxNRn-xkw7urxaZSQtuFkKdeI3N539gtoLtQShEy8sGsk-Dik-KvMKcGp9huAeofrN3yYAzh9HPlHZFllQswIUUXmAX7a8DOfRbRKrZGxuGjWndL1q8/s4032/20230428_153531.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjGVAzJwA1Nn_43EtBrxoOwi6iSS_Skh4VxyaEGAIHACKI-aUgFCqsJ_vFQZcC60Im7ZxNRn-xkw7urxaZSQtuFkKdeI3N539gtoLtQShEy8sGsk-Dik-KvMKcGp9huAeofrN3yYAzh9HPlHZFllQswIUUXmAX7a8DOfRbRKrZGxuGjWndL1q8/w400-h180/20230428_153531.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The dragon bridge in Ljubliana</i></td></tr></tbody></table>There are many bridges that cross the "Ljublianica" river.

But I did recognise one word - "street". I was happy to see it is "ulica" - just like Russian "ulitza". My limited knowledge of Russian will come in handy on our travels in the Balkans and possibly Georgia and Armenia. After more than 4 hours walking in the old city, we were tired. My smart watch told me we had walked more than 15.000 steps. No wonder my knee was beginning to hurt. But before we left I went back to a food stall offering Bosnian cuisine which I could not resist. There I bought my dinner, some flat bread with meat rolls and a tomato and pepper type sauce. </span></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was a short walk back to our apartment where I sat on the terrace before climbing the 3 floors.

I had booked our place in Zagreb but needed to book somewhere in Slavonski Grod (town in Croatia, the half way mark between <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/hr/niva-rooms.en-gb.html?label=gen173nr-1FCA4oggI46AdIM1gEaEaIAQGYAQm4ARjIAQzYAQHoAQH4AQOIAgGoAgS4Au3CsqIGwAIB0gIkYWYxNDZjNjAtNzZlMS00Y2RkLWE4ZjUtMjcxOGViMjJhM2E02AIF4AIB&amp;sid=9e1e15fc02deb2156a15b1f47ea52760&amp;aid=304142"><span style="color: black;">Zagreb</span></a> and Belgrade), Belgrade and of course Sofia. I found what I hoped would be lovely places and booked them there and then. I am mostly using Airbnb but also Booking.</div><div><br></br></div><div>We ate our exotic food and then settled into bed to sleep or in my case watch a bit of The Diplomat on Netflix and then read.</div><div><br></br></div><div>The bed was very comfortable and I slept well. I was up at 6 am on <b>Saturday</b> morning but we didn't have to leave until at least 10.30. Our drive to Zagreb would be one of the shortest as it is only 140km from Ljubliana. We met the owner, Spela (pronounced "Shpela") just as we left and her daughter "Masha"; my namesake. Spela was lovely and told us about places to stop on the way to Zagreb. She said to have a coffee at the <a href="https://www.relaischateaux.com/us/slovenia/otocec-dolenjska-otocec">Hotel Grad Otocec </a>and so we went there.  As we left the city, we filled the tank and were relieved to see a litre cost 1.4 euros. As we continue our journey it will get even cheaper. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We were bowled over when we reached the Otocec castle. It was like something out of a fairy tale. This is it, as seen from the bridge over the River Kirka. It's now a 5 star  hotel and a far cry from where we would be staying in Zagreb. It was not open for coffee though, only opening at 14h and we couldn't wait. </div><div><br></br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhazr0bV2RIdBv0TXVobr51Xyve1jjUd4avAmgG__LOQdyeRI5hgR1VXhKVGIpx3nNIKDDviuwOYp2b0ncIMLXr1agYJcmwAxka7A7o4JrmB6NEc-Ec2I0DV9fDahMbtekeSuKcpk8FkqM--cCQzOxHEpE9ZrHntWaitjKsQUq-28NrA7drOe4/s4032/20230429_113749.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhazr0bV2RIdBv0TXVobr51Xyve1jjUd4avAmgG__LOQdyeRI5hgR1VXhKVGIpx3nNIKDDviuwOYp2b0ncIMLXr1agYJcmwAxka7A7o4JrmB6NEc-Ec2I0DV9fDahMbtekeSuKcpk8FkqM--cCQzOxHEpE9ZrHntWaitjKsQUq-28NrA7drOe4/w400-h180/20230429_113749.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqL0HaXCNl1GVP81-fezPPsaNuhgkRBTK92E0T7BvMtVEAkQBPg2rz4YBfGp1WTaQBdA0aEKDMGbX69D2dKKL8Z9gI-w5YiYVV94K53WsZrOiQ26i98TdpqZaMUHFaxbFtHuPdCSgv5K788esC7TXqYLflzhAwPkATKHs-oQE0h3EzTl1-LA4/s1600/IMG-20230429-WA0021.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqL0HaXCNl1GVP81-fezPPsaNuhgkRBTK92E0T7BvMtVEAkQBPg2rz4YBfGp1WTaQBdA0aEKDMGbX69D2dKKL8Z9gI-w5YiYVV94K53WsZrOiQ26i98TdpqZaMUHFaxbFtHuPdCSgv5K788esC7TXqYLflzhAwPkATKHs-oQE0h3EzTl1-LA4/w400-h300/IMG-20230429-WA0021.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Otocec - beautiful place</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Getting into Zagreb would be a challenge. Thankfully Spela had warned me we couldn't park in the centre and would have to leave our car in a garage further out. The owners of our accommodation told us which one and we found it quite quickly. It was about 500 metres from our accommodation but we needed a taxi for all our belongings. The place from the outside looked ghastly and I was disappointed. When booking it I  had put filters in for parking on the premises and a kitchen but the <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/hr/niva-rooms.en-gb.html?label=gen173nr-1FCA4oggI46AdIM1gEaEaIAQGYAQm4ARjIAQzYAQHoAQH4AQOIAgGoAgS4Au3CsqIGwAIB0gIkYWYxNDZjNjAtNzZlMS00Y2RkLWE4ZjUtMjcxOGViMjJhM2E02AIF4AIB&amp;sid=9e1e15fc02deb2156a15b1f47ea52760&amp;aid=304142">Niva Rooms</a> had neither.

It was warm and sunny - 22º - so no need for jumpers. From our street "Ilica", in the heart of the city, we walked to the big square Jelacic Square.

It was full of restaurants and bars and people, so lively but not as nice as the streets in Ljubliana. Zagreb had never been a place we were keen to see but it's on the way to Sofia.

Since we entered the Balkans, we have of course remembered and spoken about the terrible Balkan Wars here in the early 90's. At that cafe we did lots of research both to refresh our memories and to learn more. It is impossible to summarise them here but we all know just how terrible they were. They led to the complete split of former Yugoslavia into all the countries that are now independent. Both Eladio and I had learned at school that this was Yugoslavia, so no wonder, it takes a bit of time to place all the new independent former Yugoslave countries not only on a map but in our heads. This trip is helping.
