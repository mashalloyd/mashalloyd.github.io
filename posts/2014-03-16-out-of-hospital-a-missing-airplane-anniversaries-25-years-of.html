<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Well what a
week it has been, memorable in many ways on the news front.  We have had marvelous weather and spring is
on the way. So let me start.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">This time last
week Eladio was in hospital.  Thankfully
it all turned out to be a storm in a teacup and on Monday he was
discharged.  They made him wear a halter
(a device worn to measure your blood pressure for 24 hours) as the doctors
suspected his feeling faint was possibly because of a valve in his heart.  This worried us quite a lot but the final
diagnosis was that he has a clean bill of health and that he probably felt
faint as he had been standing reading the newspaper for an hour before sitting
down to breakfast.  Now he has breakfast
as soon as he is in the kitchen and reads the paper sitting down!<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The week’s
news has been dominated by the story of a missing Boing 777 belonging to
Malaysia Airlines.  Last Saturday it took
off for Beijing with 237 people onboard and went missing shortly afterwards.  There has been no sign of the plane since and
the signals are now turning to a high jacking attempt which probably ended in
the plane crashing into the sea.  It is a
very mysterious story and I have been following the news daily.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Tuesday 11<sup>th</sup>
March was the <a href="http://www.thelocal.es/20140311/the-fear-is-always-with-you">10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Madrid train bombings</a>, the
deadliest terrorist attack in Spanish history. 
For people in Spain this is like our 9<sup>th</sup> September.  The bombs on 4 packed commuter trains heading
for the Madrid Atocha station killed 191 people and wounded about 2,000.  It is something none of us can ever forget
and each and every one of us remembers where we were and what we were doing
when it happened.  I was in Segovia with
Anne N and the other members of the Nokia marketing team.  We had gone there for a farewell event.  I was with Anne when it happened and it was
thanks to her Mother we found out, who had called her from Finland to see if
she was alright.  That is a day I will
never forget.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Tuesday 11<sup>th</sup>
March was also the 3<sup>rd</sup> annivesary of the </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-font-kerning: 18.0pt;">Fukushima nuclear disaster, tsunami and earthquake
disaster which killed some 16 thousand people in Japan.  That is a day that will go down in history as
one of the worst natural disasters ever to happen. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-font-kerning: 18.0pt;">That day I got a phone call from my new (dotted line) Finnish boss Tatu.  It was funny for me to receive a phone call
from a number beginning with 358.  I
immediately recognised the number as coming from Finland, due to the many years
I worked for Nokia.  I look forward to
meeting him and my new team members at the beginning of April in Stockholm.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-font-kerning: 18.0pt;">On Tuesday too I had lunch with a colleague, “A” who has just lost her
job as the communications director with a well-known mobile phone
manufacturer.  We had lunch at the only
English restaurant I know of in Madrid, <a href="http://bristolbar.es/">The Bristol Bar</a>.  Here we devoured a wonderful plate of fish
and chips, followed by an enormous portion of fruit crumble.  There was a lot of advice I could give to “A”
about finding a new job as I have been through the experience twice.  We also had a story in common she wished to
discuss with me.  The story was not
pleasant and was about a nasty person called Carlos L who had bullied me
terribly whilst at Nokia and then went on to bully her too at the mobile phone
company they both worked for.  The
conversation brought back some bad memories but at least we could commiserate
together.  I wish her lots of luck and
trust she will find another job soon.  My
advice to her was to take her job hunting as seriously as if it were a work
project and to give herself a year.  Hopefully
it will take a lot less. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">On Wednesday I had a conference call with all the “communicators” in our
mother company. When the Swedes or Finns pronounce local names, if I don’t know
the people, I can’t understand who they are talking about. Thankfully I was
later sent a power point with the new organisation chart and now know who is
doing what.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It is amazing to see big communication
teams structures in some countries with fewer customers than Yoigo when I am a
one woman show doing communication here in Spain.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I really think if you are organised and

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-font-kerning: 18.0pt;">Wednesday was the <a href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/technology/internet/article4031815.ece">25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the internet</a>.  I can hardly imagine life today without if

revolutionary, at least in attitude and style of living, very popular
Argentinian Pope.  I am a great fan of
his but as I wrote to my own parish priest recently, Brandon J, I very much
doubt he will make a difference where it matters: women being admitted to the
priesthood, priests being allowed to marry, contraception, etc, etc.  In any case on Wednesday Pope Francis was big
news.  He is by far the most popular Pope
ever and that is good for the Catholic Church, whether you like it or not.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">As I walk on my own on the second walk of the day (Eladio comes once with
the dogs, mainly in the mornings), I enjoy listening to music on Spotify.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I have come to realise that much of the music
on my lists is music I listened to in the 70s and 80s and it was music my
brother George also liked or played, so I have thought much about him during my
walks this week.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">He is dead, that is a terrible
fact, but he lives on in my heart.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">When
I listen to Carole King particularly I remember him playing “Tapestry” on the
piano.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Oh George, how terrible that you

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-font-kerning: 18.0pt;">On Friday, when I particularly enjoy my breakfast after a fasting day, I
read that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/03/14/tony-benn-dead_n_4961964.html">Tony Benn died </a>aged 88. 
Today’s generation won’t know who he is but I remember him clearly from
when I was a teenager.  A difficult man
to describe, he was a sort of left wing national treasure.  He served under Harold Wilson and was possibly
one of the most radical Labour politicians in English history, after Michael
Foot.  He is most known perhaps for
giving up his hereditary peerage but I remember him particularly for backing
the miners’ strike in 1985 and being a huge annoyance to Margaret Thatcher.  He will be remembered also for his amazing
rhetoric, for constantly smoking a pipe, but perhaps I remember him most for
his incredible ability to drink copious amounts of tea. He claimed once that he
drank one pint of tea per hour.  He must
have had a huge bladder I’m sure. Neither his smoking nor his tea drinking seem
to have hindered his health in old age lucky him.  RIP Tony Benn.  My parents never liked you but I secretly
admired you as I imagine many people did.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">On Friday too, there was news from Suzy from London.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Missing both my girls, it was lovely to talk
to her two or three times this week.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">On
Friday she was going to see a flat Gabor had liked and it was being kept on
hold for them if she liked it too.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
flat is in </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_Water" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Canada Water </a><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">(Southeast London) in the Docklands area which is
apparently becoming quite a genteel area – not like in the past.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It is on the Jubilee Line and only 4 stops
from Waterloo near where she works at the Oxo building.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">As soon as Suzy saw it she loved it and they
will be moving in next Saturday.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Nothing
will be stopping them this time, I hope.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">They will be sharing with 3 other people (two Italian boys and one
Spanish girl).</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The flat looks lovely,
new, refurbished and has all the mod cons.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Their room has private access to a garden, there is wifi, the bills are
all included and most importantly a cleaner is too.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This is a photo of the house from the outside.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I am so happy for Suzy and Gabor.</span></div>

again.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Dinner yesterday night was once
again at the English restaurant, the Bristol Bar and it was with our friends
Pedro and Ludy; Pedro being the famous Spanish cyclist and TV commentator Pedro
Delgado.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Eladio thought the place was a

trimmings.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It certainly wasn’t the best
I’ve ever had but as I love that dish so much I wasn’t complaining. It was
great to see our friends again and we chatted a lot that night about TVE which
Pedro knows very well and where Olivia works.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">

but I read about the news yesterday.  The
photo often called “the kiss” is so famous you will recognise it immediately.  I was interested to read he was changing
trains on his way to meet his girlfriend when he heard Japan had
surrendered.  When he got out of the
subway he was so happy and when he saw the nurse standing there he just went over
and kissed her.  The nurse was Edith
Shain who worked in a hospital nearby and who died in 2010. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

Crimea for the population to vote whether they want to belong to Russia or
remain in the Ukraine.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This issue, more

<a href="http://metro.co.uk/2014/03/16/revealed-the-101-best-places-to-live-in-britain-4604660/">best place to live in England</a>.  At lunch
just as my Father was asking me once again what Facebook and Twitter were, I
read an article posted by a school friend, Geraldine, on her “wall” (difficult
to explain what that is to my Father). 
She had posted a story from the Sunday Times which was publishing the
results of a survey on the best places to live in England.  I was very interested to know the winner and
very full of praise when I heard it was my beloved Skipton, also known as “the
gateway to the Dales”.  I would also have
been happy had the best place been voted Harrogate, Ilkley, York or even
Gargrave, all wonderful towns in ”God’s own country” Yorkshire. I was also
pleased to read that another town I love in England, Falmouth in Cornwall, came
fourth. <o:p></o:p></span></div>
