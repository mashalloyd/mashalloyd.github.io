February and it’s my birthday.  I am 58
today, just 2 years away from the dreaded 60 milestone.  Who would believe it?  Certainly not me!  So far it has been wonderful and it is only

it later and start off from where I left off last Sunday.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

Oli went sales shopping and bought me a lovely grey cardigan from Oysho.  How I would have loved to go with her, but as
you know I am still immobile due to the accident and operation on my
ankle.  Suzy meanwhile was continuing her
visit to Nottingham.  I was very pleased
to hear that she visited the “<a href="http://triptojerusalem.com/the-pub/">Ye Olde trip to Jerusalem</a>” which is supposedly
the oldest pub in England and an old haunt of ours when I was at Nottingham
University. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">That afternoon
I binge watched the now semi new Forsyte Saga TV series.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">When we watched the 1967 series at home in
England we had to content ourselves with watching one episode a week for months
and months. These days you can watch various seasons of nearly any series you
want all in one go.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">How things have

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Monday was
spent like nearly every day since my accident: breakfast in bed (the biggest
advantage of being immobile), a very careful shower, working from my pc in my
new bed come office and later watching TV series.  For my lovely daughter Suzy, however Monday
turned out to be a red letter day.  She
didn’t know the expression and I explained that it meant a day of “special
significance”. What was significant for her that day was that she landed the
interim job she had applied for whilst waiting for her registry number as a UK
qualified dietitian to come through with the HCPC (health and care professions
council).  She will be working for
Decathlon, the French sports retailer – the biggest of its kind in the world –
at the only store in London which is very near where she lives in Surrey Quays.
That will keep her busy, earning money and get her out of the house.  I wish her lots of luck and hope she enjoys
the job. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">On Tuesday I
was feeling down about being immobile and trapped.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The prospects were not good either as I had
been told I would be in a cast for 2 or 3 months and probably not walking
properly until another 6.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">That day I
surfed the web a lot about the recovery length and got rather depressed in the
process.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Then my friend Jackie told me
to be more positive and to look up how to speed the process up.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I did just what she said and one of the
things I found out was the importance of my diet. I knew I had to be on a high
fiber diet but apparently the body needs a higher intake of calories than
normal for the bones to mend.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">That
doesn’t mean eating more, but eating more carefully.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It’s amazing how my body has craved for fruit
and veg ever since the accident as if it knew what I should be eating to
recover.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Of course I need a lot of
calcium too which I am having via milk and lots of veg but at the same time I
am steering clear of carbohydrates and sugary stuff as I don’t want to put on
weight whilst I cannot do my normal exercise.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Life continued
of course on Tuesday and from my small but connected world in my bedroom I was
amazed to read that Harper Lee, the reclusive American octogenarian author of
the literary gem “To Killl a Mockingbird” (Pulitzer Prize) of which 30 million
books have been printed since it was published in 1960 – made even more famous
by the film with Gregory Peck – was to <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-31118355">publish its sequel</a>.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Since writing
To Kill a Mockingbird (a novel of racism in Alabama in the 30’s as seen through
the eyes of a 10 year old tomboy called Scout and of how her lawyer Father
Atticus defends a black man wrongly accused of raping a white woman) she never
published another novel.  However it
turns out that the manuscript for her first novel was found by a friend
recently.  This first novel is about
Scout as an adult and some of her memories as a child about her Father’s law
case.  At the time her publisher wrote
back to advise her to write another novel this time about Scout as a child and
the law case.  And this is exactly what
she did.  When her friend found the
manuscript recently and showed it to her, Harper Lee was very surprised it had
survived and sent it to close friends to get their opinion.  They advised her to publish it and the rest
is history now or will be when 1 million copies will be printed in the US
shortly.  I always loved her book, as did
my Mother.  I think it was one of her
favourites.  So, I for one am avidly
forward to reading the sequel which, as I say, funnily enough was written
before To Kill a Mockingbird.  The new
novel is called Go Set a Watchman.  Isn’t
that an extraordinary story?<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">A much worse
story hit the news that day too.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">IS –
those savage and brutal jihadists, issued a ghastly </span><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2938299/One-sickening-acts-committed-film-Carefully-edited-highly-choreographed-footage-ISIS-knows-horrify-West-entice-jihadists-cause.html" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">video showing how they burned alive</a><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> the captive Jordanian pilot, Kasasbeh in a cage.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The release of the video came days after the
beheading of a second Japanese hostage within a week. Isis had vowed to kill
them unless the Jordanian government handed over Iraqui Jihadist and “would-be
suicide bomber” Sajida al-Rishawi both on death row in Jordan.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The deal collapsed when IS did not show proof
of the pilot being alive.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I have not

crutches bearing weight on my leg.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I

</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I can now begin to envisage myself at the beginning of March in

but the doctor said maybe I could if very little walking is entailed.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">So please keep your fingers crossed. On the

walks, make it to Barcelona for the MWC, join the European team I belong to in
their next meeting in Finland at the beginning of March and spend the weekend
before with Anne in Salo, go to Montrondo, go to the snow in the mountains
outside Madrid, have my nails done, go shopping with Oli, go see Suzy in
London, a trip to Yorkshire and tea at Betty’s, go for a drive in my new car
which will be ready for picking up in Feb, Visit Gael, Juan and Cristina’s
newly born baby boy, go and see Oli’s newsroom and meet her lovely colleagues
who sent me a present and fantastic get well card, shop at Naranjas de la China
where Ketchum ordered the super fruit and flower hamper they sent to me, shop

etceteras. </span><br></br>

back in my bed come office with a new positive mind set, up came Eladio bearing
a parcel. I couldn’t believe it. What another parcel?  I have received so many presents, visits,
good wishes I feel overwhelmed.  The
parcel was from one of my dearest readers, a person I have known since I was a
child in Yorkshire and person I am coming to love more as the years pass.  Dearest Jackie had sent me a box of Yorkshire
goodies: sweets, biscuits and tea for my birthday.  This is me delighted with Jackie’s parcel.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The big
international news on Wednesday was of course the horrific story of the Taiwan

shocking.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I’m sure you have seen how the
plane comes over a road with lots of cars and just manages to avoid them
swerving into the Keelung River.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">There
have been quite a few awful crashes recently in this part of the world and I,
for one, would be very hesitant to buy a ticket to fly with Trans Air or
Malaysian airlines.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I’m sure you would

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">But the news
that made most impact on me on Wednesday and the following days was of the snow
in our beloved Montrondo.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">There have
been tremendous snow falls in most of the north of Spain; some of them quite
historic, but in Montrondo it snowed this week more than it has for some 40 or
50 years.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">If you don’t believe me, just
look at this photo of one of the 15 or so villagers, José Antonio, as he shovels away
the snow to make some sort of path.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Literally he is up to his neck in snow.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">That
is a lot more snow than you would even find in Lapland or northern Sweden right
now.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The villagers
are snow trapped in Montrondo.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Salo, who
lives there, told me the snow plough managed to clear the road from nearby
Murias but that there was so much on either side of the road it was difficult
to pass.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">That meant the bread vans from
Senra or Murias couldn’t make the delivery.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">So the local hero, Javier, the youngest villager, put on his snow shoes
and made it down to Murias where every day this week he has bought bread and
taken it back in his ruck sack to be delivered to each and every neighbour in
Montrondo.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">He really is the local hero.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I love seeing his photos on the Montrondo
group page in Facebook. If it wasn’t for my foot we would have gone there in a
shot this weekend.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I am just hoping the
snow stays until my foot gets better and I can witness with my own eyes this
historical snow fall in “our” village.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I must say I
woke up feeling a lot more comfortable without the cast on Thursday
morning.  Olivia was off at the crack of
dawn to do a report on the snow in a village called La Hiruela about 90 odd km
from Madrid.  On the way they were
trapped in the snow and had to be helped. 
Even the snow plough itself was trapped. 
I’m not quite sure how they got out but they had quite an adventure. This
is a photo of their car being pushed in the snow.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

with the Spanish Cope radio at 9 am about the company’s performance and the

important. I felt very frustrated not to be by his side but had organized everything

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Friday I
was happy to have an email from my oldest best friend, Amanda.  We went to school together and have been
friends since we were 10 years old.  It
was great to get her news. I replied immediately and told her lots of things I
would never dare put here as you can possibly imagine.  Whilst looking out for good TV series to
watch whilst I’m immobile, a few people had recommended a series called “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Tango_in_Halifax">Last Tango in Halifax</a>”.  I wasn’t sure it was
my cup of tea until Amanda recommended it in her emails.  She knows my taste, so I went for it and
downloaded the first 2 episodes.  I have
devoured them but unfortunately the quality of the other episodes is not too
good so I decided to order the box set of the 3 series from Amazon and can’t
wait for it to arrive next week.  Last
Tango in Halifax is a great British TV series supposedly set in Yorkshire –
Skipton, Harrogate and Halifax (although disappointingly the Harrogate scenes
are shot in Lancashire) about two families. 
The main plot is how the two </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">septuagenarian</span>
grandmother and grandfather of the respective families meet up after 60 years
when they had once been sweethearts.  It’s
a mixture of drama and comedy in the best British way, so I’m devouring it and
loving the Yorkshire settings and accents and the portrayal of modern day life
in Yorkshire. <o:p></o:p></div>

<span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">On
Friday too I got some photos of Pippa – the miniature smooth haired chocolate
coloured dachshund who will soon be part of our family – end of Feb.</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">They are not very good photos but the best I
have.</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The breeder Antonio, to whom I
spoke on Friday, obviously knows lots about these dogs but is not a good
photographer.</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I was happy to hear that
Pippa has a lovely disposition.</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We can’t
wait to see her and hold her in our arms. Waiting for you little Pippa with all
the love in the world.</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></div>

<span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Believe
it or not, on Friday, Eladio had insisted on taking me out for dinner, to get
me out of my pyjamas and out of bed.</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">He
was right I suppose but it was a big effort.</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">My leg no longer hurts so it sort of made sense but it did feel strange
dressing up and putting makeup on.</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We
borrowed my Father’s wheel chair for the occasion and I felt very funny being
wheeled down the street and into the restaurant.</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Oli and Miguel were waiting for us when we
arrived.</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I felt a bit self-conscious in a
wheel chair but soon forgot I was in one and enjoyed the dinner
enormously.</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We went to </span><a href="http://www.zurito.com/" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Zurito</a><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> in Pozuelo
which serves lovely food. </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">That night, I
broke my diet but who cares? Miguel took a lovely photo of Eladio which Oli
posted on FB adding that we were still in love “35 years later” which some people
interpreted as our anniversary.</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It wasn’t
though. For the record we have been together since the summer of 1980 but got
married in 1983.</span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">What is true is that we
are still in love and will always be.</span></div>

day started with a lovely birthday breakfast as all our family birthdays do.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The photo illustrating this post is of me
with the presents, a wonderful fruit and flower hamper from Olivia and Miguel
(Naranjas de la China) and the black Michael Kors bag I wanted from Eladio and
my Father. </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Miguel was using his new
