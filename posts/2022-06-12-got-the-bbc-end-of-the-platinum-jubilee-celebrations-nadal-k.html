I can't complain or shouldn't at least. I don't have a perfect life but it's as good as it gets. </div><p></p><p style="text-align: justify;">One thing missing from my life as a "Brit abroad" was the good old BBC. Thus I missed out on a lot of the Platinum Jubilee Celebrations. An old pupil of my father, Michael, who lives in France, sorted that for me last Sunday when he suggested I sign up for Express VPN. I had been thinking about it for a while and upon his recommendation I downloaded it and paid for one year. I did so on my iPad and on my Samsung Galaxy phone. It worked but is not perfect as the BBC often detects that the VPN is not in England and adds cookies and it crashes while watching. The only way round that would be to use someone's Apple ID who lives in England and get the iPlayer app. As an iPad owner in Spain I only get directed to the Spanish Apple store when downloading apps and to get the iPlayer I would need a UK Apple ID. But that is maybe a lot to ask of a friend. I don't know. I'm still thinking about it. For the meanwhile though now I have access not only to the BBC but also ITV and Channel 5, albeit sometimes interrupted. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBqOYRotK0jaEdGjMpfXjjm1C6H0mmMHyDy7qotKgiT4I55UJ8LE4qAJj8ThrG4bbezyui5rUqWqOodpKO2NShXpOXiV2ECzgSn1kW6KVKxk_Nyac45-gVD2t3xZaGCIsEexirv8qJ2xXWQry_qRmQP0hBU-5ECxbdaaasNDhDii2ogb3Ofno/s4032/BBC%20on%20my%20iPad.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBqOYRotK0jaEdGjMpfXjjm1C6H0mmMHyDy7qotKgiT4I55UJ8LE4qAJj8ThrG4bbezyui5rUqWqOodpKO2NShXpOXiV2ECzgSn1kW6KVKxk_Nyac45-gVD2t3xZaGCIsEexirv8qJ2xXWQry_qRmQP0hBU-5ECxbdaaasNDhDii2ogb3Ofno/w400-h180/BBC%20on%20my%20iPad.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>I've finally got access to the BBC in Spain although illicitly </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">That day then I caught up with some of the Jubilee content I had missed such as the Platinum Party at Buckingham Palace on Saturday night. It was splendid but I am no great fan of rock so only really appreciated Queen but then again Queen is not the same without Freddy Mercury is it. The best part and the part we shall never forget was the clip of Paddington Bear having tea with Her Majesty at Buckingham Palace. What a splendid bit of British humour and TV at its very, very best. I also watched the documentary called "Elizabeth: The Unseen Queen"  - the story of her life in picture and in film, most of which came from her own private collection. Marvelous. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Queen was also largely unseen at the Jubilee celebrations owing to her age mostly but she made a surprise appearance on the balcony of the palace on Sunday afternoon after a huge pageant on the streets of London. It was to close the Jubilee and to thank everyone. She appeared with the closest royals, Prince Charles and Camilla, Prince William, Kate and their 3 children including Prince George. That represented 4 generations and 4 generations of monarch and future monarchs. There was little seen of the Sussexes that day or any day and as to Prince Andrew, he conveniently had Covid. Here is our lovely Queen dressed in emerald green who had traveled from Windsor Castle to the Palace for the surprise appearance which delighted crowds and royal fans.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLDJ5aW5zVYuE9SNxn3diVTFZudHcdtMCIL2vZCyo2QF7fR7dzzPBn3M3XUp0VBRB30LHlCQIfzjXNhTZ2O8fJyJbV856lrnytCmJrtxwPAgcIv-JZatg2D_ITh8DaiYzPD_sAsaQaGq5JFGtxuSQrlCu82uFE7otZ0QWkEZXYWRStEP-cAWk/s1076/Queen%20in%20green%20on%20balcony%20at%20BP.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="229" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLDJ5aW5zVYuE9SNxn3diVTFZudHcdtMCIL2vZCyo2QF7fR7dzzPBn3M3XUp0VBRB30LHlCQIfzjXNhTZ2O8fJyJbV856lrnytCmJrtxwPAgcIv-JZatg2D_ITh8DaiYzPD_sAsaQaGq5JFGtxuSQrlCu82uFE7otZ0QWkEZXYWRStEP-cAWk/w400-h229/Queen%20in%20green%20on%20balcony%20at%20BP.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Queen in a surprise appearance at BP on Sunday night to close the celebrations of her Platinum Jubilee</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, her cousins,  the King of Spain and Norway's Crown Prince Haakon were in Paris at Roland Garros, the site of the French Open. They were there to watch the King of tennis, Rafa Nadal of Spain and his Norwegian pupil Casper Ruud at his tennis academy in Mallorca, play the final. It was the first time in history a Norwegian tennis player took part in a Grand Slam final. For the Spaniard,  it was his 30th Grand Slam final and his 17th  Paris Open.  He first won in 2005 aged just 19 and he won yesterday aged 36. He now has 14 French Cups and 22 Grand Slam wins. That makes him the GOAT (greatest of all times) in men's singles tennis. Let's not forget that Steffi Graf also has 22 Grand Slam titles. However, no one comes close to him in Paris. No one has ever won a grand slam 14 times. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpoukeOxz2v2BSKiKg_VlsIZG-HM_vkKSZ9IFwKgX1i0H3yNKPM4g7pB4eYpPfI6yG3CS1AjRS5iWdcrbIL-G70Hyisva9YTLsaZ_HBFmsW7eCBpGYBgtUXKlGhtd4stEkwd9_pHnBQbndSAh2R-0R6lxFdQKydYtix7AV1gJJ99N_EShH02g/s1080/Nadal%20figures.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="383" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpoukeOxz2v2BSKiKg_VlsIZG-HM_vkKSZ9IFwKgX1i0H3yNKPM4g7pB4eYpPfI6yG3CS1AjRS5iWdcrbIL-G70Hyisva9YTLsaZ_HBFmsW7eCBpGYBgtUXKlGhtd4stEkwd9_pHnBQbndSAh2R-0R6lxFdQKydYtix7AV1gJJ99N_EShH02g/w400-h383/Nadal%20figures.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The figures that show Nadal is the G.O.A.T in men's tennis</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The twitter handle of Roland Garros very fittingly called him "Rafa Garros".</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsegG0WYSLWshT9wCruhCtjslOJZVTDjg9-CSOSHwoV7Shu45m7wiPtaeDn9CGphB8aJV_rXN7GPLNsap-UY_JbW677iVXR-VqjlrY2jzi42XWbKujMyxV9TihhGqRLg1mwr0TjhcN1xkYCFEjwddcQ-cQSR61_4r-Tmvlt92JV7NLLhi290I/s1914/Rafa%20Garros.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjsegG0WYSLWshT9wCruhCtjslOJZVTDjg9-CSOSHwoV7Shu45m7wiPtaeDn9CGphB8aJV_rXN7GPLNsap-UY_JbW677iVXR-VqjlrY2jzi42XWbKujMyxV9TihhGqRLg1mwr0TjhcN1xkYCFEjwddcQ-cQSR61_4r-Tmvlt92JV7NLLhi290I/w223-h400/Rafa%20Garros.jpg" width="223"></img></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">He broke so many records last Sunday and Spain could not have a greater ambassador for sport. But and it's a big but, Rafa Nadal has an incurable injury on his foot - necrosis of a bone - and he had to be injected for the tournament meaning he felt completely numb in his foot. So, how long can he carry on for? It depends on his foot of course. For me, it would be the perfect time to retire, on such a high. However, he still loves the game and wants to continue if he is physically able to. Thus, as with the Queen, I also say "long may he reign". </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Our own Sunday was also a family day when we were all reunited. I went for a walk with Pippa on my own while Eladio washed the Volvo and mowed the smaller lawns. I had my headphones on and as it was Sunday I played my British hymns list. That had me thinking of my father's memorial service just one month ago; how marvelous it was and how I am so grateful to all those who made it possible. I can't stop thinking about it. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I came home to make our lunch as Oli and Juliet were coming - Miguel went to his mother's with Elliot. With the help of Lucy and Suzy I made a family favourite; potato salad. The kitchen was busy as we had 6 guests that day - the Chinese family and  two young American girls, Emily and Sarah. Emily is actually from Puerto Rico so that day we had 6 nationalities in the house- The United Nations hahahaha.  Eladio and I  had our mid morning coffee talking to Jayzay and Yinzi and spoke about China and how it is such an enigma to the west. This young couple with two kids (they say they are unique vs a vs the one child policy) are very very critical of the Chinese communist regime. They told us that many, many people are but just can't speak out in public. I asked them about their parents and grandparents and what life was like for them during the terrible "cultural revolution". Our conversation was fascinating. As Airbnb hosts, I have to say it's not just about the money to help run our big house, it's also about meeting interesting people from all over the world.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As there are so many eating places in the house and garden, there were plenty for everyone to choose from. We had ours on the kitchen patio which is really our domain. The girls and Juliet then retired to the shady part of the pool while Eladio and I went up to have our siesta. Before falling asleep I watched a bit of "Elizabeth: The Unseen Queen and later went down to join the girls. I had to catch Suzy on camera with Juliet who turned 9 months old last week. She really is the loveliest baby in the world who  hardly ever cries. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgquaqP45nD0OUjvGrfnEE5cY6DoYrWj3HxR8uwYy7cY4QOIuNBsRdvO62yzFIfc6VStBqkh9pnIUuaO9EnWmFZTP281na47sdyi-LZTb4EvxUWn8VbukAtq0lv9qT43AXnGsFZq6zebHsuxDGMX9Bd3zInHjd4YL1mfiw271PDtUxtB-5ZlUQ/s3278/Suzy%20and%20Juliet.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgquaqP45nD0OUjvGrfnEE5cY6DoYrWj3HxR8uwYy7cY4QOIuNBsRdvO62yzFIfc6VStBqkh9pnIUuaO9EnWmFZTP281na47sdyi-LZTb4EvxUWn8VbukAtq0lv9qT43AXnGsFZq6zebHsuxDGMX9Bd3zInHjd4YL1mfiw271PDtUxtB-5ZlUQ/w215-h400/Suzy%20and%20Juliet.jpg" width="215"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Suzy and Juliet chilling out on the grass by the pool last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Oli left around 6.30 and so did Suzy but she was back for dinner.  It had been the perfect day. There was a low point though and that was to hear from Lucy, my neighbour in Santa Pola, who cleans the apartment, that this weekend's guests had been complete pigs and left the place the worst she had ever seen.

She must have felt very happy and content that night as so she should, God bless her.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Monday</b> came. On the personal side, it was one month since my father's Memorial Service at Bradford Cathedral. If you didn't watch it, you can see it on my YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPx7pWNIndc&amp;list=UUPoj8J8VR2tq_xJXsPnpn-w&amp;index=7">here</a>. I did him proud in organising the best send off possible for a wonderful father, teacher, polyglot and WW2 Royal Navy veteran officer. None of it would have been possible without the help of many who I would like to thank in public.  I hope I don't miss out on anyone. They are the Acting Dean of Bradford Cathedral, Revd. Paul Maybury, the Headmaster of Bradford Grammar School, Simon Hinchcliffe, Emma Clayton of the Telegraph and Argus, Cllr. Joanne Dodds, the Champion of the Armed Forces in Bradford, Helen Johnston, the Policy Officer, the British Royal Legion, The Royal Navy,  Chaplain of the Royal Navy, Revd. Chris Buckley, the Deputy Lord Lieutenant, David Pearson and Revd Barrie Scott, my father's old pupil who took part in the service and helped me put it together. I would especially like to thank the 12 who attended but above all John Asquith for his magnificent speech and for attending all three events. Thanks too to my father's old colleagues, Tony Kingham and Ian Stoney. I am grateful to  the Leonard-Myers family  as well.  I consider them  my family in England although they are not my blood relations. Bless them, they were with us throughout.  And of course I want to thank my wonderful family for being there and supporting me and for how well my daughters Olivia and Suzy sang for their grandfather. He would be proud of them of them. I know. So thank you all again and thanks  to all of you who watched the service online. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">On Monday morning Suzy would be leaving again. She is always leaving and then coming back thankfully. She has to find her place in this world and I only wish good things for her. Here she is leaving on Monday for Santa Pola again.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoDfMdhRTCv3-T5q_WDyLuj_ssa2c1jRpqhoZTlA7IiQ-Wy4YCWeuQWtLywRPXD4aEJLJHJVuypZ7q6GgQo72C-9tb36ArQCcQAG4hqqI46CJSuwXMJbp0h-8C8KHK-Z9L-TnFCd91SsspEVZsCFZdsay5mEfNskfwF68gQjYccHd-zQ3pF30/s2016/Suzy%20leaving%206th%20June.jpeg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoDfMdhRTCv3-T5q_WDyLuj_ssa2c1jRpqhoZTlA7IiQ-Wy4YCWeuQWtLywRPXD4aEJLJHJVuypZ7q6GgQo72C-9tb36ArQCcQAG4hqqI46CJSuwXMJbp0h-8C8KHK-Z9L-TnFCd91SsspEVZsCFZdsay5mEfNskfwF68gQjYccHd-zQ3pF30/w180-h400/Suzy%20leaving%206th%20June.jpeg" width="180"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Suzy leaving again on Monday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">When she left we both went to our hairdresser, Conchi, for a well needed cut and root treatment in my case, hahahahaha. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile in England, Boris Johnson who needs no introduction, was facing the trial of his premiership. He was facing a vote of no confidence after 54 Tory MPs had submitted a letter calling for his resignation. He needed 180 of his more 359 fellow MPs to vote against him for him to resign. In the end 148 voted against and 211 for him. He came out of it the wounded victor yet vows to carry on. It is a fact that his predecessors, Margaret Thatcher and Teresa May came out better from their votes of confidence yet went on to resign. He has to go but he won't until he is dragged out of Downing Street. He is unfit for the job and that is a fact. If it hadn't just been his own party members who voted that day and it had been the public, I think he may have lost. Did you see how he was booed when he arrived at the Platinum Jubilee Thanksgiving Service at St. Paul?</div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br></br></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Oh the Platinum Jubilee. Thanks to my father's ex pupil, Michael, now that I had the BBC, I was able to catch up on the events and spent 90 minutes watching a summary programme that afternoon from the comfort of the bench outside our kitchen. I enjoyed every blessed minute of it. The Brits do pomp so well but as the commentator said, "not pompously".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Eladio joined me for part of it and was impressed too. But he had work to do. He washed both cars and mowed the two smaller lawns. I did not do much else I am ashamed to say.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Tuesday</b> came and the news was full of the result of the Confidence Vote. Oli, my daughter was asked at the last moment to do a piece in the studio on what the reaction of the UK papers was. She asked me for help and I, in turn, asked my father's ex pupil, Michael, who is something of an expert on UK politics. She had to choose 3 front pages and went for The Times (a wounded victor) The Mirror (Party's over Boris) and The Daily Star (Carry on Pinocchio). </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiQ_cfrjWFGjNiFqij28ho6OFKSB2BtYS2vTgWQAnOE8YJvSGEQGcsmPKRNS9jImAGVNX0vfQ1SY3fhYjoDeS5uaKI11_ZSd5ueuNsWF1EI7gmZe-GmEurYUvWeCBFbCUlEF4y7NXJjQFUAvctWtppCisIayt_IRjUcL1QFh_YBreTrs4zv8d4/s1070/Screenshot_20220607-081958_Guardian.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="256" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiQ_cfrjWFGjNiFqij28ho6OFKSB2BtYS2vTgWQAnOE8YJvSGEQGcsmPKRNS9jImAGVNX0vfQ1SY3fhYjoDeS5uaKI11_ZSd5ueuNsWF1EI7gmZe-GmEurYUvWeCBFbCUlEF4y7NXJjQFUAvctWtppCisIayt_IRjUcL1QFh_YBreTrs4zv8d4/w400-h256/Screenshot_20220607-081958_Guardian.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Some of Tuesday's front pages in the UK papers</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Both Michael who switched his VPN to Madrid, watched her live.

I can't believe the British government is doing this. I know someone who works in the Home Office. He explained that the policy was to deter immigrants from coming to England which I heartily disagree with.   For Iranians, Afghans, Syrians, etc, being sent to Rwanda must be nearly as awful as staying in their own countries. This reminds me of Nazism when Hitler wanted to send the Jews to Madasgacar. My mother who arrived in England as an immigrant just after WW2 would have been appalled. Even then it wasn't easy for people like her. In order to get a residency permit she had to work as a cleaner for 2 years! That is awful too but better than being sent to Rwanda. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Tuesday 7th would have been her birthday. I only wish she could have seen Oli on TV this week,  see the girls now and of course our grandchildren. She left us on 1st October 1999 and was reunited with my father on 5th May last. Oh, how I miss them. I no longer have my father to say "today would have been Mummy's birthday" so I kept it to myself but thought about her quietly. </div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Here are two photos to mark the day. The black and white one is of her aged 18 in Bulgaria. That photo has wording on it in French which I can't decipher. I have an inkling it was the one she used in Germany during the war to forge papers to leave Berlin for Vienna before the Red Army came.  She did so with her brother Nicky on an old Germany typewriter at the Gestapo headquarters while the  latter were literally fleeing. She always told me the photo was one her younger brother kept with him, telling people it was his girlfriend. It's a good job he had it otherwise there would have been no escape papers for her. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEishfSlbjJx-ixx-ABaI4iKLkNzVFfBTGX38YraB6Bf4A80A1aO-ocRugOo6HtEXp7A2I0ZHWs2uON00iXhEO5-1WJGDMNACCrWqEliMgQU-Vl2zqQUAazzY884iy248qBuSlfq95jCVXgLwx6H_IIEs4H_9vcs0C1ZXAgxZ0MwrAMhwvR5tM4/s2065/My%20mother%20aged%2018.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEishfSlbjJx-ixx-ABaI4iKLkNzVFfBTGX38YraB6Bf4A80A1aO-ocRugOo6HtEXp7A2I0ZHWs2uON00iXhEO5-1WJGDMNACCrWqEliMgQU-Vl2zqQUAazzY884iy248qBuSlfq95jCVXgLwx6H_IIEs4H_9vcs0C1ZXAgxZ0MwrAMhwvR5tM4/s320/My%20mother%20aged%2018.jpg" width="204"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My mother aged 18</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">The other  one is with George and I was taken at the University of East Anglia during the famous Norwich Russian Courses in the early to mid 70's.

We are not often romantic but my goodness that day just as we were reaching El Corte Inglés department store to pick up Eladio's new suit, he told me I was his universe. He is mine of course but what a beautiful way to say he loved me. Later that night he told me he had been inspired by a <a href="https://www.bonjourpoesie.fr/lesgrandsclassiques/poemes/victor_hugo/quand_nous_habitions_tous_ensemble?fbclid=IwAR036XfaxdPSrajG4LoiqYpwOfwiFNF1-Os-FrRpihP9ObKTiC5ZwASD1yM#:~:text=Nous%20revenions%2C%20coeurs%20pleins%20de,parlant%20des%20splendeurs%20du%20ciel.&amp;text=Comme%20l&#x27;abeille%20fait%20son%20miel.&amp;text=Conune%20l&#x27;ombre%20et%20comme%20le%20vent%20!">poem by Victor Hugo</a> ( Quand nous habitions ensemble) which he recited to me in French . His memory for poems is daunting but in French even more so don't you think? One of the things I admire most in my husband is his just how cultured he is. Not many husbands or lovers would be inspired by a poem by Victor Hugo in French if they are not French. What a good education he had. Mine pales in comparison.  PS The poem is about paternal love but there is nothing paternal about my husband's love for me. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">If French is synonymous with chic, that is just what my husband looked when he tried on the Calvin Klein suit we had bought for an upcoming wedding and for future use.

The war continues in Ukraine, Algeria threatened Spain with cutting off relations which is important as this country gets all its gas from Algeria. The reason? Spain's attitude to Morocco, their hated neighbour and all because of the former Spanish territory, Western Sahara, which wants to become independent from Morocco. But there was one story which, although depressing in its own right, really caught my attention and that is because it was about animals, bears in this case.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Spain has a population of between 200 and 300 Iberian brown bears in the north of the country, mainly in Leon, Palencia and Asturias. The day we arrived here, our neighbour, Guzmán, told Eladio how he and his wife had encountered one not from far from this village. The story in the news which has now spread internationally is about how a male bear attacked a female bear to kill its baby bear. Not being the father, the intention is to kill the young and make the female fertile again so that it can mount the female. This is apparently common practice and rather savage but it happens in the animal world. The fight took place on the side of a rocky mountain and was captured on camera by two passersby and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58PxYT5vZKY">video which you can see here</a> went viral. The mother bear fought valiantly to protect her cub and during the fight, the male bear got knocked off a cliff and went tumbling down to its death.  </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2hIdDXimdMQrMTNNDz4s12Cvf--rVEucl4EKDxpMBHsjlnmaV3Y3GJr4NCNxXUWnGBbT_xM3Lo7HXlrmzy6t3YkSaZycaDHRcVy4fDfC5GGzoNUmtF_xEbGumX4_TItvNVhlg_4O8rEQCYWtfxMe4JhZbrv0UHpLMAMRN-OOGLuRNd4Ls9z8/s259/Dead%20bear.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2hIdDXimdMQrMTNNDz4s12Cvf--rVEucl4EKDxpMBHsjlnmaV3Y3GJr4NCNxXUWnGBbT_xM3Lo7HXlrmzy6t3YkSaZycaDHRcVy4fDfC5GGzoNUmtF_xEbGumX4_TItvNVhlg_4O8rEQCYWtfxMe4JhZbrv0UHpLMAMRN-OOGLuRNd4Ls9z8/w400-h300/Dead%20bear.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The male bear which fell off a cliff to its death</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The mother bear fell too but  apparently survived as did the cub. Bear conservationists have placed a camera in the bear den and have left food for mother and baby. We now know the cub is unscathed but the mother has yet to be seen. What a story. It comes after the Paddington bear story last week during the Platinum Jubilee but is of a very different nature. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Friday came and it was to be a scorcher in most of Spain. In some parts the temperature would rise to above 40ºc. We were told by the weather people that this could be one of the earliest heat waves in years. Thankfully it was not so hot in Montrondo but did reach 35ºc in León, the capital town of the province where we spent most of the day on Friday. Eladio and his brothers and sisters had an appointment in the city so we left at 10 ish. We thought it was only an hour to the city but it is nearly 1.5h and we were a bit late. I stayed outside with Pippa and was joined by my sister-in-law Dolores and we had a coffee together in a shady street. We then went in search of a "hole in the wall" which was an excuse for killing time before lunch with Eladio's family at 2 pm. I also searched for some comfortable walking sandals but didn't find anything suitable. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We were back in the village by 5 or so. As Montrondo is so high up - at over 1000 metres, the temperatures here are cooler but even so it was around 28ºc or so. We lay outside on the sun loungers but in the shade of course. The garden behind our house is called "La Era" and we love it. It's so quiet and peaceful and no one can see you. Pippa loves it too.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJXCHUsOh0iReB_fOg44scJ6xUV6kt_kZ7HPsROC-tHYd1WN6ghD7eZP8OHLtoozUCnFhWALFBAps61QHbAxN550Hg1pdAOZbe8nS1FI5AcMSjACYCkwlQ2ZM7pVr68UvF2vsqSMhFC07vTHDGoQ-MqTUdmUP6UUGs4-C9WIbwxCsL4vRTE_g/s762/La%20Era%20chilling%20out.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJXCHUsOh0iReB_fOg44scJ6xUV6kt_kZ7HPsROC-tHYd1WN6ghD7eZP8OHLtoozUCnFhWALFBAps61QHbAxN550Hg1pdAOZbe8nS1FI5AcMSjACYCkwlQ2ZM7pVr68UvF2vsqSMhFC07vTHDGoQ-MqTUdmUP6UUGs4-C9WIbwxCsL4vRTE_g/w400-h180/La%20Era%20chilling%20out.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjn3YN78NK6jpnUm0CNyB4cSRb4XSwovRk6GdtqEN4Di-QCYgggS8TULrUMr43ybI1jo2DW9fbDonhTEti7h41gj6nQBpvv6BKWwsMNHFvWaHsQ-bEc6qhWDIWITis3xxKgmSTMTRhARW3jDYgqjMj6Fjta7aHNvL3dD4OXm0yjfUaNcrda2qc/s3306/PIppa.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjn3YN78NK6jpnUm0CNyB4cSRb4XSwovRk6GdtqEN4Di-QCYgggS8TULrUMr43ybI1jo2DW9fbDonhTEti7h41gj6nQBpvv6BKWwsMNHFvWaHsQ-bEc6qhWDIWITis3xxKgmSTMTRhARW3jDYgqjMj6Fjta7aHNvL3dD4OXm0yjfUaNcrda2qc/w217-h400/PIppa.jpg" width="217"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Chilling out in Montrondo</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The grass in La Era was knee deep when we arrived so my dear husband had to cut it with a scythe.

He was not particularly interested. I suppose that's because he has seen it so many times in his life.

I felt comfortable didn't I?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I went home to relate the events to my husband who was interested to know who had led the procession.

My siesta was very long and I was woken up by my sister-in-law and her daughter at 6 p - I suppose I needed to catch up on my sleep. I had a cup of tea with them, or rather decaf tea so as to be able to sleep that night. I then joined the family who were celebrating one of the youngest member's birthday. There are so many great nieces and nephews I wished Elliot was there to play with them. But he is away at the beach with his parents. He will be here at the end of July though and I look forward to that. Montrondo is a great place for small children; there are lots of them and it is very safe.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It began to rain at around 7pm which we found strange. That's why it's so green here  I suppose. Later last night there was a tremendous thunderstorm with lightening and thunder which terrified poor Pippa. It terrified her so much we had to take her to bed with us. Then it started pouring it down and the noise was very loud.  Eladio went out to look and oh my goodness there was a very strong hail storm. But this morning the sun is out and it looks like it will be a pleasant day. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Next week I shall be writing from our other village, "El Cuetu" in Asturias where we are taking Eladio's brother and wife who haven't seen our "new" house yet.
