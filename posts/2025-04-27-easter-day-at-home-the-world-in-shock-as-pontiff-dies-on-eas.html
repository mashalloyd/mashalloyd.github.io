I am not a Catholic although I have many links to this church, so why should I be sad? I think the answer is that this extraordinary Argentinian,&nbsp; touched everyone's lives even if they were not believers.&nbsp; He was a man of the people who said what he thought and had great empathy as well as a wonderful sense of humour. He led by example which is one of the best ways to lead. His main example was to be on the side of the poor and the marginalised, just like Jesus. He owned nothing, had no bank account and even though he was entitled to a 6 figure salary he rejected it. When he died all he had in his pocket was 100 euros; his only possessions a cheap watch, a bible and a pair of old shoes. When he became Pope he chose the name Francis after Francis of Assis, the saint of poverty and simplicity. Francis, then Bergoglio, had taken a lifelong vow of poverty. Not for him the trimmings and the luxurious life of many in the Vatican. He made that clear the day he was elected Pope in 2013.&nbsp; He refused to wear the red shoes and more importantly refused to live in the Papal quarters, preferring to live in the more simpler Santa Marta residence with just 2 rooms. The other reason was that he wanted to live with people and not alone. He may not have reformed the church as much as he would have wanted but it is enough for me to hear from a Pope "who am I to judge homosexuals?". One of his main messages was forgiveness and after seeing the film The Two Popes and two documentaries about his life, I think I understand why. He himself was not without sin and will be forever criticised for his behaviour during the Military dictatorship in his home country. We were not there, we don't really know what happened but from what I understand he could not blatantly make a stand against the Junta if he wanted to help from behind the scenes.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Last Sunday</b> he made a surprise appearance in St. Peter's Square. After so many months of serious illness, he was not expected to give the Easter blessing called Urbi et Orbi (to the city - of Rome - and to the world) but he did.&nbsp;</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7IYWYDCR-kLdKKYl-Irn7NkDqBIUMCmB-RTvAzFKWxXzYRLuxl2efr-U1DHtWMtQXmwwR48htXqFoj7QkPQTBqx3rVJYcOQejzRAZhj-3qi-e7jklAgjIog0DUNDW5xw6XVNs7AdkXiul0-AvfqDNmfoJAWQN1YX-PMeMQ3uRk0eCVqb_ii0fqg/s1080/Urbi%20et%20Orbi.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="710" data-original-width="1080" height="263" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7IYWYDCR-kLdKKYl-Irn7NkDqBIUMCmB-RTvAzFKWxXzYRLuxl2efr-U1DHtWMtQXmwwR48htXqFoj7QkPQTBqx3rVJYcOQejzRAZhj-3qi-e7jklAgjIog0DUNDW5xw6XVNs7AdkXiul0-AvfqDNmfoJAWQN1YX-PMeMQ3uRk0eCVqb_ii0fqg/w400-h263/Urbi%20et%20Orbi.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Pope's last Urbi et Orbi last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>He then got into the Popemobile and went around the famous square in what must have been a huge effort for this frail Christian who wanted to go on working even when his body no longer could. As I watched him I wondered if it would be his last Easter Blessing. It was of course, but I didn't expect him to die the next morning. It seems fitting though that he died on Easter Monday, a day of joy in the Christian calendar.&nbsp;</p><p>Our Easter day was very quiet. Of note we went on our walk and should be doing so daily but have got a bit lazy. I made an effort and served a proper roast meal with chicken and all the trimmings.

Facebook reminded me that two years ago that day, we had set off on our first and most extraordinary road trip all the way to Armenia. We went off again last year at the beginning of May and got as far as Turkey. I'm afraid there won't be any more road trips for as long as Suzy is in our care.<div><br /></div><div>That morning I was busy with guests leaving and guests coming .I was showing Fernanda from Costa Rica how to work the TV in her room when I learned of the death of Pope Francis, aka Jorge Bergoglio, aged 88. It was 10.30 and I saw the news on Oli's programme, La Hora de la 1. He had died of a stroke at 07.30 that very morning, the day after his last Orbi et Urbi. I just couldn't believe it, or rather I could as he was so ill, but I was in shock and even shed a few tears. I didn't know the man, I am not a proper believer and nor am I a Catholic, yet I reacted as such. He has touched so many lives in such a humble and normal way, that for me, at least in my life, he is the best Pope of my times. Christians around the world were in shock too and the news is ongoing. TV stations flocked to St. Peter's Square to cover the news of his death, the estimated 250.000 people who queued up to see his coffin, his funeral on Saturday and of course the famous Conclave when a new Pope will be elected.&nbsp;</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8Z9S7H67k0xT7B_ff3JIXmpTAuNZIAPmmKHlMUBXDKIdDnZdxWqXr6E5R9c0sl1US3XASaktLOgYW4HUhtIrwWR51gXcGOAJPEejmTZjyiPr3FH_sI1_ycN8xn7GTZ1AbGytXZ-d0Z1CuZffjVLfsP_m3mrDPTUjmLzoWVXZoG4srG9gqcaa-7Q/s1080/pope%20coffin.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="697" data-original-width="1080" height="259" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8Z9S7H67k0xT7B_ff3JIXmpTAuNZIAPmmKHlMUBXDKIdDnZdxWqXr6E5R9c0sl1US3XASaktLOgYW4HUhtIrwWR51gXcGOAJPEejmTZjyiPr3FH_sI1_ycN8xn7GTZ1AbGytXZ-d0Z1CuZffjVLfsP_m3mrDPTUjmLzoWVXZoG4srG9gqcaa-7Q/w400-h259/pope%20coffin.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Pope lying in state at St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican this week</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div>There are 252 cardinals, 110 of them appointed by the Pope himself. However as cardinals aged over 80 can neither take part in the voting nor become Pope, only 135 will be at the Conclave, the date of which has not yet been fixed. The big question is whether a Pope of the same mind as Francis will be elected or whether it will be a Ratzinger like man. My hope is for the former.&nbsp;</div><div><div><br /></div><div>Life continued for us of course and that day saw us out on our walk and then on&nbsp; errands.

Olivia took the chance to interview the Pope's Nunciature in Spain, Cardinal Bernardito Cleopas Auza, from the Philippines. My daughter asked him whether a Pope like Francis would be elected, meaning a reformist. His answer was that there isn't another Francis. Olivia concluded the Apolostolic Nuncio is a conservative. At least she got to ask a question to a member of the Conclave; any journalist's wish at this moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><div>It was a joy to have Oli for lunch that day and she certainly brightened our lives up. We made plans for Suzy's birthday events - she turns 41 tomorrow and we saw her again on Saturday when she, her husband and kids came for a special pre birthday family lunch.</div><div><br /></div><div>My neighbour, Ekaterina, also cheered me up that afternoon when she brought me some Kulich and coloured eggs - staple foods for Russian Easter. Of note, this year,&nbsp; the Russian Orthodox Julian calendar coincided with the Gregorian calendar of the Western Christian churches. It was a lovely gift and reminded me of my childhood when my mother lovingly prepared Russian Easter. Kulich is a special cake which is very similar to panettone.&nbsp; This was it.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEint2RMHdbUPf9mALYW1Ii_WhBRxlrHuTT4mThuch0tLUOA-B2vSLyJuwjK5LJ8kFaJ4nIh-ojzS_FOJ78ophLlFuO5SPc1_wb6kv2KwE76_58c9Le_FfOl3kYiKuJi8e7OyZsenubIt3KWo_ChmcOv72s0buj3-BE8HsFQ9Xquq02ZEbWD1_f8wA/s4032/20250422_175040.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="4032" data-original-width="1816" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEint2RMHdbUPf9mALYW1Ii_WhBRxlrHuTT4mThuch0tLUOA-B2vSLyJuwjK5LJ8kFaJ4nIh-ojzS_FOJ78ophLlFuO5SPc1_wb6kv2KwE76_58c9Le_FfOl3kYiKuJi8e7OyZsenubIt3KWo_ChmcOv72s0buj3-BE8HsFQ9Xquq02ZEbWD1_f8wA/w180-h400/20250422_175040.jpg" width="180" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Kulich and coloured eggs from my Russian neighbour, Katya.

It was a happy moment and as I don't have many photos for this week's blog post, I asked her to take one of us. This is us, growing old gracefully together. I wouldn't want to be married to any other person than my dear husband Eladio, my partner in life.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvRm_lh7e3bI1m03fwe_zyoWm1_BYzcxmNwYpYQ2xnF0JC2XTrlp0C6NGWmXolJe0dR7zAjGgFGax1kh_-YBNfCEmjgIn12la9ITek5KvM8UV84Xi9N3bQTKvIDzC56xjZetjnRq4opnkxbocFFJEPiBTjDXDlHnJ-iyOiX5aWuAuo6d7q8IeUyw/s4032/20250423_115943.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1816" data-original-width="4032" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvRm_lh7e3bI1m03fwe_zyoWm1_BYzcxmNwYpYQ2xnF0JC2XTrlp0C6NGWmXolJe0dR7zAjGgFGax1kh_-YBNfCEmjgIn12la9ITek5KvM8UV84Xi9N3bQTKvIDzC56xjZetjnRq4opnkxbocFFJEPiBTjDXDlHnJ-iyOiX5aWuAuo6d7q8IeUyw/w400-h180/20250423_115943.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Coffee with Eladio, the highlight of my days</i></td></tr></tbody></table>While out, we took Pippa to the local vet to weigh her. You will remember she had a back problem and was put on a diet to lose 600 grammes. She had only lost 100 grammes but I suppose that is the equivalent of 1 kilo for an adult human being. Poor Pips.</div><div><br /></div><div>That afternoon I went to have my second shingles jab. Both Eladio and I signed up for the jab as he got it and badly in Armenia two years ago. I will always remember how well we were treated at the local health centre in Dilijan. I expected a terrible place but was pleasantly surprised at just how efficiently it was run. We were seen by a dermatologist who only spoke Russian or Armenian. The dear man resorted to ringing his son who spoke English to be his translator. We had insurance but it wasn't needed. Everything was free except for the medication. It took weeks for Eladio to recover properly so when we were offered the jab in December we didn't hesitate for a minute. If you haven't had yours, go for it because shingles can be very dangerous. While at the clinic I bumped into my neighbour and friend, Elena and her mother Angeles. Elena who was also a communications director and who I met in the sector, spends her retirement almost perpetually on cruises with her husband. Not my choice, but she loves it.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Thursday</b> came and the temperature rose to 24ºc which meant we could now have meals on the kitchen patio which is heaven for us. In the morning I accompanied Eladio to that God forsaken town on the outskirts of Madrid called Móstoles where I have horrible memories of the trial to oust our Russian squatter, Felipe Turover. While Eladio went to get one of his hearing aids repaired I scoured the cheap Chinese boutiques for summer clothes.

It seemed so fitting to watch it as a real life Conclave is coming up. In the book and film, one of the Cardinals had just been ousted from his post which poses a problem for the Camerlengo. And this very week we have learned that Pope Francis revoked all of Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke's privileges. This prominent and ostentatious American traditionalist opposed the Pope publicly, was ousted by him yet&nbsp; still insists he is allowed to take part in the Conclave. I think the last thing the late Pontiff wanted was for Burke to take part. It's a disgrace to the Catholic church if he does.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div><b>Friday</b> came and I read that Spain was once again the 2nd most visited country after France and ahead of the USA. However, since Trump has been in power there has been a marked decline in people wanting to visit the US, not just because of the man and his policies but because his border officials seem more fascist than democratic these days. As a non American have you ever had a good experience entering and leaving the USA? I haven't and I hold a UK passport.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The house was busy again. Our Chinese guests were leaving to be replaced by 7 young people from León and Asturias bringing with them 4 tuned cars which they treated as if they were the most precious thing in the world. There's nowt so queer as folk as they would say in my beloved Yorkshire. Of note that day we had all our meals outside in the good weather and in my diary that day I had included my 7.45 pm weekly jab of Mounjaro. I've been on it since 21st February. Let's see how much I have lost when I weigh myself on Monday.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Saturday</b> was the highlight of the week as Oli and family were coming for dinner - we thought. While out shopping Oli rang to say they were coming for lunch. Well, thankfully I had plenty of time to improvise a smashing lunch with the help of Tana bless her.</div><div><br /></div><div>We had cockles and mussels, sushi (for some), pizza (for some), gazpacho and a delicious dish of chicken and rice which I shall be repeating again. Oli had brought Suzy a plant and&nbsp; huge box of Nestle chocolates. Here is the moment she and Juliet are opening the box.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiGzv1n5vKe2Y-EEKaJtU5M30FA7I4cT5c3j6kjzragGbissgd4qcmNP5vzzqxxZnoly_wx55CYEhkbgqmpTuMlUK6IcOCojXSy-n3qUWsDCITQjonvyX3I0hajLRUsHx78PBRn3zkRvqLvu4xcipEMoVPdVyJKH6hdVH_1kbGvaBV2naBwRJ464A/s2016/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-04-26%20at%2015.04.34_11c7a523.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="908" data-original-width="2016" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiGzv1n5vKe2Y-EEKaJtU5M30FA7I4cT5c3j6kjzragGbissgd4qcmNP5vzzqxxZnoly_wx55CYEhkbgqmpTuMlUK6IcOCojXSy-n3qUWsDCITQjonvyX3I0hajLRUsHx78PBRn3zkRvqLvu4xcipEMoVPdVyJKH6hdVH_1kbGvaBV2naBwRJ464A/w400-h180/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-04-26%20at%2015.04.34_11c7a523.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Juliet and Suzy yesterday opening her box of chocolates</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Poor Elliot arrived asleep and remained so until well after we had all finished eating. But he still enjoyed the chicken and rice and cockles and mussels.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Saturday was of course the day of the Pope's funeral. Had I been alone at home with Eladio we would have watched it from beginning to end. Instead we just watched the summary on the news. I think the Pope planned his own funeral and wanted it to be as simple as it could be for a Pontiff. Doing away with tradition, he was buried at his favourite church, Santa Maria Maggiore, instead of St. Peter's Basilica. He was laid to rest there after a funeral in St. Peter's Square which gathered together politicians and royalty from all over the world as well as 250.000 mourners.It was wonderful to see how the late Pope united the world's leaders at least for one day.&nbsp; A young Argentinian spoke to the BBC saying <i>"Francis was a very humble person with a big heart who helped many people. It is a very sad day, not only for us Argentinians, but for the whole world."</i> I think he spoke for us all.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The best seats were given to Italian and Argentinian authorities. The rest, sovereigns, prime ministers and heads of states were seated behind and in alphabetical order in French, the language of diplomacy. Thus I imagine Etats-Unis was near Espagne and Estonie. Not far away was Zelensky with whom Trump had talks with for 15 minutes before the funeral.&nbsp;</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiOFrYHnFeLqsK_ms1RF6JQazjNCMzPGUycA8h0m3JK8RiB5xVXMrFg0v9S1j3vrno8IKzd1IvoTEWo2uncqSt9682QNRbUtHrLiHiBJdzOwqHhTYRuqCB53ol3O4wAmJ5GEzZHiDr_hVC66nMcDN_98Ac6uJUrLDVGINelc4-XYVHIQHM4gmcebg/s1325/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-04-27%20at%2009.17.20_748b8869.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1325" data-original-width="1080" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiOFrYHnFeLqsK_ms1RF6JQazjNCMzPGUycA8h0m3JK8RiB5xVXMrFg0v9S1j3vrno8IKzd1IvoTEWo2uncqSt9682QNRbUtHrLiHiBJdzOwqHhTYRuqCB53ol3O4wAmJ5GEzZHiDr_hVC66nMcDN_98Ac6uJUrLDVGINelc4-XYVHIQHM4gmcebg/w326-h400/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-04-27%20at%2009.17.20_748b8869.jpg" width="326" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Trump and Zelenski talking about peace in The Vatican.

All seemed upbeat about a potential peace treaty for Ukraine. Padre Francisco you were on the side of peace, on the side of those who live on the edge of society and immigrants, you were also on the side of the planet so I only hope yesterday that you managed to intervene for real peace to happen for Ukraine. I bet you were smiling up there while watching these leaders talk of peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>When the funeral was over, the cortege drove slowly through the streets of Rome until it reached the Santa Maria Maggiore Basílica. In a huge break with tradition, Pope Francis had insisted there be room there for those marginalised from society. Thus when his coffin reached its destination it was greeted by transgender women. The interment was private but he had made sure that prisoners, prostitutes and the poor were to be invited and they were. During his 13 years of being Pope he met many people like this with whom he struck up friendships. Will the next Pope be the same? If only. What a man, I take my hat off to him and salute him and thank him for everything he did. The world is a poorer place without him.&nbsp;</div><div><br /><div>Today is <b>Sunday</b> and will be quiet. Our 8 guests are leaving and our guests from China and Costa Rica are returning. It will be a busy morning for Tana. But then she is off until Tuesday. What would we do without her?<br /><div><br /></div><div>Now my friends, I have come to the end of the&nbsp; tails of this week which will forever be remembered for the sudden death of Pope Francis. Thank you for everything, you will be sorely missed.
