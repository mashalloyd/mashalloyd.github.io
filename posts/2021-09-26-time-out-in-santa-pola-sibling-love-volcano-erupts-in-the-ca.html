I had hoped to tell you about a lovely wedding we should have been at yesterday but as it turned out I couldn't go because I am grounded and out of action. Read on to find out what happened.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;"><br></br></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">How has your week been? Mine was great until Wednesday evening and after reporting on this week's Covid numbers I shall tell you all about it.</div><p style="text-align: justify;">This time last Sunday the global figures for infections and death were 228.952.022 and 4.070.279. Today they have gone up to 232.295.615 and 4.757.625. In Spain the number of people newly infected per 100.000 is decreasing daily. The latest figure was 71 but we still have to be watchful. Last week in this country they began giving a third jab to senior citizens in care homes. I understand the possible need but I would really like to see news on ramping up a proper vaccination programme in third world countries. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Last Sunday we left for Santa Pola rather late, at around 12. We had aimed to go at 10.30 but had to wait for Suzy who was late. We were going there for pleasure but also for work purposes.  Recently I was finally granted a tourist licence and needed to register the apartment with the local police. That means that I will have to register any guests from now on. It's a bit of a bind but at least it means renting the apartment  is now legal.  </p><p style="text-align: justify;">The day we were going, other guests were leaving. I hoped Macarena and her family would leave me a good review. I was terribly pleased to get 10 stars from the guests before her. Three young men from France left me the best review ever on Booking. This summer I have had many more reservations through Booking rather than Airbnb. It's a mystery to me. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh10pj0oBbaqOI66_LPmwCOReMHLX8JZKaG6M_yHlM7etbPtoRNcb28p5dW3dX0zXmnAK2rZrpfANzB4TP_MRXiQOoVeLtvlK50EuKDk7Oee-AYcRW0qyBxI2_AGx3QkSG2iYjX3Q/s1615/review.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh10pj0oBbaqOI66_LPmwCOReMHLX8JZKaG6M_yHlM7etbPtoRNcb28p5dW3dX0zXmnAK2rZrpfANzB4TP_MRXiQOoVeLtvlK50EuKDk7Oee-AYcRW0qyBxI2_AGx3QkSG2iYjX3Q/w265-h400/review.jpg" width="265"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A great view for our apartment in Santa Pola</i></td></tr></tbody></table>The apartment now has an overall score of 9. You can see the link <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/sea-view-holiday-apartment-near-alicante.en-gb.html?aid=964694&amp;app_hotel_id=6885594&amp;checkin=2021-09-19&amp;checkout=2021-09-20&amp;from_sn=android&amp;group_adults=2&amp;group_children=0&amp;label=Share-KZCktN%401632070480&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;req_adults=2&amp;req_children=0&amp;room1=A%2CA">here</a>.  It would probably be 9.5 if it weren't for one bad review from a woman who complained about the noise of the fans. She gave me a 4 which took the average down a lot. Unlike Airbnb, on Booking it is only the guest who can make a review which is not very fair. Hopefully any future guests will see that all the other reviews are great and will ignore hers. She complained about mosquitoes of which there are many along the whole coast. Last week we put in mosquito nets in the windows of the three bedrooms. Hopefully there will be no more complaints about them now.<div><br></br></div><div>That made me happy. I was happy too to be traveling to our apartment although the 4 hour drive is a bit of a bore. What made it more pleasurable was the picnic lunch we had on the way. We stopped at the little town of Honrubia whree we found a deserted park to set up our lunch.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZtksLdV8xD-jmwBncdCyECWeE7Wrb5VfRJ6DqYxRb-5PH9C7v67_1bPj1zOzCUjbu6OKUMW3800nfX5_bz6IcLQreM_3iQmh4nTii151grobNlOpNfakKpIRshr3zWTT2s6VZ1w/s2642/Sun+picnic+Honrubia.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZtksLdV8xD-jmwBncdCyECWeE7Wrb5VfRJ6DqYxRb-5PH9C7v67_1bPj1zOzCUjbu6OKUMW3800nfX5_bz6IcLQreM_3iQmh4nTii151grobNlOpNfakKpIRshr3zWTT2s6VZ1w/w400-h180/Sun+picnic+Honrubia.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Picnic lunch on the way here</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>My happiness would have been complete if Oli and her little family could have come with us but of course Juliet is far too small yet to travel.

He will in time and I hope their sibling love will blossom. <div><br></br></div><div>It was on the road about an hour after our picnic that we heard "the news". The big news topic in Spain this week was the story of the eruption of a volcano called "Teneguía" but also "Cumbre Vieja". It is located on the small island of La Palma in the Canary Islands not to be confused with Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. It's one of the smaller islands and has a population of approximately 80.000. La Palma relies on tourism and agriculture for its economy, both badly hit now by the volcano. I was amazed to read that the island produces approximately 130 million kilos of bananas a year. That's a lot of bananas. </div><div><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This volcano has erupted for the 8th time in 600 years. That makes me wonder why people built houses in the vicinity. The last time Teneguía erupted was in 1971, 50 years ago and it had been rumbling now for weeks. Finally it erupted last Sunday at around 15h which was earlier than predicted.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLNWmYzPKmfetUXD5USOpniuP2oEMY3V0jPePZr1f9ducw-AQxUMjwFgQJzE44D32q32VHz3eME_zLt8IrTZueNjetcHIItk8z1JfBgVQrYsWb3B1YpTXuocRk11Ikthw84nkkNQ/s828/ICOPZVUR54L2IR6VBJ2UULCHPA.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="249" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLNWmYzPKmfetUXD5USOpniuP2oEMY3V0jPePZr1f9ducw-AQxUMjwFgQJzE44D32q32VHz3eME_zLt8IrTZueNjetcHIItk8z1JfBgVQrYsWb3B1YpTXuocRk11Ikthw84nkkNQ/w400-h249/ICOPZVUR54L2IR6VBJ2UULCHPA.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The volcano erupting last Sunday in La Palma</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">5500 people from a few villages nearby had to be evacuated. There were fears too for people's houses as the lava made its way to the sea. By yesterday over 500 houses had been destroyed, engulfed by rivers of lava  Another 1500 are expected to be destroyed too. According to the Canary Islands Volcanology Institute the eruption released up to 20 million cubic metres of magma. The lava was moving at 700 metres per hour but as the week progressed its pace decreased to less than 100 metres per hour and is now hardly moving. No one knows how long the volcano will continue to expel rock and lava but an estimate is over 50 days.  There are two main rivers if that's what they are called and one halted. The other will reach the sea at one point.  It must be dreadful to watch the lava streams and know your house is going to be engulfed. Some escaped the tragedy and this photo by Spain's acclaimed photographer, Emilio Morenatti speaks volumes. It is of a single house metres only from lava on both sides which was not destroyed. It has been photographed by others and has hit the headlines internationally with the house being called "the miracle house". </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhlZyGpk5Z1F1DFNSJ2ClTywhhMy7Ya7smicl0-ByYlDzroxWVV0PNb2WR1sEDSbkHb0bJpD-HY4l6SZY1gjBMSIYPwYk56vV0NaQtTYj_f1gKm6NCYVM17AKvwWEQ5kEK72GupIw/s1291/lone+house.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhlZyGpk5Z1F1DFNSJ2ClTywhhMy7Ya7smicl0-ByYlDzroxWVV0PNb2WR1sEDSbkHb0bJpD-HY4l6SZY1gjBMSIYPwYk56vV0NaQtTYj_f1gKm6NCYVM17AKvwWEQ5kEK72GupIw/w335-h400/lone+house.jpg" width="335"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A single house not engulfed by the lava in La Palma this week</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;">No doubt its owner will be relieved. However he or she will now live in a very isolated spot with difficult access as lava turns into rock. I later found out that the miracle house belongs to a Danish couple. They can't believe their luck but are upset about the natural disaster and the terrible consequences especially for the islanders. On top of this the inhabitants have to face the consequences of all the ash and smoke spreading everywhere. The smoke is said to have already reached the southern tip of the Spanish peninsula which is a long way away. As to the ash it is a danger in itself. There is so much of it that planes cannot use the runway and airline traffic has been cancelled. The only way out of the island now is by boat to Tenerife and there are not enough boats for those who need to leave. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">One hour or in some cases just 15 minutes, was a small margin for those whose houses were going to be destroyed, to rescue  their most valuable possessions. Only one person per household was allowed. The authorities told them to get their documents first, especially the house deeds which will be necessary to battle for insurance. How do you choose in such a short time what to take? Can you imagine the situation?  I know if I was in their position the first thing I would take after documents would be photos from old albums taken before digital photography existed and all my parents records. Then I suppose it would be PCs, etc and jewelry. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I  read that when the lava from a volcano hits the sea it causes explosions and produces clouds of acidic rain. As to the heat of the lava it was reported to be over 1.000 centigrade. I had to look up the  difference between magma and lava.  Magma is the name for the hot liquid rock under the earth's surface. When it is released and flows outside it is called lava. Isn't that a funny piece of information?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">Houses were destroyed but there were no casualties reported last Sunday when the Spanish Prime Minister cancelled his presence at a UN meeting and flew directly to the Canaries to be on the ground and meet with the authorities dealing with the natural disaster. On Monday after an earthquake of 3.8, elsewhere reported as 4.2, on the Richter scale, another fissure appeared which meant more residents had to be evacuated. Up to 10.000 will probably have to be evacuated as the rivers of lava flow down the mountains and into the sea. As yet they haven't reached the sea. When they do all hell will let loose. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The news of the eruption has hit the headlines the world over. A volcano erupting and causing rivers of lava is always a spectacle. However, when the Spanish Minister for Tourism, Reyes Maroto suggested it was a pull for tourism I was appalled and shocked. She apparently said "The Canary Islands are safe to visit and a volcano eruption there is a wonderful show"! A wonderful show when thousands have to flee their homes and hundreds lose their houses? Her words hit the headlines too and not for good reasons. How dare she say that? What a lack of compassion. Tourism should be the least of the worries of the Spanish government. She later volte faced and  apologised for her words. Maroto is a newly appointed minister who was not well known in Spain but no doubt she is now because of  her unfortunate words. In a way though she was right as there are many people curious to see the spectacle who have traveled to La Palma to see the volcano. I think that's downright stupid. </div><div><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Luckily there are no volcanoes anywhere near Santa Pola where we arrived at around 5 pm. Lucy, my neighbour, had done her job and the apartment was sparkling clean. In the old days we always had to clean on arrival and make the beds. I'm so glad we found Lucy to do that for us. We soon settled in and I relaxed for the rest of the day. It felt good to be back. As my Swedish neighbour, Magda, says "home away from home". It is. Thus it didn't take long to settle in. We were to experience for the first time our new anti mosquito nets in the bedroom windows. The whole coastline there is plagued by mosquitoes and I am always their target; not so Eladio or Suzy. I also came armed with repellent and a relief product. Despite all my measures I still got bitten. For mosquitoes not to enter the bedrooms the doors have to be closed all day. If  not the nasty tiny flying insects can be waiting for you at night. I spent our whole stay making sure our bedroom door was permanently closed hahaha.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></br></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjwtab4w2PDrHEMKRKCIl6xGc8YAiEWOddrPQb1bHLNRYVcMiAuyzH_lNEVKr7IGdZ7qXG_D644X7EyAYTrydK0i4GGg6niiWgLG6jtO66zRVolYhRKDi8RLOx-dq0iOAJgkumRnw/s2642/Sunday+view+from+the+balcony.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjwtab4w2PDrHEMKRKCIl6xGc8YAiEWOddrPQb1bHLNRYVcMiAuyzH_lNEVKr7IGdZ7qXG_D644X7EyAYTrydK0i4GGg6niiWgLG6jtO66zRVolYhRKDi8RLOx-dq0iOAJgkumRnw/w400-h180/Sunday+view+from+the+balcony.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The view from our apartment, a view I never tire of</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh3oeGg0513O6B_PUiSgg27r4TyEXO5Kzzj3ne9JsX5D9MfJWcHBm2-xNnTl7oQRWZDY03QKUAbCeFWBin1lf4VpiHi9eVDdsZ7-Fj0TKSD_VE6vPfsKzPy_yyvWlcQj-2yjBomJQ/s2642/Sunday+view+pool.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh3oeGg0513O6B_PUiSgg27r4TyEXO5Kzzj3ne9JsX5D9MfJWcHBm2-xNnTl7oQRWZDY03QKUAbCeFWBin1lf4VpiHi9eVDdsZ7-Fj0TKSD_VE6vPfsKzPy_yyvWlcQj-2yjBomJQ/w400-h180/Sunday+view+pool.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The beautiful pool overlooking the sea - another view I never tire of</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We had a light dinner, then watched the news - more about the volcano. I was up till late watching Grey's Anatomy on our lovely little terrace. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I woke up on Monday morning at 7 - a reasonable time to wake up, at least for me. It was to be a warm sunny day but with some clouds and the forecast was for rain. The rain didn't come though until late that night. We did what we always do on the day after our arrival; the food shopping at the ubiquitous Mercadona supermarket. I could hear a lot of English and presumed the Brits were back. The complex where we have our apartment is full of a lot of retired Brits and Scandinavians who have houses here. They usually spend the summer in their own countries and the winter in Spain because of the milder climate. </div><div><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Once home it was our mid morning coffee time which we usually have at 12 which is 11 in the UK so could be called "elevenses".  We like to go out for coffee nearby when we stay at our apartment  to a bakery which is where went on Monday. On our way back I just had to pop into the British supermarket, Quicksave, which has been going strong more or less since we bought the apartment 22 years ago in 1999. I got some decaf tea and then chocolate and ice cream. Suzy got chocolate too, Bournville, to make a vegan dessert with dates which I wouldn't taste as I am not fond of dark chocolate. I am however very fond of milk or white chocolate and one of my favourites is mint aero. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiWn197BZRYxr1RivImCI90fU_Xp9sQgQHSCPaw6U5stWaYy9wuwqKvlD-ET3iIk5LP1p-yOGLZm0mIk9OURrTQcJcYAr9QQ9gp2WTE6CnU_m30aBtQwAMo8otUe6Bz0FdhAmi2qw/s963/mint+aero.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="148" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiWn197BZRYxr1RivImCI90fU_Xp9sQgQHSCPaw6U5stWaYy9wuwqKvlD-ET3iIk5LP1p-yOGLZm0mIk9OURrTQcJcYAr9QQ9gp2WTE6CnU_m30aBtQwAMo8otUe6Bz0FdhAmi2qw/w400-h148/mint+aero.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>One of my favourite types of chocolate.

If I had we would have gone there when we were in Anglesey in the summer of 2019. I love the bridge but it's the cottage covered in ivy that really made an impact. I do love those sort of cottages. This cottage is actually an award winning tea house called Tu Hwnt l'r Bont Tea Room - try saying that. I could only imagine standing on that beautiful bridge or having afternoon tea at the cottage which I read is a 15th century grade II listed building. The river the bridge crosses is the River Conwy. One day I will go. I loved the picture so much I had to share it on Instagram and also make it my screensaver. I shall have to put this place on my ever increasing bucket list of places to visit. Of course the picture was taken on a sunny day but it must be just as beautiful on a wet day and Wales is a very wet region. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Santa Pola is the exact opposite of Wales but unusually it had rained all night. However,   by 9.30 or so the sky was clear and the sun came out. Wouldn't it be perfect if it only ever rained at night and was sunny during the day everywhere in the world? I wonder if technology will ever advance enough for that to happen? Maybe not in my life time but in Juliet's or Elliot's.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">That day Oli and Miguel were taking Juliet to the hospital where she was born to get the results of her hearing test (fine) and also to have her ears pierced for the little white gold star shaped earrings they had bought for her. If you are not from Spain you might think it is a bit extreme to pierce baby girls' ears but it is very common here. Mostly it is done to distinguish girls from boys when people peer into a pram and ask the gender. I remember both our girls getting their ears pierced just after they were born.  It's a very Spanish tradition and one I do not oppose. I had mine pierced in my late teens as in my days it wasn't very common in the UK. Later Oli sent us a photo of little Juliet with her earrings. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgdraY3N24Jp-K2X1ev_ROB_Jc8V4VZFXAXG8MfSKk3p2AOHuZvRX2OoYhfYNN-OjLp0IVVXUTSYWmQL-f4Gioshpfmxe5iN0RWvrrRCnbc-w_8NG7kDm4K1nWtoS8lVXrjL_rxzg/s1600/Wed+Juliet+earrings.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgdraY3N24Jp-K2X1ev_ROB_Jc8V4VZFXAXG8MfSKk3p2AOHuZvRX2OoYhfYNN-OjLp0IVVXUTSYWmQL-f4Gioshpfmxe5iN0RWvrrRCnbc-w_8NG7kDm4K1nWtoS8lVXrjL_rxzg/w225-h400/Wed+Juliet+earrings.jpg" width="225"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Juliet with her earrings.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>It's also a very Spanish thing to dress up baby girls in a very girly way - I used to do that - and for babies here to wear shoes even though they cannot walk. So when Oli posted this delightful photo of Juliet in a pretty little dress and pink Converse type shoes, my friend Sandra in Brussels found it very funny. Sandra didn't see the point if Juliet can't walk. It's not about walking it's about dressing up your baby girl and mothers like to do that here in Spain where looking smart and well dressed is a big thing. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8UCqlrwCNTkZyMRaZrp3E3ZG3boquRgsuQjh14Ljpm_7wwQpdLjExdl8tG8ltMFwEAI5XyYJV0bBy3hatZlrMcj2IkDIWeqL77GBCH6RkWfGzUX9gE6FU_fAHbsM974L4ZyBX7g/s1600/Juliet+shoes.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8UCqlrwCNTkZyMRaZrp3E3ZG3boquRgsuQjh14Ljpm_7wwQpdLjExdl8tG8ltMFwEAI5XyYJV0bBy3hatZlrMcj2IkDIWeqL77GBCH6RkWfGzUX9gE6FU_fAHbsM974L4ZyBX7g/w225-h400/Juliet+shoes.jpg" width="225"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Juliet in shoes she doesn't need but make her look good</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;">I think for a mother there is nothing nicer than buying clothes for your baby girl.  I used to love it and far more so than buying clothes for myself. I suppose it's like dressing your own real  dolls. Oli used to love dressing her Barbies and also the beagle puppies we used to have hahaha. Now she gets to do it for real. </div><div><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">While Juliet was at the hospital, Eladio and I had gone to Santa Pola to the Guardia Civil  (Civil guard similar to the Gendarmerie). I had to register our apartment with them which is the law in Spain when you have a tourist licence to rent property. They will then give me a password to register guests and guests will have to fill out a form with their details which I shall have to upload on the G.C online guest registry. I was told by the agent who received me that I had to keep the forms for 3 years. What a bind. He pointed out this was for everyone's safety and I suppose the registry exists to help the police or G.C find criminals. I hope I never host a criminal. But you never know. This was one of the main reasons we had gone to Santa Pola.</div><div><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Once our mission was complete we drove into the town centre for our  all important mid morning coffee. It's always difficult to find a parking spot near the main square, the castle square. Yes, Santa Pola has a castle as do many many towns in this region in their fight against the Moors centuries ago. We picked one of our favourite cafes, "Cafetería Juande" which we have been going to since the beginning. I think we came across it when we first came to search for an apartment back in 1999. It hasn't changed much and serves delicious coffee which we had under a parasol in the square. Before drinking the beverage I had to have photos to record the moment. It had to be one photo of each of us  rather than of us together. Eladio suggested we ask someone to take the photo but due to Covid I was hesitant. That is just one more thing that this damned virus has changed. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfzpwjwDzDukRjp9zO4ySO6gjwy2utcW05SeA3c-0rCiJdTCvVrqDa4aC_bDpdhpdRN4kwuY21KlI6-t-rpSR_Zvcshc7_fhEKV8Yw-DVhrHjMQjVsn6_vj0jPy_JSa-K29j1_vw/s2642/Wed+E+coffee+SP.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfzpwjwDzDukRjp9zO4ySO6gjwy2utcW05SeA3c-0rCiJdTCvVrqDa4aC_bDpdhpdRN4kwuY21KlI6-t-rpSR_Zvcshc7_fhEKV8Yw-DVhrHjMQjVsn6_vj0jPy_JSa-K29j1_vw/w180-h400/Wed+E+coffee+SP.jpg" width="180"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1EJk8FUMEmTE4Ab2-Z2awworH6baXiP2DTfzbdNmjoz_KrDGBeJZLp68uH4EVaCix4MkSXQiBXsGpbnETsNGoNSDVOfjbdK9wrKhu_LIWQZXv1YF-8yWj7arFGyaqc2R-j2vqug/s2642/Wed+me+coffee+SP.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1EJk8FUMEmTE4Ab2-Z2awworH6baXiP2DTfzbdNmjoz_KrDGBeJZLp68uH4EVaCix4MkSXQiBXsGpbnETsNGoNSDVOfjbdK9wrKhu_LIWQZXv1YF-8yWj7arFGyaqc2R-j2vqug/w400-h180/Wed+me+coffee+SP.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Mid morning coffee with my husband - one of life's little pleasures - here in the main square of Santa Pola on Tuesday morning</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;">We took our time over it and enjoyed the moment.

That's because Santa Pola is beside the sea and we are up on  a cliff. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We had one last errand to do before heading home. I had to print out the registry forms for future guests. Near where we had parked I found the right place. I couldn't believe the price, 0,5 cents per copy which came to 5 euros for 100 copies. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We came home to make a very simple lunch - fish fried in bread crumbs with steamed fresh asparagus. We didn't go out again that day as it was not a beach warm day and it was also very windy. This area of Spain is known not just as the Costa Blanca but also as the "Levante" after the name of the wind. The wind was pretty strong that day so we stayed inside. The rest of the day was quiet and we enjoyed it peacefully in our little pad by the sea. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Wednesday came and despite the forecast it had not rained. It was  the warmest days of our stay and we decided to take advantage of the weather and spend the morning on the beach. It was just Eladio and I as Suzy had came to job seek as soon she will be living full time in our apartment in Santa Pola. She spent all her time on this during our stay and stayed behind when we left on Thursday. She is starting a whole new life and I hope it goes well for her. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Being the end of September there was no problem parking. There were people on the beach but far fewer than at the height of the summer. The sea looked a bit rough and the red flag was out but even so I went in but only to my knees. The water was warm and the feeling of the sun and water on my body was sensational. I got Eladio to take pics. He didn't want to go in at the beginning. I did because I knew it was my last chance this year. Later he would change his mind. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-vnsAvjNAdYrYgZNlhzNK4-dPnK1BBrydGJF3zPTPEsXnGjm3vSiWRz9ed7FOdNHV7qlyo4Q7-tdYxBbRgLxr1NhMaDc5SQeUDBVmNFQHMvRVgJbNaX2OlBL-AWiivrKt5c-51A/s2642/Thurs+me+water.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-vnsAvjNAdYrYgZNlhzNK4-dPnK1BBrydGJF3zPTPEsXnGjm3vSiWRz9ed7FOdNHV7qlyo4Q7-tdYxBbRgLxr1NhMaDc5SQeUDBVmNFQHMvRVgJbNaX2OlBL-AWiivrKt5c-51A/w400-h180/Thurs+me+water.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Me in the sea on Wednesday morning</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;">We sat for a while soaking in the sun and our surroundings and then set off on our walk to the end of the beach which takes about 25 minutes - it's a very long beach.

I would later regret my decision but not because of the food. Jenna, the owner, was very welcoming and remembered us from when we went in June. The whole atmosphere there and in the bars and restaurants around The Chippy 2 was very British. Fish and chips with mushy peas and bread and butter (didn't want the latter) comes at only 7.30 euros which is dirt cheap. I commented to Jenna that she should charge more but she said she couldn't as her clientele are mostly British pensioners who can't afford to pay more. That got me wondering what pensions are like in the UK and they don't seem so high. The portions served at The Chippy were pretty big and we had difficulty finishing what was on our plate.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6opPugKWHdZn6NJ28v7rnoUUaoehSwA5n3BOx0Cws5D2IOIXSqkiBMd1QTcXGDhISEkUHsv4-3FYmnsn4qgm2sMaa8P3znypwAY-HO1HTp5aMSh5aM08Emw3hXF3mZPA8KbLUOg/s2642/20210922_205218.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6opPugKWHdZn6NJ28v7rnoUUaoehSwA5n3BOx0Cws5D2IOIXSqkiBMd1QTcXGDhISEkUHsv4-3FYmnsn4qgm2sMaa8P3znypwAY-HO1HTp5aMSh5aM08Emw3hXF3mZPA8KbLUOg/w400-h180/20210922_205218.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Fish and Chips at The Chippy 2 in Gran Alacant - like being back in Blighty. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">We left promising to come back another time. It was while we were walking to our car that I made a wrong movement when walking off the kerb onto the street, missing the step and I thought I must have strained the big tendon in my knee. Suddenly I was in pain and couldn't walk as I could not put any weight on my leg. Oh what a terrible moment. It was difficult reaching the car and even more difficult getting up to the apartment. Thankfully Suzy was there to help. Suddenly I couldn't walk and would need help from my husband and daughter for every little thing. What had I done to my leg? </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Getting through the night was not easy. Suzy helped me in the morning and had to make my coffee. Thursday was Eladio's birthday but it passed as if it wasn't. I was in no condition to arrange anything and I felt sorry for my husband. He didn't seem to mind. But I did as birthdays are important to me. Instead of going to a local hospital we decided to pack and drive to Madrid and go to a hospital near home. Suzy decided to stay as she is in the throes of finding a job or jobs which really can only be done in situ. She helped Eladio pack and by 10.45 I was in the car from where I wouldn't move until we got to the hospital. We stopped on the way for lunch which was a "bocadillo" (sandwich) that Eladio bought for us from a bar and which we ate sitting in the car. It wasn't exactly a birthday lunch but the bocadillos at least filled our stomachs. I think we arrived at the Quiron Salud private hospital in Pozuelo on the outskirts of Madrid at around 16h. Eladio went inside to get a wheel chair for me which was a huge relief. I was there for nearly 2 hours with lots of waiting in between doing the X-rays and seeing the orthopedic consultant. He told me I had joint knee effusion which basically means water on the knee which was obviously caused by the slip on the pavement even if I didn't actually fall. He prescribed anti inflammatory meds, a knee pad and complete rest for 2 to 3 weeks. He reckoned I would be able to walk again in that time frame. Oh well at least nothing was broken and I had a diagnosis. I got Eladio to take a photo in the wheel chair. I wanted to send it to my dear friend Irene to explain why I wouldn't be able to go to her son's wedding yesterday. She was upset and so was I. Irene is part of the family I lived with as a sort of au pair when I lived in Spain in my 3rd year at Nottingham University. I consider them my Spanish family and love them dearly. I'm very sorry I missed the wedding. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So there I was grounded and out of action. I have been in this place before on quite a few occasions. The last time was about 6 years ago when I broke the bone in my ankle (the fibula) when I fell on ice in Montrondo. I had a cast put on and then an operation and it took more than 2 months to walk again. Thankfully the rest period will be shorter this time. Now you will understand why I wished we had never gone to eat fish and chips. If we hadn't I would not now be grounded and out of action. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Eladio delivered me home and brought me a PC chair with wheels to give me some autonomy. With the chair I wheeled myself to the kitchen door and through to the staircase. I then had to go up the stairs on my "behind" - the only way to do it. Lucy brought me another PC chair - my more comfortable desk chair - to give me autonomy on the bedroom floor. Finally I was able to move by myself. After unpacking with Lucy's help I set up my home and office in bed. I am surrounded by all my pills, pots and potions, PC, iPad, kindle, phone, pillows, chargers, etc and the PC chair is by my bed. I was too tired to make it downstairs again for dinner though and Eladio brought up a tray. Lucy had made Spanish omelette which we had with bread and gazpacho and grapes for dessert. Poor Eladio's birthday had been eclipsed by my injury and all preparations scaled down. As you will read we had a small celebration at home yesterday without the girls or his grandchildren. I was a bit sad for him. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Soon we were watching the news - more about the volcano which on Thursday evening was still 2km away from the sea. Eladio was tired from driving and I was tired from all the upheaval, plus my leg was hurting. So I fell asleep earlier than usual.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I woke up several times and had to use the wheelie chair to get to the bathroom and back to bed. I finally got up at 7 and managed it downstairs on my behind again and then had to get Lucy to bring me the other wheelie chair. I think it took me more than half an hour to make my breakfast hahaha. Being immobile makes you sympathise with paralysed people. The world is not made for them. It must be very hard to adapt. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I think it took me about 30 minutes to make my coffee, porridge and peeled fruit which I ate while reading the headlines. They were dire this week for the UK. There seems to be total chaos back home thanks to the pandemic and Brexit. I follow the Covid figures avidly every day and am astounded that my home country is reporting over 30.000 new infections daily and quite a high mortality rate too. It's not in the headlines any more. I wonder if that is because nobody seems to care any longer which I find unacceptable.  I also ask myself  how can that be after what was hailed as a very successful vaccination programme? Added to that now are fuel and supermarket shortages with scares of them affecting Christmas. There is panic buying and rationing of petrol at petrol stations. Why? Because there are not enough HGV drivers. Why are there not enough? Most probably because of EU lorry drivers not being able to work in the UK since Brexit.  The government has now taken a U turn and will allow "foreign" drivers to work in the UK with visas of up to 3 months. I wonder which French, Spanish or German HGV driver would be lured by a 3 month contract when they can work full time in the EU. I doubt that will be the answer. The answer for now is possibly bringing in the army to drive the lorries. What a bloody mess. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I had a very quiet day on Friday as you can imagine being grounded and out of action. I managed to shower myself by putting a stool in the shower. I spent most of the day in bed with my foot up and watching TV: Eladio did the shopping and also went to the chemist to get my knee cap which I have to wear during the day and the meds the doctor prescribed. It was a boring day and I have a lot of them ahead of me so I shall just have to grin and bear it.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I even missed meeting and greeting our new guests, a family from Luxembourg. Their daughter is at a boarding school nearby and they had come to celebrate her birthday. Eladio did my job that night and reported they were a lovely family. I'm sure he did his job well.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I did meet the mother while having breakfast on Saturday morning. Amandine is also an early riser. She is a top manager in a corporate company and reminded me a bit of myself when I was her age. I didn't see her again until this morning. I was happy to hear the family had had a great day which included a trip to the Madrid fun fair. Oh, I remember taking our girls there too. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Yesterday again I  was stuck in bed most of the day and only went up and down the stairs for meals. I did do exercises though, ones I googled. After all I have to move if I am going to be grounded for 2 or 3 weeks. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Apart from for meals I also went down to have a coffee with my husband at 12 and it was then that Lucy handed me a parcel that had arrived in our absence. It was a present for Pippa, our miniature chocolate dachshund, from my dear friend Jackie. She had sent me a back pack to carry Pippa if we ever need to.  I thought it would be a good idea when we take her to indoor places where dogs are not often allowed in Spain. It's called a Doggy Pack Pro and is made or sold by Paws for Thought. That's a great name for a dog accessory company. We tried it out immediately on little Pips as we often call her. At the beginning she trembled then calmed down. I think she was worried but then rather liked being held close to our heart. This is her in the doggy ruck sack. Thanks so much Jackie. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnoSOWpYXkoDkt2KL30_MvzDI5Xe2fAuiBIPpgiTAB7oEMBaC8ZkIFa6waGx89YQej4aVr2CbWZqnlJ9SjKLFfQeDd5V7R4YeHSjmGI9V8AqFOpiCep3WRmKmCHr4l7G1doejDcw/s2642/Sat+dog+ruck+sack+Pippa.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnoSOWpYXkoDkt2KL30_MvzDI5Xe2fAuiBIPpgiTAB7oEMBaC8ZkIFa6waGx89YQej4aVr2CbWZqnlJ9SjKLFfQeDd5V7R4YeHSjmGI9V8AqFOpiCep3WRmKmCHr4l7G1doejDcw/w400-h180/Sat+dog+ruck+sack+Pippa.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Trying out Pippa's "doggy pack pro"</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">It was on Saturday that we finally celebrated Eladio's birthday. Originally we would have done so today with all the family but Oli and co had gone to the beach and Suzy is in Santa Pola. Thus the beautiful cake I had ordered was far too big for just 4 of us; Eladio, my father, Zena - our weekend carer - and me. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I also got my dear husband two packs of handkerchiefs with the initial E on them. He is very old fashioned and still uses cotton handkerchiefs and his supply was dwindling. Then there was a birthday card just signed by me this year. In the photo below you will see the cake moment and probably the candles showing that Eladio turned 77 this week. 77!!! How can that be possible? My father commented he was "quite young". Well, for someone aged 102, 77 must seem positively junior. But you will also see that my dear husband hardly ages. He just doesn't look his age does he? I think he looks great. Love you Eladio and I'm sorry your birthday was rather scaled down this year.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgb6qPwtS4fmyk3dfTg8Cpgtyd6XB2BLw8p__0iV8abc9-Kgh4mADabsKUJBNZmWKpwu3nbCfkav8LVc2Dr9n6eXdgFgjSvONKw_c4lK5mrWbnEiMzK_nkRv2a5iqXZxy68Nx-SYg/s2642/Saturday+E+cake+bday.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgb6qPwtS4fmyk3dfTg8Cpgtyd6XB2BLw8p__0iV8abc9-Kgh4mADabsKUJBNZmWKpwu3nbCfkav8LVc2Dr9n6eXdgFgjSvONKw_c4lK5mrWbnEiMzK_nkRv2a5iqXZxy68Nx-SYg/w180-h400/Saturday+E+cake+bday.jpg" width="180"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Celebrating Eladio's birthday yesterday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;">When I am up and about we shall go out to dinner to make up for the scaled down celebrations. The cake by the way was absolutely divine (thanks Juana) but I'm afraid I ate far too big a portion. Thus I wasn't hungry for dinner and only had fruit and yoghurt. No doubt we shall eat some more for lunch today which is not good for me. The kilos are piling on and I must do something about it and soon. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Today my friends is Sunday, day 4 of being grounded. But there is a glimmer of hope. My leg doesn't hurt and although I can see some swelling from the water on my knee I tried to stand on both legs. That was ok. Then I took a step with the injured leg and wow I was able to walk. It was a Lazarus moment. I am so relieved. I have to take it carefully though and follow the doctor's orders and rest for 2 to 3 weeks and walk as little as possible. But it does mean now that I am not completely grounded. I am so relieved.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">On that happy note I shall leave you now until next Sunday.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cheers everyone,</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Masha. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><br></br><div><br></br><div><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br><div><br></br><div><br></br><p><br></br></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></br></div><br></br><br></br></div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></br></div><br></br>
