<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Here I am, “our woman in Havana” (inspired by Graham
Greene’s novel Our Man in Havana) writing this post the morning after we
arrived on 27<sup>th</sup> December from our lovely private hotel, “RentinVedado”.
  I shall be chronicling each day and
will only be able to publish it once home in Spain as internet here is
something of a luxury and difficult to obtain.

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Tuesday 27<sup>th</sup> December, the day of our trip
to Cuba with Toño and Dolores, finally arrived. I wasn’t really mentally
prepared for it as it was the middle of our family Christmas but got up to
speed, packing the day before, with last minute preparations. But first Eladio
and I had an appointment in Madrid at 9 in the morning with a lawyer, yeah a
lawyer. I haven’t needed one for many years and hope I won’t for many
more.  That meant we weren’t home until
11 and would have to leave the house at 1 when Suzy would drive us to the airport.  It was all a bit of a rush.  We boarded a big, brand new, Iberia Airbus at
4 pm and were facing a 10 hour flight across the Atlantic Ocean in very cramped
conditions.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

our trip to Israel and Jordan in 2010 and things have progressed. This airplane
had an individual multimedia touch screen monitor for each seat which impressed
me enormously. It offered many films, series, documentaries, music and the
flight path information.  I watched The
Second Best Marigold Hotel and then The Impossible.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Eladio mostly looked out of the window, slept or
watched the flight path and we both oohed and aahed as we flew over the Bahamas
for example.  The food on board was
pretty awful and I envied those in Business Class, remembering my many
transatlantic flights with Nokia all over the world when I used to travel in
luxury.  The space was very tight and
next to us was a family with a toddler and baby which cried and screamed for
most of the flight.  We left at 4 in the
afternoon and would arrive at 8 in the evening in Havana which for us would be
2 in the morning.  We didn’t get much sleep
and I wasn’t looking forward to the jet lag we would suffer.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Arrival was much as I expected, a bit of a chaos and
very slow.  There were lots of officials,
mostly women, dressed in uniforms with miniskirts but wearing black laced
tights.  They did look funny. We had been
told the wait for our luggage could be up to 3 hours.  I asked one of the officials how long it
would take to which she replied I should arm myself with patience as everything
in her country, she whispered to me, was very, very slow.  In the end, surprisingly, we only had to wait
an hour. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">The terminal was much what I expected, a bit forlorn,
quite modern but already dirty with many things, such as the escalators, not
working and no loo paper or soap in the toilets.  Soon Miguel, my nephew, arrived and we got
into a van he had hired where we loaded our luggage and 2 huge suitcases
Dolores had brought with essentials that Miguel and his Cuban wife, Claudia,
had asked for; many of the things being for their wedding on 3</span><sup style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">rd</sup><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">
January. I should add here that the excuse for visiting Cuba was to attend Miguel and Claudia's second wedding.  You see they married first in Madrid in a simple small family celebration at a registry office and only the immediate family was present;none of Claudia's. The wedding in Havana was for all her friends and family.  In between the 2 weddings Miguel and Claudia had also celebrated their marriage with a family lunch near Montrondo. For the record Eladio and I would be attending all 3. </span></div>

centre and the boulevard, El Bollero, was pretty empty. There are very few cars
here, mostly taxis, as the general population cannot afford to buy one. There are  more of course in the centre. It was pitch black (it got dark here at 6pm) and the
lighting was very dim and the streets seemed empty, even the main square, Plaza
de la Revolución, with its gigantic images of Che Guevara, Cienfuegos and José
Marti. The latter, whose Father was from Valencia, fought the Spaniards  in the fight for independence and is a
national hero.  Everywhere we were to see
posters publicizing the ongoing revolution such as this one with Cuba’s beloved
Che Guevara.  He is also a national hero
and known as one of the “comandantes”.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">After settling into our room we went to bed at around
11 pm in Havana, the equivalent of 5 in the morning.  It was warm, some 24c but thanks to the
ventilator, we were able to sleep.  I did
so on and off and finally got up at 6.45, local time, nearly 13h in Spain.  Thankfully I was to get my essential morning
coffee as the owner had arrived just as I got up. The rest slept on. The weather would be warm throughout with midday temperatures reaching nearly 30c most days, very different to the temperature in Madrid at this time of year.  It was supposed to be winter in Cuba and cooler but I was told that global warming had reached here and that it was much warmer than usual for December and January.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Wednesday 28<sup>th</sup> December would be our first
full day in Havana.  Like in Spain, it was
also the day of the “innocents”, the equivalent to “all fools’ day”.  Who knew how it would pan out.  Being our first time in Cuba with many
preconceived ideas, I was looking forward to getting to know the city a little
and how people here live. I was soon to find out the truth of Castro’s Cuba,
one of the last bastions of world communism. 
<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Cuba, the biggest island in the Caribbean has a
population of just under 12 million people and Havana has 2.1 million
inhabitants. It is known or was known as the “pearl” of the Caribbean. When Christopher
Columbus first set foot on its shores, he described it as “the most beautiful
earth that human eyes have seen”.  I tend
to agree.  My facts and figures may not
be completely accurate as none of my sources are guaranteed so please take them
as approximate.  It is famous for its
communist system and animosity to the US which is what it makes it so relevant
in the world.  Its people are proud and
independent, welcoming but mostly impoverished as all the goods we have in the
western world are a complete luxury here. 
The average monthly salary is about 30 euros per month; nearly the same
for street cleaners or doctors.  No one
can live on that and thanks to a recent law where people can own businesses,
life is getting slightly better.  But
only slightly.  From what we learned, the
regime seems to be opening too since the accord with Obama.  For instance we were told that just a few
years ago a Cuban could be imprisoned just for talking to tourists.  Thankfully today that is no longer a crime. The
way of life is frustrating, nothing works, the word “efficiency” is unknown and
corruption is rife.  On the plus side,
the climate is incredible with sun all year round, the people are kind and all
seem to be in a permanent good mood.  I
am told one way of making the people happy is to provide them with endless
amounts of cheap rum and cigarettes.  And
thus they don’t complain. People try to rip you off in the tourist areas but
that is to be understood.  Also they are
all very well educated and I am told the health system works well.  Cuba I think is probably one of the safest Latin
American countries. There is little violence here and robberies are apparently
few and far between.   I found the people
very hospitable, going out of their way to help a tourist in distress. We were
to experience that on many occasions as you will hear later. The revolution I
am also told is ongoing to preserve what communism has achieved, a good
education and health system. 
Unfortunately it has not achieved much else.  The regime’s hatred of capitalism is in
evidence because of the sheer lack of global brands such as McDonalds.  I, for one, am happy to be in a country
without one. There are hardly any advertising billboards which for me was a
relief. In their place there are plenty of billboards with communist slogans

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Thankfully there was some toast and butter.  I decided to buy some fruit that day but it
turned out to be nearly impossible. The only fruit available at the dismal
fruit and veg markets were over ripe bananas, tasteless water melon, over
ripe papaya and a strange and not very nice tasting fruit called
“guayara”.  The small bananas called
apple bananas (plátano manzana) turned out to be delicious. You would think
with the climate here, fruit in Cuba would be like in Mexico, spectacular, but
no it was very disappointing. Fruit doesn’t grow much here due to a measure by
Fidel Castro years ago when he wanted to double the production of sugar
cane.  Land for fruit was sacrificed as
one of the measures.  However, Castro’s
equivalent of the sugar cane five year leap proved to be a failure so today
sugar is declining and there is hardly any fruit to be found. What a pity!</span></div>

Eladio likens Havana to Aleppo, as so much of it is destroyed, rotting

American cars from the 40s and 50s.  They
are in abundance here and much photographed. 
The story goes that the Chevrolet models were owned by the middle class
and the Dodges or Cadillacs by the rich. 
Many of their owners left when Fidel Castro came to power and the
government confiscated them and then resold them to people who could afford
them. Those who had one and didn’t leave kept the car in the family. When the
American blockade came into force, Cuba was unable to import cars and those
that they have imported; mostly cars for tourists to hire, are sold at
extortionate prices.  We loved them as
most tourists do too.  They are
attractive to look at but are highly contaminating and the fumes they give off
make it difficult to breathe. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">The academy is small but very vibrant and each class
was full.  From there we drove to the old
centre of the city and here we had a great guide in “Pepo” (real name Eadberto)
who is Miguel’s right hand man in the running of his business.  Pepo was the leader of the University
Students Union and is a professor of contemporary history.  We learned from him that 37% of the
population is black, like he is and that they come originally from Africa, being brought here as slaves by the Spaniards.  The rest are all descendants of Spaniards,
mostly from Galicia and the Canary Islands. 
Today anyone who can prove their parents or grandparents were Spanish
immigrants can claim Spanish nationality. 
However, for many a passport from Spain is pretty useless as they cannot
afford the flights. At the end of the 19</span><sup style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">th</sup><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"> century Spain owned Cuba
but didn’t give enough rights to the population, although they mixed with them,
unlike the British in India for example. 
Spain owned Cuba from the late 16</span><sup style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">th</sup><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"> century. So there was a
war for independence, led by the country’s main hero, José Martí, whose father
was actually Spanish from Valencia. He is even more loved than old Fidel.  Everyone pointed out that the war in 1898 was
not against the Spanish people but against the Spanish government. Spain’s
heritage is evidenced here everywhere and Cubans refer to Spain as their Mother
country; “la madre patria”.</span></div>

locals, out for our money, like these two guitar players.  Eladio had to pay them 1 euro for the picture
although they asked for 20 haha. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">For lunch we were in for a very local treat. Instead
of going to a restaurant like other tourists – 
from what I can see, only non-Cubans can afford them - Miguel  took us to a private house, run by a
picturesque old lady called Fabiola, who was to cook for us in her own
house.  We were served very Cuban food
which I am not fond of, rice and “frejoles” (black beans) but thankfully there
was some stewed lamb and tomatoes and cucumber. 
Also on offer was fried sweet potato and fried banana called “tostones” which
I hesitated to eat because of the enormous amount of calories they would have.</span></div>

reminded me of India as many things do. The main difference is that there are
no cows or goats in the street. Otherwise Cuba seems nearly as poor, the

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">By the bike there was a food market and we went in to
have a look at how Cubans buy their food. I should add that under this communist
regime, people are given coupons for the basics but that anything else has to
be paid for at extortionate prices.  The
food from the coupons only lasts them 10 days though. There were only eggs and
chicken for sale and not much more.  The
market was pretty awful and I felt so privileged with the wonderful
supermarkets we can go to in Europe and, which if Cubans saw would realise what
a rip off their regime is.</span></div>

called an “almedrón” or “colectivo” which seems to be the main public transport
here after the very old buses “guaguas”. Our ride cost approx. 40 euro cents each.
Once back in “Vedado” where we staying we exchanged euros for “cucs” and Cuban
pesos.  I have still to understand why
there are two types of currency here.  It
seems strange and no one is really able to explain it.  One cuc is the equivalent to 24 pesos or 1
euro. I Cuban peso is about 4 or 5 euro cents.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

able to send whatsapps to the girls at home. They had been worried at no news
from us. Later we were joined by Toño and Eladio and then walked home. I was told,
as we were leaving that nearly every block of flats here has a sort of
government warden who spies on all the neighbours, just as there were in the
old USSR.  We also heard from the owner
of our small hotel that after Fidel Castro died, all the inhabitants were
obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the regime.  Yes this is still a communist country.  However, according to one man we spoke to in
the street the next day, he confided that the majority of people here are
anti-Castro and are waiting for Raúl to die and that only then can real change
come.  Yes it is communist as I said
before but it is a different sort to that in the old USSR, China or North
Korea.  It is a Latin American Caribbean
communism which I suppose helps as people are more relaxed and also smilingly
resigned to how the country is run.  I
don’t think I could live here for more than about a month although Havana is
charming and enticing if you are a tourist.</span></div>

game consoles.  You see them playing
football in on the pavements, although the national sport as I said is baseball

food. The food was very disappointing.  I
had lobster which tasted like rubber. 
Just as we were finishing, Marta, my niece and her husband, Ministro had
arrived – many people were coming from Spain for Miguel and Claudia’s wedding.
They were just as shattered as we had been the night before when we
arrived.  We all went to bed early after
having sprayed our rooms with insect repellent. We had been told there were all

would work as mosquitos seem to love my white skin.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

conversation with the Cuban waiter I mentioned above, the one who said everyone
was waiting for Raul Castro to die.  We
asked him how he and his fellow Cubans could bear the regime with its shortages
and he told us how most people pirate a connection to tv from abroad adding
that in Cuba there were only 3 channels, Fidel 1, Fidel 2 and Fidel 3 which had
us in stitches.  He asked us whether we
knew the drink “Cuba Libre” which means in English “Free Cuba” which he said
was a lie as there is no freedom whatsoever. Funnily enough our next
destination was the Hotel Cuba Libre which houses the Real Madrid Football Fan
club here and where we would be picked up by Miguel.  In the reception I was able to use my
internet card for a minute or two to send photos and messages to the girls.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

It is run by a Catalán woman called Lola and I have to say we had the

at a recommended Italian restaurant in the rich area called Miramar.  The waiter we spoke to in the Obispo street
said that is where the people live who have access to things normal Cubans do
not. So you see communism is as it is everywhere. Those running the system have
everything whilst the normal population has nothing.  It reminds me of the famous phrase in George
Orwell’s Animal Farm when describing the pigs: “All are equal but some are more
equal than others”. That is a very apt description of how things are here.</span></div>

There are no luxury cars here, no BMWs, Mercedes, etc but I did spy one Audi in
the Miramar district.  A table was booked
for us at the highly recommendable <a href="http://www.havanainsider.com/la-carboncita/">La Carboncita</a> and although we weren’t hungry

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Hailing an “almendrón” taxi going back was something
of an adventure as they were few and far between and people were jumping the
queue.  In the end we found a normal taxi
and haggled the tariff down from 15 to 5 cucs. 
It was difficult to tell the driver where to take us as the streets here
are run on an alphabetic and numeric system a bit like the American one. Ours
was on street “E” in between numbers 13 and 15. 
There are no name signs on the streets as there are in most parts of the
world and to see them you have to look for an engraved stone on the ground
which is very confusing. The big avenues do have names though, such as Avda de
los Presidentes.  The most impressive one
is Havana’s 5</span><sup style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">th</sup><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"> Avenue full of security posts and traffic
lights.  There are very few traffic
lights or zebra crossings and you often have to risk your life crossing the big
avenues. I should add that the old cars do not have seat belts either, another
potential risk.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">The sea was rough and the red flag was flying.  It was also a bit cold so hardly anyone went
in the water.  However when the sun came
out, the first person to go in was Ministro, Marta’s sporty husband.  I followed suit. But first I had to find
somewhere to change into my Marks and Spencer bathing costume.  I did so under a group of coconut palm trees
and in a hurry too, lest one of them fell on my head whilst changing.
Thankfully none of them did although there were plenty on the ground. The water
was warm but the sea so choppy and the waves so big it was impossible to
swim.  Once dried with one of the hotel
towels I had sneaked out, we went for a long walk on the beach where we had to
be careful to navigate around the jelly fish.  At around 5 our vintage cars came to drive us
home.  We drove past the Malecón
promenade and were amazed to see the huge waves crashing over the stone wall
and wetting us.  I was the one who bore
the brunt of it as the window on my side wouldn’t wind down hahah.</span></div>

Yep, Lola K, across the road from their flat.

what I was most interested in was not the food but her tiny 3 month old
miniature Fox Terrier, Lian, which was snuggled in a box in a corner of the
kitchen.  I just adored the puppy and
spent a lot of the night getting up from the table to go and see it. Here I am
holding the delightful creature.  I
wonder what Pippa would have thought hahaha.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

the newly operated open top tourist buses, a sight I was not glad to see in
Havana. Normally I wouldn’t be seen dead on one, but it was the only way we
could see the whole of the city.  For 10
euros a head we went on the one hour and 40 minute ride.  The views were good but we couldn’t hear a
word the guide said as the sound system was appalling. Perhaps the most
interesting sight we saw was the famous Plaza de la Revolución which we had
only seen at night.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We got off at a place we now know very well, Parque
Central.  Here we went to have a coffee
and a quick dose of slow internet at the imposing Hotel de Inglaterra.  By then it was lunch time and we had no plans
or reservations.  Instead of staying in
the centre we headed back on the slow bus to the area we are staying in, El
Vedado.  We had a half hour wait on the
bus itself due to the total lack of efficiency. 
Watching the driver Orlando and the nice woman guide getting ready to go
was a show in itself.  They were a
picture of the lack of efficiency here and we all got rather frustrated.  In the end we could only laugh at the
situation. You see, as I said before, everything is really slow here and either
you take it or you leave it hahaha.</span></div>

were the views of the Malecón promenade and city.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">The expensive lobster was tough, tasteless and
inedible and I declined to eat it.  In
lieu of the ghastly lump of thick, white and rubbery seafood, I ordered what
was called on the menu “filet mignon”. 
It turned out to be another lump of inedible meat.  I had asked for it to be underdone and
grilled and with a small salad.  It took
the inefficient restaurant more than an hour to prepare it and when it came I
took one look and sent it back to the kitchen. 
It was tough, sitting on a bed of cheese (I hate cheese) and swimming in
oil. In Cuba I heard, beef is virtually unknown and usually very tough so maybe
I shouldn’t have asked for it. The bill came to over 100 euros which is
incredibly expensive for here so I left the worst restaurant I had ever been
in, on an empty stomach and 100 euros poorer. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Our next appointment of the day was one we were all
looking forward to.  We were going to
have coffee at Toño and Eladio’s cousin Roche’s house where we to meet his
daughter Lecinia, a dentist, and his wife who is unfortunately immobile and in
a vegetative state and unable to communicate. 
However, her daughter and husband swear she can hear and knows what’s
going on. Roche is the son of Constante, Eladio and Toño’s grandmother,
Lecinia’s brother who left Montrondo for Cuba in 1920 never to return. However,
as you may have read in my blog, this summer his dream came true and he flew to
Spain to see his Father’s beloved village and meet our family. The six of us,
Toño, Dolores, Marta, Ministro, Eladio and I left our residence in search of a
taxi for 6 to take us to the far away neighbourhood of El Cerro.  So far, so good, we hailed a big classic car
in the nearby Avda de los Presidentes. The taxi driver had no idea how to get
there and frequently stopped to ask people the way.  Finallly we found our family’s humble
house.  Worried we would not find a taxi
to get back later, we agreed with the driver to pick us up from Roche’s house
at 6.30pm.  We were to learn later, once
again, that Cubans don’t always stick to their word hahaha.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On our way we were to see sights tourists don’t
usually get to see, more crumbling and dilapidated houses which were once
beautiful and lived in by rich owners but now inhabited by numerous families
unable to restore them.  Roche’s house
was small but obviously a luxury to live in and unaffordable to most Cubans.
However, as he had been one of Castro’s fighters and supporters of the
revolution he is well looked after by the regime and the house was a gift from
the state.  It was very humble in my
eyes.  In the lounge, overlooking
everything was a portrait of our family’s hero, Fidel Castro.  The family are staunch supporters of the
regime and our conversation with them was extremely interesting.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

he got to love us all during his visit to Spain.  We had got to love him too. He is a gentle
and kind man.  But it was his older daughter
Lecinia who captured our heart.  She was
named after Eladio’s and Roche’s grandmother and according to my husband looked
just like her.  She reminded me of my
sister-in-law, Pili.  She dedicates her
whole life to her parents, working as a dentist in the morning and then taking
care of her mother all of the time. I felt so sorry for her.  She is resigned to it and told me that she
had already lived her life and that it was her obligation now to care for her
parents.  That sort of dedication you
don’t often find in the “first world”. We invited her to the New Year’s Eve
party at our residence but she couldn’t go as she couldn’t leave her mother
alone for more than 10 or 15 minutes. 
All I could do was admire and feel sorry for her. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">At 6.30 we stepped out into the street hoping our taxi
would arrive but it never made an appearance. That’s when our odyssey
began.  We were far away from any taxi
route, it was dark and New Year’s Eve and we didn’t know how to find one.
Thankfully Roche guided us to a main road some 2km away, walking slowly with
his stick and we arrived at a big crossroad called Mónaco.  Here many people were waiting for taxis and
few appeared.  We needed a taxi for 6 and
it seemed to be mission impossible.  A young
Cuban man tried to help us and help us he did. 
He finally hailed down a shared taxi which was a very old army jeep and
supposedly illegal.  It was nearly full
but agreed to come back for us when it had dropped off the riders further
on.  In order to make sure it came back,
Ministro and I jumped in and joined the passengers in the dark and dingy old
vehicle.  It was one of those hilarious
moments when all we could do was laugh. 
On the ride we saw people in the street roasting a whole pig!  Thankfully the driver was true to his word
and once he had dropped off the rest of the passengers he did indeed drive back
to the Mónaco square to pick up the rest of our party.  All we could do on our drive back in the
priceless vehicle was laugh.</span></div>

started with lots of mojitos and loud live Cuban music.  I quickly showered and dressed and put make
up on for the first time.  It was a long
wait until midnight and I was tired but determined to stay awake until the New
Year.  The food was provided by the
residence cook and it was to be a barbecue. 
I was so hungry after the dreadful lunch I found the pork chops and rice
with beans delicious. It was funny to be spending New Year’s Eve in Cuba.  When we were starting to celebrate it was
already New Year’s Day in Europe and we had no means of connecting with our
daughters to wish them a Happy New Year. 
But we were not alone as we had part of our family there, Toño, Miguel,
Dolores, Mara and Ministro. And here we are enjoying the dinner at the party.</span></div>

the revolution we were told, although everyone here celebrates the New Year. We
went to our Cuban friends to connect to internet.  On this subject, let me tell you how internet
works or doesn’t work here.  There are
wifi zones, mostly at the big hotels, and this is where you have to have an internet
card which costs between 2 and 4 cucs each and lasts an hour.  It has a user name and code to connect.  You generally know where the wifi zones are because of the gathering of people glued to their phones like the one in the photo below.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">People have mobile phones here but without
data. That must mean that there is cellular infrastructure but without
data.  It’s all because the government
controls telephony and internet. Cuba really is behind the rest of the world
when it comes to mobile telephony. I was
told that each phone call costs 1 dollar!! This must be the most expensive
mobile phone system in the world.  I hope
that one day the wifi card system will be replaced by cheaper mobile data.</span></div>

for a walk again.  On our way into town
we decided to visit the imposing <a href="http://www.hotelnacionaldecuba.com/">Hotel Nacional</a> built in 1930 and which seems
to be a national reference. It is in fact one of the main national monuments in Havana.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

only showed us the main monuments but gave us a wonderful lesson in the history
of Cuba. I had no idea for example that the British had governed Cuba for one
year at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and that after the year the
Spanish exchanged Florida for Cuba and returned to power.  Not for long though. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">After it was dark we parted from the younger members
of the group who were off to La Fábrica a sort of discotheque, and went in
search of dinner. Finding somewhere decent to eat is difficult here as is
finding a taxi.  In the end we had a
lousy meal at the Hotel Sevilla where I found my internet card had run out and
there was nowhere to buy another. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The taxi we found to take us back was the dirtiest and
oldest I had ever seen. It took some finding as all public transport had been
suspended due to the preparations for the military parade the next day. I was
told it was to celebrate the arrival of Fidel Castro in Habana 59 years ago. The
worst thing about the car if you can call it that were the petrol fumes
invading its interior. We could hardly breathe. I wondered at the state of the
lungs of its driver, poor man.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Once back at our residence, Rafa, the night warden,
had arrived.  He always sits outside in
the garden throughout the night as does Pablo the man he takes turns with.  Their shifts are from 7 in the evening until
7 in the morning. Rafa is a young teacher of computer studies.  He told me that as a teacher he earned 16
cucs a month!  However as a hotel guard or
warden he is paid 120, considered an excellent wage here.  The owner of Rent In Vedado pays all his
staff the same wage and even gives them a paid holiday, something unheard of
in Cuba.  No wonder they are a happy bunch
of people. Rafa has no car and has to use public transport, the guagua
buses.  However the next day, 2<sup>nd</sup>
January, the day of the armed forces, they would not be circulating and he told
me he would have to walk home, some 15km! 
I felt so sorry for him.  I asked
him why people didn’t use bicycles here as a cheaper way of transport but they
apparently cost some 900 euros each, so again are unaffordable.  Oh this way of life so frustrates me.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

had to be up early the next day as Miguel had organised an excursion to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi%C3%B1ales">Viñales</a>
for the whole group which is a 3.5 hour drive from Havana. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

here to transport our group on our trip to Viñales, a tobacco area in the
countryside.  Viñales near Pinar del Rio
and on the “tobacco route” is only some 140km away.  I asked why we couldn’t take a train which I
thought would be faster.  I learned there
were none.  It seems there are trains,
especially to Santiago de Cuba but it takes 8 or more hours to get there.  The railway line in existence was built by
the Spaniards to transport the sugar cane but seems not to have been developed
since.  On the subject of sugar cane, it
is one of Cuba’s main sources of income together with rum, from the cane,
cigars and tourism.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

and nearly all of Miguel’s friends and wives who had come for the wedding like
us.  It was the perfect moment for a
group photo and here we all are standing next to one of the cars, owned, by the
way, by a Spanish taxi driver, Alfonso, who had come to Spain for love but also
because of the crisis.  From Avila near
Madrid, he was to be our driver. He told us the old 1949 chevrolet car he has
cost him 20.000 cucs (the same in euros).<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We set off in great spirits. It was a lovely warm
day.  We drove out of Havana passing the
affluent Miramar district where many of the Embassies are.  From Miramar we passed the richest area of
all Cuba which I think is called Sibone. 
Alfonso pointed out the Spanish ambassador’s residence which was
imposing. The houses here were huge, well-kept and looked like palaces. It is
in this area you find what is known as zero Zone, the huge area where Raúl
Castro lives.  It was heavily guarded and
fenced and we were told the Castros hardly ever left it.  Rumour has it there is even an airport
there.  So much for equality from
Castro’s communism I thought.  I was once
again reminded of George Orwell’s Animal Farm. </span></div>

was in dire need of repair.  Alongside us
rode horse and carriages and “collective” lorries.  People lined the hard shoulder hailing them

the ride.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

road to Pinar del Río and the “motorway” to Havana in daylight.  It was a nightmare of a journey which seemed
never ending.  Thankfully we stopped off
some 60km from the capital.  I was amazed
to see all the cars park on the hard shoulder and that we had to cross the
motorway to get to the café and loos. 
The loo is worth mentioning and was perhaps the worst I had seen.  With no running water, the toilet attendant
had to pour a bucket of water into the loo after each person had gone.  The place, as you can imagine, was filthy.</span></div>

resellers sell them for 3.  It’s a
lucrative business for some Cubans who queue up every day to buy them and then
resell them.  Each person is allowed to
buy 3 at a time. The queue was orderly but endless and then suddenly out of
nowhere a security van arrived with armed police who came to collect the money
from the internet card firm Etecsa. 
Dolores and I preferred not to wait any more and finally bought 2 cards
from a delightful young Cuban woman who was 8 months pregnant.  We then went in search of a wifi spot which
we soon found in a nearby park. Here we were able to touch base with friends

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">It was a lovely ceremony conducted by Lola, the
restaurant owner and the couple’s friend. 
Miguel’s best friend “Cabra” spoke as did Claudia’s friends.  There was also to be an ancient wedding
ritual where the couple had to mix Spanish soil with Cuban soil into a jar they
were supposed to keep forever and if there were problems ever in their marriage
the idea was to shake the jar and start again. 
I found it delightful.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The piece de resistance of the wedding was music and
dancing.  The band was pretty famous or
rather the singer, Rae, was and the atmosphere created such good vibes that even I
danced and quite a lot too.  Oh how the
Cubans know how to dance.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It was very warm and the music a little too loud for
us “oldies”, thus we made a discreet exit at about 9pm.  I don’t know how long the wedding would go
onto but I guessed into the small hours of the morning, at least for the young
people.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We walked back to our residence, a haven of peace and
quiet, showered and got changed and sat outside in the garden for what would be
the last night for Eladio and I.  Toño
and Dolores would be going to the Keys (Santa Maria) the next morning for a few
days with the bride and groom and some of their friends while we would be
returning to Spain. I didn’t want to leave and would have loved to stay for
another week.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">So we went to be bed at 10pm!!  I was up on our last day, 4<sup>th</sup> Jan,
at 6.30. As I did every morning I had a cup of coffee and went into the garden
to chronicle my blog.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

time to enjoy more of Havana on our last day. 
Returning to Spain with us were my niece Marta and husband Ministro. After
saying our goodbyes, we got into a pink 1954 Chevrolet convertible car we had
hired to take us on a tour of the city. 
Our driver arrived on time and we were delighted with our upcoming
activity.  We immediately began taking
photos like the one below. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">At 6.30 pm. our polite Cuban taxi driver came to take us to the airport.  He came in his 1940 car. We learned from him that he had studied to be a telecoms engineer but only earned 20 cucs (the same in euros) per month.  So when he inherited his grandfather's car, he became a taxi driver. People are educated here, yes, but they cannot earn a living with the jobs available.  It's so sad. Our driver told us he was praying for change once Raul Castro stands down in 2018.  So am I.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Our wait at the airport was long and frustrating.  The controls were ok, what was not were the loos (ghastly) and the cafeteria which seemed to have run out of everything even bread.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Thus it was bliss to get on our Iberia flight and fly towards civilization again hahaha. It was to be 9 hours long and this time I slept thank goodness. Oli was there to meet us when we arrived on Thursday 5th January at midday.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">It was great to be home and eat a nice Spanish lunch prepared for us by Salud.  We decided not to go to sleep until the evening to avoid the jet lag and that's what we did.  I even went shopping with Oli for food for Kings' Day today.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">So here I am writing again from home on Kings' Day in the morning, still with much of my mind on Cuba. It was a fascinating trip and I'm glad we went. I do hope you enjoy reading about it.  Hopefully things will improve there for the people.  I am praying they will.</span></div>
