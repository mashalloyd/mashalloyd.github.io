Notice too the smiles on our faces. We have our lives back again. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">Good morning all.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Well, what can I say? Goodbye Felipe Turover. I have great news this week. Our unwanted squatter finally left. He did so on Wednesday 30th but it was touch and go until we were finally rid of him. Our lives felt as if they were on hold when he stopped paying and we filed a court case against him on 19th November - nearly 6 months ago Now we can turn the page and start a new chapter in our lives. Now we have many reasons to smile. One of them this week was when I said goodbye to Covid. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Just after publishing my blog last Sunday I took a lateral flow test. I expected to still test positive but was delighted to see just one line on the C meaning I was negative. Wow! That was quick as I had first tested positive the Wednesday before. It gave me an immediate high.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhnEzV98YoOoUM5QLZF3pVdKjImBhHZFdWtkTbKcsQaNZFmlL5DZeomGleS9oqBLVqZqksms6uTGMgHp5yx2neA7xi9kuiucs97JFz_S479xbwGY3GisosqGBrWU6Jk577XGchscwIzCbPNk3M60a43Sif_g-NRzU5jCqk94bEF36Gj0LSd5Js/s1440/Sunday%20test%20negative.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhnEzV98YoOoUM5QLZF3pVdKjImBhHZFdWtkTbKcsQaNZFmlL5DZeomGleS9oqBLVqZqksms6uTGMgHp5yx2neA7xi9kuiucs97JFz_S479xbwGY3GisosqGBrWU6Jk577XGchscwIzCbPNk3M60a43Sif_g-NRzU5jCqk94bEF36Gj0LSd5Js/w400-h400/Sunday%20test%20negative.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>I tested negative last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">I was so relieved and pleased at the same time. Sunday was the day the clocks went forward which always pleases me too so I had two reasons to be happy that day. Thus I suggested to Eladio that instead of going on our usual walk through the woods, that we walk to the local shopping centre and have a cup of coffee and a "porra" (literally police like truncheon - because of its shape). A porra is like a thick churro (the Spanish fritter usually eaten with thick chocolate). It was to do something different and also celebrate that the virus had finally left my body. I still had cold like symptoms but I was rid of it and it had been very mild. Here I am making the victory sign like dear old Churchill. I had to make a conscious effort not to do it the other way round which you all know, if you are from the UK, means something very rude.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQNPCQPFAY-l7n3kT9g4s74noviX2MRshrApF__eW7uNE10T3tORsWBvMpi5vlD75IrzDF98syVaFy4EOCvRu1bSd4NGymVozAru_nXvearVXsLoASlcoDt0WjjnLEci_9Dx_g9RymbcT1k-4t0zlCTpKVtULmqNYja7GvehFTY1WBVoyR0Og/s1440/Sunday%20v%20sign%20coffee.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQNPCQPFAY-l7n3kT9g4s74noviX2MRshrApF__eW7uNE10T3tORsWBvMpi5vlD75IrzDF98syVaFy4EOCvRu1bSd4NGymVozAru_nXvearVXsLoASlcoDt0WjjnLEci_9Dx_g9RymbcT1k-4t0zlCTpKVtULmqNYja7GvehFTY1WBVoyR0Og/w400-h400/Sunday%20v%20sign%20coffee.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Celebrating with a cup of coffee after beating Covid</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Just having beaten Covid gave me renewed and positive energy and I immediately felt better. Psychology has so much to do with ones mood. In order to be free of it completely though I would have to take another test the next day. I did and it was negative again. Two recurrent negative tests are required to demonstrate you are Covid free. I was happy to be able to say "goodbye Covid". Let's see how long the immunity lasts. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Monday</b> came, just 2 days before Felipe Turover was supposed to leave if he was to respect the court settlement. We still had our doubts. We expressed them on our walk that morning in the sun, for once. Here are Eladio and Pippa on our walk that day. There are more and more signs of spring these days; more wild flowers and green leaves appearing on some of the trees.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfwvkfWXViqi_TLrC2FrGkiBM71K2bmGJNRfc78iObUjTY8e2WxRB_Of8XU53Gb3_48XvN2qVuyGYRm74_8fE-QHnmPBBtoCmKB59TCI5dDfzivm_jgS2Dec-5zeX20Ba6TmY5Cd4bPO3SHdMzw_nMeqn21_g9v-B6tjHmnFzbz_TS7nGDPfQ/s2947/Monday%20walk%20E%20and%20P.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfwvkfWXViqi_TLrC2FrGkiBM71K2bmGJNRfc78iObUjTY8e2WxRB_Of8XU53Gb3_48XvN2qVuyGYRm74_8fE-QHnmPBBtoCmKB59TCI5dDfzivm_jgS2Dec-5zeX20Ba6TmY5Cd4bPO3SHdMzw_nMeqn21_g9v-B6tjHmnFzbz_TS7nGDPfQ/w234-h400/Monday%20walk%20E%20and%20P.jpg" width="234"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio and Pippa on our walk on Monday morning</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was a pleasant morning for us; not so for the people of Ukraine. The war continued we are now into the 6th week since the invasion on 24th February. The Ukranians are resisting but at great cost. 4 million have left the country. Previously Moscow had stated the first part of the "operation" was over and they would concentrate on the Donbas region. I was horrified to read of stories of Russian soldiers raping Ukrainian women. There again I should not be surprised as that is just what they did in Germany in WW2. Disgusting! The Russians were not happy that day after Biden said off script Putin should not be running the country. He said what we all feel but no else dares to say.  His words may have fueled the war more though as Russia intensified its attacks and did not let refugees escape through humanitarian corridors. There are 160.000 people trapped in the port town of Mariupol with no water, electricity, power of any sort and not to mention food. Meanwhile we heard that the oligarch Abramovich had been a victim of poisoning when taking part in peace talks in Kyiv. That does not surprise me; not that I am a great fan of the oligarch who is now obviously out of favour with Putin. As to peace talks well I wonder whether they will do any good as Ukraine has too much to lose in order for the Russian troops to disengage. Some people are predicting a divided Ukraine, a bit like North and South Korea. I sincerely hope not. The only way out that I  can see is the fulfilled wishes of Biden for Russia to be rid of Putin. That, though, can only happen at the hands of his own people like it did with Tsar Nicholas II and at the moment they are gagged. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Life continued peacefully here with our own Russian spy, Felipe Turover, still here. He went out that day and we took the opportunity to go into "his" room, mostly to measure the bathroom curtains which were disgusting, so as to order some new ones for when we are rid of him. All his stuff was there; one man and all his possessions. I wondered how on earth he would remove them all and where he would take them. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I didn't have much time to ponder that afternoon as at 4.30 I had to pick up little Elliot from the nursery. It's our turn this week to lend a hand as Miguel was working from 11 am to 11 pm. I love picking up my little grandson. He is so happy to see me and I just love scooping him up in my arms. In that moment there are no thoughts of Covid, the war or our unwanted KGB spy, just sheer love. I took him home after figuring out how to fasten him into his new car seat - baby paraphernalia is so complicated these days - actually I had to ask a young mother to show me (hahaha). We went straight to his home where Oli and Juliet were waiting. So I had some quality time with my daughter and grandchildren. Next week Oli will be back at work and will be taking Juliet to the nursery at the RTVE premises. She needed a photo for the nursery files and I had to hold Juliet for her to take it. I tickled her a bit to make her smile and  it worked. That was not hard as she is a very smiley sort of baby. Here she is chuckling for her portrait photo.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEggGbdBhhFHMQVOZ0cA_YAXoly_siJ8YoB3Q6y1aJbnxNd7nc9LZfteQKEqkVGpy9gRIJ7DPqJi-bs8nO7S9kzoPZG0XvA8Ph_RpKt8MAabIImo_G6PCAQLduSuAo_G3lw1Kzoh5DpDP72iA-wJxOCVpnFsldl4y5KQ3VbglrQyoMmUjjX-Rbc/s2016/Monday%20Juliet%20photo%20for%20nursery.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEggGbdBhhFHMQVOZ0cA_YAXoly_siJ8YoB3Q6y1aJbnxNd7nc9LZfteQKEqkVGpy9gRIJ7DPqJi-bs8nO7S9kzoPZG0XvA8Ph_RpKt8MAabIImo_G6PCAQLduSuAo_G3lw1Kzoh5DpDP72iA-wJxOCVpnFsldl4y5KQ3VbglrQyoMmUjjX-Rbc/w225-h400/Monday%20Juliet%20photo%20for%20nursery.jpg" width="225"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Juliet's nursery photo - smiling with my hands round her</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Both children behaved quite well. I love to see Elliot playing happily by himself with all his cars, animals and lots of little people from his favourite cartoons; especially Lady Bug, Fireman Sam and Paw Patrol. I left at around 7.30 on time for dinner at home with Eladio and took a photo of the peaceful scene before I left.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6YveraVGLfJhOeRhKS349mwSWSFcusUVnW2TdW8lc7GE0Gb-8XMHpcm_9wq-T10z4r7uoyhYJ38PUr7IrKAPMqbbwQ5p_ew3Cy87_7YqnFgjZSpApk_gfyQL8Tge4qByfV3ACtDqBEf7TwGNFT4G4j6mEB82aJfWLqdI5veXJYE41LzrJrQg/s4032/Monday%20children%20peaceful.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi6YveraVGLfJhOeRhKS349mwSWSFcusUVnW2TdW8lc7GE0Gb-8XMHpcm_9wq-T10z4r7uoyhYJ38PUr7IrKAPMqbbwQ5p_ew3Cy87_7YqnFgjZSpApk_gfyQL8Tge4qByfV3ACtDqBEf7TwGNFT4G4j6mEB82aJfWLqdI5veXJYE41LzrJrQg/w400-h180/Monday%20children%20peaceful.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The children at their home on Monday evening. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">I loved the fact that it was still light when I got home, after the clocks went forward last Sunday. We had a frugal dinner - soup and fruit and some bread and were in bed by 8.30. That is early but we like to watch the TV from our great big bed.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The big news that day did not only come from Ukraine, it also came from Los Angeles where this year's Oscars were held last Sunday night. Any winners' news was totally eclipsed by a violent slap from Will Smith who would later win best actor award. He slapped the presenter Chris Rock (who I had never heard of) when the latter made a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett's baldness (alopecia). As soon as he heard the quip, the actor stormed onto the stage slapping the MC. He then went back to his seat and shouted out loud twice for Chris to "take his wife's name out of his f****** mouth). Wow what a moment. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh153xNy_LKuAoQuVLk1_QK8SpBgbxkvqTwzlnbINgVUJrCMLwVVVDvsAVbXYf0Q2CY-xMQU5rP20Q2SB9euDdgrrcKtf8YM_8LmyW93ioEShX2scoIMCIxD86Esgc7270Jb2Isn3On-BxWaFRWtQLe746YzBBC2c2SWIov_AUm2Z8iKbZ9StI/s700/Monday%20the%20Oscars%20slap.webp" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh153xNy_LKuAoQuVLk1_QK8SpBgbxkvqTwzlnbINgVUJrCMLwVVVDvsAVbXYf0Q2CY-xMQU5rP20Q2SB9euDdgrrcKtf8YM_8LmyW93ioEShX2scoIMCIxD86Esgc7270Jb2Isn3On-BxWaFRWtQLe746YzBBC2c2SWIov_AUm2Z8iKbZ9StI/w400-h225/Monday%20the%20Oscars%20slap.webp" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The moment Will Smith slaps presenter Chris Rock at last Sunday's Oscars</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">This was before he was handed the award for best actor. Physical violence is just unacceptable. I would have accepted his words from the stalls to defend his wife but not his violence. He later apologised but for me it's too late and he will go down in history for this one violent act. The Academy Awards people are looking at sanctions of some sort but frankly I think they should not stop short of withdrawing the award.  </div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Tuesday</b> dawned. In the UK the main news was the attendance of the Queen at the memorial service to celebrate the life of the late Duke of Edinburgh, her beloved husband who died last year when Covid restrictions only allowed 30 people to be present. It took place at Westminster Abbey where the Queen and Duke married 70 odd years ago. There was talk the Queen was too frail to attend but she looked ok to me when she walked in. She is 95 and soon to be 96 and stunned the world when she walked in accompanied by her son  the disgraced Prince Andrews. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgNWLA4vQNVaj6SSiaY3l3YTg6yfPXC8IQWHwo6gntvvWB6cDbE67_vwsfc6ScLBK7iBUZ8OoK1EAypzyViDXJN_CfAi-KYvVa6oui6iCYr0hGhOlPul8zovMO6dYNrLnJDx5JZ6H4SPTUatUnN18OORMqskaU-Sfy3I6Ct5iYA5W926sLeQnw/s1440/Tuesday%20The%20Queen.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgNWLA4vQNVaj6SSiaY3l3YTg6yfPXC8IQWHwo6gntvvWB6cDbE67_vwsfc6ScLBK7iBUZ8OoK1EAypzyViDXJN_CfAi-KYvVa6oui6iCYr0hGhOlPul8zovMO6dYNrLnJDx5JZ6H4SPTUatUnN18OORMqskaU-Sfy3I6Ct5iYA5W926sLeQnw/w369-h400/Tuesday%20The%20Queen.jpg" width="369"></img></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">That for me was not good PR but I suppose he is her son and she is her mother and of course she still loves him. This gesture sort of overshadowed news of the ceremony which was otherwise short, beautiful and just how the Duke wanted it.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">But most of the world  had eyes for the peace talks in Istanbul between Russia and Ukraine. I don't really like the fact that Erdogan, not a nice of piece of work, the Turkish President, is taking centre stage between the two sides. Abromovich appeared again after he had recovered from the supposed poisoning at one of the last talks. The Ukrainian delegation members were under strict instructions to drink nothing, eat nothing and touch nothing, less they too be poisoned; Russia's way of intimidating them.  There was timid good news from Turkey when it was announced that Russia would deescalate in Kiyv and concentrate on the Donbas. No one believes it though. Ukraine agreed again not to join Nato and it seems Russia has ceded on its enemy joining the EU. But this is all talk and peace is far away. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">On the home front Tuesday was a day of nerves, the day before Felipe Turover, our unwanted ex KGB operative who has been squatting in our house since October, was supposed to leave. I had my doubts but that morning our lawyer sent a document for us all to sign in which he had to  relinquish all rights to living in our house. He wrote to send me the same document telling me he agreed to it. But it was only  in the afternoon when he asked Lucy to open the gate, that I had  proof he was leaving when he took 3 big suitcases away. That was the sign. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Needless to say I could not sleep that night, thinking about life after his departure and all that he had done to us.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">D Day, 30th March, arrived and I awoke at 5.30 am. Writing now the whole day seems like one big blur. Our nightmare was about to be over but we couldn't believe it or take it in. I didn't know until he emerged from his room at around 10.30 am that he was really leaving. By then Oli had gathered quite a few camera crews from various TV stations (Telemadrid, Telecinco and Cuatro) who were waiting to witness his leaving. They had covered the story ever since it erupted thanks to the article published by Spain's top newspaper <a href="https://english.elpais.com/spain/2022-01-13/vacation-rental-nightmares-living-with-a-former-kgb-spy-in-the-room-next-door.html">El País</a>. If you have been following my blog you will know about our unwanted guest who turned into a squatter - not paying us since last September -  Felipe Turover, a supposed ex KGB spy, involved in the demise of Boris Yeltsin and rise of Vladimir Putin with a strong background of corruption and fame for being a serial liar and a swindler - not my words but they they turned out to be true during his stay with us. He emerged with all his luggage and wanted to sign the document our lawyers had prepared where he relinquishes all rights on the room he has occupied. I retorted, not until he was out in the street with all his luggage. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjtaP8QbMIJbnfB1uOtXLZItHTbXLYsFpxO68QMfVMgnM-w-hGaZlwkmP-Cty4EK9XjyP6KVRU6FzZTgpJOVwg1ncERcbseE8EykbqRMxPA1QH-ssVCB6Ovp78OYXMkKCZl82i4M_blYrTFdPWwZvfgr5CvKMPzUVRU8h-5KAefo5O1d6O0CbU/s4032/Wed%20Oli%20luggage.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjtaP8QbMIJbnfB1uOtXLZItHTbXLYsFpxO68QMfVMgnM-w-hGaZlwkmP-Cty4EK9XjyP6KVRU6FzZTgpJOVwg1ncERcbseE8EykbqRMxPA1QH-ssVCB6Ovp78OYXMkKCZl82i4M_blYrTFdPWwZvfgr5CvKMPzUVRU8h-5KAefo5O1d6O0CbU/w180-h400/Wed%20Oli%20luggage.jpg" width="180"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Olivia ready to film him leaving - some of his luggage on the landing outside "his" room.<br></br><br></br></i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">I went into the room to make sure he had taken his belongings. What a stink there was, not to mention the dirt and filth after the room not having been cleaned since last November. I can't begin to describe the bathroom. You don't want to know the details. I made him remove all his rubbish and we accompanied him outside.</div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There waiting for him were the TV cameras he hates so much. He had never reckoned upon our PR weaponry when he stopped paying and we took him to court. The campaign did not make him leave but it helped highlight the case - the outdated laws in Spain that protect delinquents like him. It also exposed him for who he was and helped accelerate the judicial process. Without the press no doubt our case would still be lying on the floor in a file at the local courts in that horrible suburban town of Móstoles. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiiqic0iLmwA3DVk26S-AMBwApdJn3Boq5Bg5VmVLlip_VgLddkTFqpTWKxK9t4a6TGoeFcEeKyQQ90IQHQrvyNKLmWob1knF6eReC4NAV_CdLCX2wjwlanFND1X31uv8oM9I2JKS5CcbofBZkUUsTq1He0h3aog60Qx97aDG-dSbeXquTIsf0/s4032/Wed%20F%20and%20press%20street.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiiqic0iLmwA3DVk26S-AMBwApdJn3Boq5Bg5VmVLlip_VgLddkTFqpTWKxK9t4a6TGoeFcEeKyQQ90IQHQrvyNKLmWob1knF6eReC4NAV_CdLCX2wjwlanFND1X31uv8oM9I2JKS5CcbofBZkUUsTq1He0h3aog60Qx97aDG-dSbeXquTIsf0/w400-h180/Wed%20F%20and%20press%20street.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Felipe outside hounded by the presss</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">The press asked him why he hadn't paid, was he really a KGB officer and where he was going. One of the things he said was that he would take us to court for slander and for "our lies".  That made us laugh. When I later saw some of the TV coverage one piece of news stuck out like a sore thumb. In one of the programmes a woman on the panel commenting on the case told viewers that coincidentally she knew his former girlfriend. She described how this woman had told her she was going out with a Russian spy and that he had told her that the house he lived in (ours) belonged to his parents (us)!! She went on to say that the girlfriend had told her that at Christmas he, Felipe, had given her one of my luxury branded scarves as a present. Really? I was tongue tied when I listened to that. If he stole one of my scarves, what else did he steal?</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, back to his departure.  He stood next to his luggage at the end of our street waiting presumably for a car. Meanwhile we all chatted animatedly, feeling happy. That's when we took the photo with the press that I have chosen to illustrated this week's blog.His photo made for a stark figure, someone at the end of the road literally.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhydBFoon840wjP9slgRI7Pazm-Y79l4mb5twiZPk_CBTZsi0JpmTZsrde4dd2S8nmpqRhv-5dp5w2U7_4TLba-4NGD5ySRzgWMul-2njYTyE4xroib8uDqizikqisoF4pTZZrTsv0MNdlGYNbBBdzcpWI2eeIHJrBIZ9ymM_nM--N6kuxeTXA/s4032/Wed%20lone%20figure%20with%20luggage.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhydBFoon840wjP9slgRI7Pazm-Y79l4mb5twiZPk_CBTZsi0JpmTZsrde4dd2S8nmpqRhv-5dp5w2U7_4TLba-4NGD5ySRzgWMul-2njYTyE4xroib8uDqizikqisoF4pTZZrTsv0MNdlGYNbBBdzcpWI2eeIHJrBIZ9ymM_nM--N6kuxeTXA/w180-h400/Wed%20lone%20figure%20with%20luggage.jpg" width="180"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>One man, at the end of the road, with his luggage.

Unfortunately the press following him lost him shortly after he left. He actually left in a Mercedes - he always did love luxury. It was a Cabify car - Spain's equivalent of Uber. He left saying to the press he had done no wrong!!!" . And that was it, he was finally gone.

If only we could have followed him.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">When the press left, it was all over. He had gone. Goodbye Felipe Turover. I hoped never to see him again but that would not be so as you will read later. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We all set about beginning on cleaning his room and later took tons of bedding and bathroom linen to the dry cleaners which will cost a pretty penny. We also washed the curtains and ordered new shower curtains to replace the disgusting ones which were black and full of mold. We have left the windows open ever since he left to get rid of the stench, a mixture of tobacco, strong incense and body smell. Ghastly.  Now it's nearly ready. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We decided we deserved a meal out as a celebration of his leaving.

At 7.30 my time I had an important phone call. It was with the Dean of Bradford Cathedral to arrange for a memorial service in England and to take my father's ashes to be buried next to my mother at the Charlestown Cemetery near Baildon. The Dean was a darling and fulfilled my wish. He had been in touch with my father's old school, Bradford Grammar School, and between them they proposed the date and day of 6th May at 10 am. Wow, that is now something to get my teeth into. I have a month to plan but lots of local support. Anyone reading this is absolutely welcome to join us that day to honour my father on his return to the country where he was born, the country he fought for in WW2. I could hardly sleep that night but not because of our nightmare squatter but because all sorts of ideas bubbling in my head for my father's sendoff in his home country. </div><div style="text-align: justify;">On <b>Thursday</b> morning the first thing I did was to book a cottage for us while in Yorkshire and get flights for us and the girls who will join us for a few days.  I did  all in that in the space of less than an hour. We shall be staying in the lovely village of Haworth, 10 miles from Bradford and the home of the famous Bronte sisters. It is going to be so special and I am very excited. I'm also loving the preparations. Juliet will also be coming as she cannot be separated from her mother who is still breastfeeding. I realised my granddaughter would need a passport so warned Oli.

We aimed to get there when it opened at 11 am so as to avoid the crowds. St .George's is where we had the funeral for my father and it was a pleasure to meet up again with Father Medhat who had officiated.

We were lucky we could get a table for two but we did and sat down to enjoy the sheer luxury of the moment.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiCyUiK0cnqG8ApQ5K1wWrzNMyueGiIZNMGwRdzYs6kN-EaXMscol3ugt1swhQk4QT7Zfca4H_MgRsLTotexBLYtMVjnWlP-pfa1py5bP6D7l4J35ABP68PH2e423Va9FHbrb7gBJaq9KM4Q7PqvvFu9uQdlGbcliBD8TpGlXlZnGL7NENtHRU/s4032/sat%20coffee%20and%20raspberrie%20tart.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiCyUiK0cnqG8ApQ5K1wWrzNMyueGiIZNMGwRdzYs6kN-EaXMscol3ugt1swhQk4QT7Zfca4H_MgRsLTotexBLYtMVjnWlP-pfa1py5bP6D7l4J35ABP68PH2e423Va9FHbrb7gBJaq9KM4Q7PqvvFu9uQdlGbcliBD8TpGlXlZnGL7NENtHRU/w400-h180/sat%20coffee%20and%20raspberrie%20tart.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our coffee and raspberry tarts</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiquHOe6y4mZ70lIPAvpHL87oXqjyCK5QpWEtupRPLjvJmSB6GbsRWvTEIiNZ7Iw5dGpvN0huFTskglRYC8s5IHSFu8gL4cQnfFW2zNWeh0qDZzMWIMUh4pL3l-quCLhRLmrHuHVT69mmyZGDic23knipm8mtGtBdEdvbh4DIiAtN4ev6nPW0U/s4032/Sat%20Balbisiana%20with%20D.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiquHOe6y4mZ70lIPAvpHL87oXqjyCK5QpWEtupRPLjvJmSB6GbsRWvTEIiNZ7Iw5dGpvN0huFTskglRYC8s5IHSFu8gL4cQnfFW2zNWeh0qDZzMWIMUh4pL3l-quCLhRLmrHuHVT69mmyZGDic23knipm8mtGtBdEdvbh4DIiAtN4ev6nPW0U/w400-h180/Sat%20Balbisiana%20with%20D.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Enjoying the moment</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Everything about the place is amazing and I could not resist taking some cakes and truffles home.

I took the metro to a station not far from home where I had left my car and I was home by 1.45 or so. Oli was in the throes of cooking a vegan dish - courgette lasagne made without pasta but with layers of courgette and textured soy protein as part of the stuffing. Not my favourite meal but I wasn't complaining as I didn't have to cook. I loved the cakes though.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">I spent the rest of the day and evening with Oli and the kids. They stayed for dinner and Miguel joined us. We made a splendid dinner (with real protein this time haha) but I was shattered at the end of the day.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Today Sunday will be another family day but let me tell you all about it in next week's post.
