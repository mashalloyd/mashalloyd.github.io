<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I hope you all
had a good week. Mine was fine, spiced with a trip to Barcelona on Monday and
Tuesday.  In my previous jobs I used to
travel a lot; sometimes as much as once a week and often to far off locations
such as Shanghai, Cape Town, Santiago de Chile, Mexico City, Marrakech, many
times to Helsinki or to Chicago and many other places.  These days, I am lucky if I get two or three trips
to Stockholm or somewhere else near or in the Nordics once a year as well as a
couple of trips to Barcelona and one to Santander.  The travelling was great and even if it was a
bit too much I have to admit I miss it sometimes which is why the trip for work
purposes to Barcelona this week was so special than it would have been
before.   I was attending a course on social media on the
Tuesday and on Monday I had a lunch date with two women journalist friends,
Carmen and Toñi who have set up a great new technology website for women.  It’s called “<a href="http://www.gadwoman.com/">gadwoman</a>” and I love it!. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">PHOTO WITH
CARMEN AND TOÑI</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Being hyperactive,
organized and a great lover of life, I planned the trip with care so as to cram
in as much as I could, both work and pleasure. 
I took an early high speed train which got me in to Sants Station in the
centre of Barcelona at midday.  I must
admit I enjoyed every moment of the ride, including a little bottle of red wine
at just after 10 in the morning with some forbidden nuts! From the station I
took a taxi to my favourite hotel, <a href="//draft.blogger.com/%20http://www.hotel1898.com/en/barcelona-spa-wellness.php?gclid=CPrYpdSUtKwCFZJc4QodRxM0Hg">1898</a>, on the Ramblas.  Once I had checked in and unpacked (oh yes I
even unpack even if I’m only staying one night!), switched my computer on and
connected to internet (can’t live without it), I was on my way to meet Carmen
and Toñi at <a href="tocbcn:%20http://www.tocbcn.com/">Toc Barcelona</a> nearby; Carmen’s choice.  In fact, most of the places on my list of favourite
restaurants in Barcelona are recommendations from her over the years.  I have known them both in their caliber as
technology journalists based in Barcelona for many years.  Many a press trip with them in my previous
job with Nokia served to forge our good relationship and we share many good and
interesting moments together.  Toñi reminded
me of one in particular.  It was on one
of my last trips which was to St. Petersburg after a day in or two in Finland, and
actually my first and only visit to Russia. 
She reminded me how I had to persuade the guide to visit a church and
how we finally managed it and how I shed quiet tears whilst lighting a candle
and praying at an icon whilst the astonished journalists looked on.  I later had to explain what visiting a church
in Russia actually meant to me with my Slav background. It was good to see Toñi
and Carmen again and I wish them lots of luck with their new project.  </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I walked back
to my hotel via the fashionable Born district which Carmen recommended.  Not for her the H+Ms and Zaras of Puerta del
Angel, Barcelona’s most commercial street.   However, just one look at a price label in
one of the shops in the Born, had me scuttling off to the global brand stores I’m
afraid.  At H+M I bought a lovely woolen
striped long cardigan and another one for Grainne who I was meeting that night,
for a fraction of what the dress I saw in the shop in the Born cost.  In any case it was nice to walk freely
through the streets of the old town, wondering to myself whether I felt like a
tourist or a local.  I suppose a bit of
both.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I had a dinner
date with Grainne later.  Those of you
who know me personally will know that she is a very dear old school friend who
lives in Badalona, on the outskirts of Barcelona and who I make a special
effort to see every time I go and this time was not going to be an exception.  You might wonder where her name comes from
and how it is pronounced.  Well it is of
Irish origin; both of her parents were from the Republic of Ireland.  As to how you say, it’s not easy.  You say: “Grawnia”!  Anyway I had made a reservation at the
legendary <a href="http://www.loscaracoles.es/index1.htm">Los Caracoles</a> just of the Ramblas, so a stroll away from my hotel.  As it was never recommended to me by Carmen or
anyone local and only by English friends it sounded suspiciously touristy.  It turned out to be so, offering paella, a
dish, which comes from Valencia and which no Spaniard would ever eat for dinner
as it is so heavy. It was full of tourists and touristy food and a Tuna group
came in singing corny Spanish songs such as “Amapola” which my Father actually
loves.  Having said all that, I can
understand why it is so popular, the food is good, the décor is great and even
better is the old time quality atmosphere the whole place emanates, as you go
up the stairs and past the huge open kitchen where the food is cooked in
public. In Madrid its counterpart would be Botin, just off the Plaza Mayor
which I have always admitted is touristy but loved.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">We had a great
dinner together as always, catching up on each other’s news and talking about
our respective families and friends.  Grainne
loved the cardigan dress I bought her. You will see in the picture illustrating this blog that I
was wearing mine for the occasion.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"> Afterwards we walked back to my hotel from
where Grainne was to take a taxi home and in that short stroll we realised just
what a dodgy place the Ramblas is.  It is
teeming with tourists but also with suspicious characters and it is overall a
dangerous place to be especially at night. 
One young man who was covered in piercings asked Grainne for some money
to which she replied she was out of a job. 
He commiserated with her as if they were in the same boat so to speak and it was a bizarre moment.  I only felt safe when I was back in the lobby
of the hotel.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">On Tuesday I
was up early for a scrumptious Dukan forbidden breakfast.  I had checked out by 8.30 and was on my way
to the IESE Barcelona Business School to register for <a href="http://es.hsmglobal.com/contenidos/charleneagenda.html">the social mediaconference</a>.  There, in the same queue for
registration I met Erika, Suzy’s school friend from early childhood at St.
Michael’s.   Erika, who is half Swedish,
is a clever and beautiful young lawyer who is fascinated with the world of
fashion.  So much so that she did a
master in fashion journalism with Conde Nast and is now working as a trainee
reporter for Vogue Spain.  It was a
lovely coincidence.  It was great to see
you there Erika.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The Social
Media conference was more like a one day long presentation by the same
person.  This was <a href="http://www.charleneli.com/">Charlene Li</a>.  I had never heard of her but she is supposed
to be big in social media and very influential in Silicon Valley but of course
I have never been there.  She is an
American Chinese woman probably in her 40s who knows her subject well but didn’t
really inspire me.  Maybe I was expecting
more or maybe I know enough about social media not to be surprised.  I spent the whole session on Twitter, tweeting
some of her sound bites or re-tweeting tweets from other people in the audience
who seemed more impressed.  I must say
the room was jam packed and there must have been some 400 people there.  The conference was so packed they ran out of
food after the first ten minutes at lunch and it felt like feeding time at the
zoo with people desperate for their share. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I took the
18.30 train home and it wasn’t till nearly 9pm that I was trailing my suitcase,
heavy handbag and pc up the drive and into our house.  It’s always great to be home. Whilst I was
away I had missed <a href="http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/programa/manana-primeras-nevadas/1243035/">Oli on the television </a>on Monday morning.  It had snowed in the mountains outside Madrid
and she had been sent to Navacerrada to cover the story.  Needless to say she left the house in normal
clothes and had to borrow gloves and a scarf from the producer.  You can see the clip in this link.  Whenever Olivia is on the television, or
rather, whenever she tells me she is going to be on, it’s still a novelty for
me and I get very happy and excited for her and tell all and sundry. Thus
Grainne saw her too and was suitably impressed as was Pili in León who watched it
in a bar in her coffee break with her work colleagues.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The next day,
Wednesday, was a holiday, the Almudena, the patron saint of Madrid.  That meant we were all at home for once.  I had to check out a restaurant for an event
in December, so took the family along with me as there seemed to be no other
free day in my agenda to do so.  The meal
was great and the restaurant fine and there and then I booked it for our event
on 1<sup>st</sup> December which will be to celebrate Yoigo’s fifth anniversary.  Fancy, five years in the market.  For me it seems like yesterday and here we
are now with nearly 3 million customers, 1000 shops and over 90% brand recognition
and going strong.  </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The weekend
has been quiet.  As Olga has the weekends
off, we have to look after my Father and cannot leave him alone in the house
for more than an hour or so.  That’s not
normally a problem though as there is usually one of us at home.  So on Saturday morning, after leaving lunch
ready, Eladio and I went off to Centro Oeste a shopping centre in nearby
Majadahonda, with the excuse of picking up his trousers from Massimo Dutti.  It was such a sunny day we decided to have a
little something at a bar called La Gitana where we had been with Adele and
Bernard recently.  Later in Centro Oeste,
we got more than Eladio’s trousers, I can tell you; this time a furry coat and
striped woolen dress from Zara.  I can
only admit that I have far too many clothes. 
My excuse is that I making up for all the years I couldn’t buy any
because of my previous figure.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">That night I
wore the new dress (yes you’ve noticed I like stripes) to dinner with Eladio at
La Alpargatería. The girls stayed in as they had guests for dinner, so we
decided to go out at the last moment. 
Here I am wearing it on table number seven, our favourite.  </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Today, Sunday,
was another quiet sunny day with not much to report.  I made a lovely roast chicken in the morning
to the sound of British hymns from Spotify on my pc in the kitchen.  I was listening to “Immortal, invisible, God
only wise which I adore and Olivia and Eladio thought I was listening to
Christmas carols!  There and then I was
so moved listening to my collection of hymns that I decided that when I die I
would like to have them played at my funeral ah and that I would want the
service to be held in an Anglican Church. 
I told Olivia, there and then just in case it never occurs to me to tell
anyone before the event.  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Well I’m not
going to end on the note of my funeral, that’s for sure.  So what else is there of interest to report
this week that I haven’t  included
above?  Yes, I know, I’ve changed my
mobile phone and not only that, I’ve changed brands.  I’ve stopped using my fancy Samsung Galaxy S
because the battery wasn’t lasting me more than a morning, even after getting a
new one.  So what am I using now you may
ask?  Nothing fancy, the HTC Desire
S.  It’s an ordinary Android phone but the
battery lasts more than the iPhone or the Galaxy and it works perfectly.  This time I’ve gone for functionality rather
than brand and I think I’ve made the right decision.  For the time being I am delighted with it.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The only other
thing I could report on is politics and as you know I’m not keen on the
subject.  However I am bombarded with it
in the Spanish news.  One good piece of
news is that Berlusconi has finally stepped down, rather like a dictator and
everyone seems to have heaved a huge sigh of relief in Europe.  And in Spain the news is dominated by the up
and coming general elections on 20<sup>th</sup> November.  The two candidates, Rubalcaba from the
socialist party and Rajoy from the conservative party just do not inspire me as
I guess they don’t inspire many people here.  In any case as I am not a Spanish subject I
cannot vote but will be looking on with interest to see if whoever wins is able
to get Spain out of the crisis, and improve the unemployment figures, the
highest in Europe.  That does interest me
