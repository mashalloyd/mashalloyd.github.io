How have you all been? If you read last week's blog post, you will know that we started this year's anniversary holiday in Galicia and  were then going to Oporto for 4 nights. We had also planned to end our trip in El Cuetu. Plans changed when Suzy came home this week so we aren't going to Asturias.  Asturias is always there, Suzy isn't and we hadn't seen her since May. Before heading home, we have to spend tonight in Montrondo, a 4.5h drive,  as Eladio has to sign some papers with his siblings in León tomorrow. When that is over we shall hit the road again, back to Madrid. I can't wait to see Suzy. We've had a great time but it's now time to go home. </p><p>What a week it has been. Last Sunday was 21st August, our 39th wedding anniversary. It may not be a significant number, like a 25th or 50th, but who knows how long we will be together. Thus we must celebrate every year or even every day as my friend Sandra suggested. She is right. </p><p>We had no plans for that day apart from the anniversary dinner so after breakfast we wandered out for our morning walk. We took the opposite path to A Guarda which would take us to the little port of O Passaxe. The beginning of the walk was just as beautiful as the other one. Here is Eladio posing for my camera to remember the moment. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqwnTA_UpjOilEv1TIEKRzdqA42Sj72UdKitQ82IiY3QFZXGrqpa2ktdc7u8qVQ7B4gH2KPUQj5AddGA_x2mhSeJc_eb7J5HUVEhJC06YuKe7OHjHVs1kuyb4fotrgC3oNpiprCC95VWjDBmpQfF54dTEutZ8hBjUdyJbEptgNJet41mnkGdo/s4032/1%20E%20walkway.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqwnTA_UpjOilEv1TIEKRzdqA42Sj72UdKitQ82IiY3QFZXGrqpa2ktdc7u8qVQ7B4gH2KPUQj5AddGA_x2mhSeJc_eb7J5HUVEhJC06YuKe7OHjHVs1kuyb4fotrgC3oNpiprCC95VWjDBmpQfF54dTEutZ8hBjUdyJbEptgNJet41mnkGdo/w180-h400/1%20E%20walkway.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio on our walk last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">Once the wooden path way finished we walked along a dusty road which took us to the port from where there used to be a passenger ferry to the other side of the estuary to Caminha in Portugal.  We knew that taxi boats were available and were lucky to find one.

I took a video too which you can see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8lr0lLN3kE">here</a>. It was a wonderful day to be out sailing although the journey was short. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">Julio dropped us off at the far end of this semi walled town (2500 inhabitants) which seemed thriving, clean and very pretty, much more so than the villages in Spain on the other side I thought to myself. There was a sort of antiques fair or jumble sale going on in a park which we visited for a bit of fun. From there we walked along the main street which seemed festive and was full of shops that were open. We bought a panama hat for Eladio who had forgotten his and then I persuaded him to buy some green shorts which looked great when he tried them on. We then reached the main square which was very pretty but quite crowded. Here we sat at a cafe and watched the world go by. The coffee was good but we didn't have a "pastel de belem" (typical Portuguese pastry) as we were going to have lunch earlier than usual. Below is a photo of the main square and the monuments there such as the clock tower. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXHTeu24k3LFwmQMZzBIgWwaOHssv2aRwVnN6ANwsD-8NCPFOUEzzjbqhXiQkXHpaYx_hSnCmm0FN9onPP13K_JR5RuTAgho71xLdMVFpTEBuoQNpZktcKin6r4rUBiPi4fFmM4Ty33Y6dcytTk1AIsSQbZWVgsGLHuqgJiLtnQs7uIl-az-s/s4032/4Cafes%20main%20square%20Caminha.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXHTeu24k3LFwmQMZzBIgWwaOHssv2aRwVnN6ANwsD-8NCPFOUEzzjbqhXiQkXHpaYx_hSnCmm0FN9onPP13K_JR5RuTAgho71xLdMVFpTEBuoQNpZktcKin6r4rUBiPi4fFmM4Ty33Y6dcytTk1AIsSQbZWVgsGLHuqgJiLtnQs7uIl-az-s/w400-h180/4Cafes%20main%20square%20Caminha.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The square where we had coffee in Caminha last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfD6Q9Ie5AhXOS-RtI5heAEdClX0FZmyiOMugX5Oamy_GGEBgpj_GIdAkVQ5JWCxDuXqL7cytJK18tgBeZNeXexo85bYVYlAZhnz-A6ffQ7qcHUZ7jiF18b7w0muDiybqN_cwrDAkrLfK3-ubejwt6_81aK4GZVBmy0kKTNfcOdwBjb18uY9Q/s4032/5%20monuments.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfD6Q9Ie5AhXOS-RtI5heAEdClX0FZmyiOMugX5Oamy_GGEBgpj_GIdAkVQ5JWCxDuXqL7cytJK18tgBeZNeXexo85bYVYlAZhnz-A6ffQ7qcHUZ7jiF18b7w0muDiybqN_cwrDAkrLfK3-ubejwt6_81aK4GZVBmy0kKTNfcOdwBjb18uY9Q/w400-h180/5%20monuments.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The main square in Caminha</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We decided to have lunch in Caminha. I came up with one of the best known restaurants in town, "<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g644298-d4471523-Reviews-Muralha_de_Caminha-Caminha_Viana_do_Castelo_District_Northern_Portugal.html">Muralha de Caminha</a>". We didn't have a reservation so were lucky to get a table. I later realised why we got one. I hadn't remember that it is an hour earlier in Portugal so we were sitting down at 12.30 but that was fine by us. We both wanted our favourite Portuguese dish, bacalhau à brás. I was gutted to see it wasn't on the menu. That's when the waiter told me in Portuguese that it was on the menu and pointed at it. It read: "bacalhau dourado". It turns out it is the same dish with two names. That was good to know. Even better was to taste it. I make this dish at home but it's nowhere near as good as what we had in Caminha last Sunday. <br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaCUrBoIACQFcHGefalySJzubHrd0NGFeIcL8c-oVT1HggU9FJjugbkfRcCWWnMmzpV05FeHHBanySjlgGMUOopMgILIqibBlKSX8OzPS3sJsYh6GMWtW04jkTZXJtG0_ihBFIbqJN3bZ1oyiSn1C-J-SalDNT0gB1E-dGRsxtQBNb3oFqH2A/s3040/6.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="141" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaCUrBoIACQFcHGefalySJzubHrd0NGFeIcL8c-oVT1HggU9FJjugbkfRcCWWnMmzpV05FeHHBanySjlgGMUOopMgILIqibBlKSX8OzPS3sJsYh6GMWtW04jkTZXJtG0_ihBFIbqJN3bZ1oyiSn1C-J-SalDNT0gB1E-dGRsxtQBNb3oFqH2A/w400-h141/6.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>This Portuguese dish comes by two names: bacalhao dourado and bacalhau à brás</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We ate about a third of it as we weren't very hungry and took the rest home in a doggy bag to have at our hotel.  It was a bit of an adventure to find a taxi boat to take us across the river/estuary/sea. We made our way to the other side of the town, where Julio told us the Portuguese taxi boats ran but saw none. Two Austrian girls were also searching  and found one. But this time it was a speed boat and dammit did it go fast; far too  fast for me. At least we were wearing life belts. The boat literally dropped us off on the beach from where we said goodbye to our Austrian fellow passengers. <br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8hGMnRIQNlxJe6fVUVCKML6bEK2D50dMIJRANE6DmQ-83WkqHjP_3czGAx9b6H2rDMbMRRujndPeBKTumsDJCP23TyC7oe7C8HU_dqrFRBXjijoTf_pZdATRJDdEZxvXC9Rv5lHer13kGLfqoAJ7Xg10XR8OZDtBPdOGnui62s0Pyq3C4A5g/s4032/7boat%20back%20to%20molino%20hotel.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8hGMnRIQNlxJe6fVUVCKML6bEK2D50dMIJRANE6DmQ-83WkqHjP_3czGAx9b6H2rDMbMRRujndPeBKTumsDJCP23TyC7oe7C8HU_dqrFRBXjijoTf_pZdATRJDdEZxvXC9Rv5lHer13kGLfqoAJ7Xg10XR8OZDtBPdOGnui62s0Pyq3C4A5g/w400-h180/7boat%20back%20to%20molino%20hotel.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our speed boat taking us back to our beach from Caminha last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>The girls were doing the "Camino" - the Portuguese route from Oporto to Santiago (about 250km) and to do so had to cross the sea like us. I wished them a "buen camino" which is what "pilgrims" say to each other. I also said goodbye in Spanish: "adios" and explained it meant "to God". They were happy to hear that and then I said a few words in German - I do know a smattering and then they were off. They left me wondering if one day we will do "El Camino". We should. It must be a great experience.<div><br></br></div><div>It was good to be back in our spacious room and shower and rest and get ready for dinner in our finery. I wore the dress I had bought for the wedding we went to on 1st July. Dammit I noticed that my girth had widened and the waistline was slightly tighter. I must stop eating so much but now is not the time to start a diet is it? I had chosen a supposedly romantic little place with good food according to the reviews. It was called "Casa de la Abuela" - "grandma's house" - not quite the right name for a restaurant for an  anniversary dinner hahaha, but at least it was romantic. I got one of the waiters to take some photos and of course this week's feature photo had to be of us that night, along with one of our time in Oporto.  And here are more from that evening: <br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZ-YP1D_XZL0a3xL-S-4Dc7XNPa-j-excxG0VxiOnZmc3mf1ABIGU0dGUP0Jd0B1THys4ekhUmsgPS6SgzXQCpy4n8zaY5dWQkvH3HW_RRrDqpcn06Yd42HRGOhvC0LlYZTH7W3xUYTjm9Ffw3awsYbFPRbm_hEGYeRKYZMKh08jG5fBFXMpU/s4032/8me%20anniversary.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZ-YP1D_XZL0a3xL-S-4Dc7XNPa-j-excxG0VxiOnZmc3mf1ABIGU0dGUP0Jd0B1THys4ekhUmsgPS6SgzXQCpy4n8zaY5dWQkvH3HW_RRrDqpcn06Yd42HRGOhvC0LlYZTH7W3xUYTjm9Ffw3awsYbFPRbm_hEGYeRKYZMKh08jG5fBFXMpU/w400-h180/8me%20anniversary.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiW_fD0tB1b8VhtnKAur_kjVFvTRfBFJYfkeH4EWMg7yJ7vjj8rDnP_wMM0P-mnj2pyvGBuJqejfZio-U9OqPAsu6SWcnCF76DP7Fk5GET8HA8TAffn5ZU0VWE0eQZaWHJlYprAyNxY2MUIYdKjrsciOsgQZZSPIcH0unTRUk2xzbXwOLr-K58/s4032/9e%20anniversary.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiW_fD0tB1b8VhtnKAur_kjVFvTRfBFJYfkeH4EWMg7yJ7vjj8rDnP_wMM0P-mnj2pyvGBuJqejfZio-U9OqPAsu6SWcnCF76DP7Fk5GET8HA8TAffn5ZU0VWE0eQZaWHJlYprAyNxY2MUIYdKjrsciOsgQZZSPIcH0unTRUk2xzbXwOLr-K58/w400-h180/9e%20anniversary.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>More photos from our anniversary dinner last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>I had hoped to eat lobster again but it wasn't on the menu so  I went for rather boring steak.

And that is what we did except that my husband did not eat. He had a stomach ache and was a bit ill for a few days poor chap.

Later  I hurried to pair the new remote I had ordered via Amazon for my "fire stick" (a device that can be connected to any non smart TV for streaming Netflix, etc). Stupid me, I had brought the fire stick but not the remote. It took a while to "pair" it to the hotel TV but I wouldn't give up. Perhaps the hardest part was opening the back of it to put in the batteries and that's where Eladio's help came in handy. He is much better with his hands than me but I am better than him at "technology". <br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEhD1FeL9tYP92mU_28MEEOCChfctekFq9kARuC-qqc29fPmTz3puqxB-R_Th4OHVynjwyJYkqdfLZOpd1aLTphpCEGfqp-UNPeHbJGkIptxXMvnYEt2HYOxzGCyqWd_s2KBdQc2Ss3gKLgeY9DffNyy2LENR5U6pUzTplWiMkgtwlUt8MpIY/s1884/3%20technology.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="385" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEhD1FeL9tYP92mU_28MEEOCChfctekFq9kARuC-qqc29fPmTz3puqxB-R_Th4OHVynjwyJYkqdfLZOpd1aLTphpCEGfqp-UNPeHbJGkIptxXMvnYEt2HYOxzGCyqWd_s2KBdQc2Ss3gKLgeY9DffNyy2LENR5U6pUzTplWiMkgtwlUt8MpIY/w400-h385/3%20technology.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Some of my "technology"</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Oh technology! What would we do without it? Once I had managed setting it up I was delighted to see it working on the hotel TV. I then looked at "my desk" there and realised just how many technological (and not technological) devices I take with me everywhere. My "essentials"  are my HP laptop, iPad pro (the large screen one - old from 2016 but wonderful), non blue tooth headphones which I prefer as there is no need to charge them, kindle e-book and of course my mobile phone. It's a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE and  the centre of my technological universe like most people's mobile phones these days. If I am travelling by car I  also usually bring our Nespresso and milk frother as I am up too early to get a good cup of coffee at hotels and I need coffee the moment I wake up. Then there is my travel kettle to have decaf tea in the afternoons (Tetleys or PG Tips) and of course my feather pillow. Added to that there are my pills - sleeping pills, vitamins and always, always, always, some scissors and tweezers. You might see from the photo above that I have also brought along spearmint chewing gum to which I am addicted as well as a file with papers in it and a small notebook. The note book was bought at the lovely Brontë parsonage last May. I  love technology but admit to needing a pen and paper sometimes. The folder contains important papers from my little hospitality business by the way. That's a lot to put in a suitcase isn't it? Just missing is the kitchen sink hahahaha. What are your essentials when traveling I wonder; technological and non technological? PS what is not very technological are the two wires coming down from the TV but there you go; not all things are wireless these days. <br></br><p>Eladio, feeling pretty unwell, slept most of the afternoon and I pottered around, enjoying peace on the terrace. He didn't join me for dinner either which was bread and butter ·"stolen" from the breakfast buffet which I had with some ham I had brought and a glass of wine. We then watched something on TV but soon fell asleep. </p><p>Neither of us had a good night but at least Eladio woke up feeling slightly better. He managed a banana and a yoghurt for breakfast while I wolfed down two slices of toast and a croissant (oh I love croissants). </p><p>Tuesday was the day we finally got to see the most important tourist attraction in the area: "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castro_of_Santa_Trega">Castro of Santa Tegra"</a> just a few miles from our hotel.  For the record "<i><span style="background-color: white; color: #202122; font-size: 14px;">A </span><b style="background-color: white; color: #202122; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">castro</b><span style="background-color: white; color: #202122; font-size: 14px;"> is a fortified settlement, usually </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome" style="background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); color: #0645ad; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-decoration-line: none;">pre-Roman</a><span style="background-color: white; color: #202122; font-size: 14px;">, some from late </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age" style="background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); color: #0645ad; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-decoration-line: none;">Bronze Age</a><span style="background-color: white; color: #202122; font-size: 14px;"> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age" style="background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); color: #0645ad; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-decoration-line: none;">Iron Age</a><span style="background-color: white; color: #202122; font-size: 14px;">, the oldest research associated with the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts" style="background: none rgb(255, 255, 255); color: #0645ad; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; text-decoration-line: none;">Celtic</a><span style="background-color: white; color: #202122; font-size: 14px;"> culture.

It is dedicated to the patron saint of Galicia, Santa Tegra, in the local lingo and Santa Tecla in Spanish and is a very important place for "Gallegos".  I had no idea it was so spectacular, dismissing A Guarda as a rather uninteresting town. Well, I was wowed by the settlement on Mount Santa Tegra which is mostly ruins although there are interesting reconstructions of what the "houses " looked like when the Celts lived there before the Romans came. It is situated on a hill over 340m above sea level and commands amazing views of the bay of A Guarda and  of the  mouth of the River Miño.  If you ever pass through this area, I highly recommend a quick visit. A friend, Ana V who is from Galicia, was the person who recommended it to me. Thank you Ana. It was well worth the visit.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEifvngZbPYTqUklZXDCU3JoWjlwZypppBvDjTF6CNMLCT7uGTDqH0UvUoo73mgZF8jQZGczkOjbWRrXpu-TozSiNvwXcWCLHoOoeHmrZA6bONbCW1UT71VCc639l4Hhz33m-_PkFkR4xYcMcl3Ug8-1IMqgeHKlFvZBTxBIpwjmyzV_zZrQ3Vo/s4032/1view%20of%20the%20mouth%20of%20the%20river%20mi%C3%B1o%20and%20Portugal.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEifvngZbPYTqUklZXDCU3JoWjlwZypppBvDjTF6CNMLCT7uGTDqH0UvUoo73mgZF8jQZGczkOjbWRrXpu-TozSiNvwXcWCLHoOoeHmrZA6bONbCW1UT71VCc639l4Hhz33m-_PkFkR4xYcMcl3Ug8-1IMqgeHKlFvZBTxBIpwjmyzV_zZrQ3Vo/w400-h180/1view%20of%20the%20mouth%20of%20the%20river%20mi%C3%B1o%20and%20Portugal.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Views of the Mouth of the River Miño and Portugal from the top of Mount Santa Tegra</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXcG6DR3dnH74jpH4idfPAth3aeTOtpw1wr4c4A9ONUy5XAbARh7jH4mjMBb_-bd0t7NIk7Yf9bwY7_RyWl7XJWZCLZSJvAbSjUSOaCmQlyt7m_DsRMOylmFv9JnL_kWcTRzNQ1sB3HJ43gUPL29B1jKeSFZfgeK89PdIhx8-aASgOCNGQX1g/s6752/2View%20A%20Guarda%20E%20on%20the%20left.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="164" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXcG6DR3dnH74jpH4idfPAth3aeTOtpw1wr4c4A9ONUy5XAbARh7jH4mjMBb_-bd0t7NIk7Yf9bwY7_RyWl7XJWZCLZSJvAbSjUSOaCmQlyt7m_DsRMOylmFv9JnL_kWcTRzNQ1sB3HJ43gUPL29B1jKeSFZfgeK89PdIhx8-aASgOCNGQX1g/w400-h164/2View%20A%20Guarda%20E%20on%20the%20left.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>View of the town of A Guarda from the top of Mount Tegra</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXugbPoQuSe5QRBKl4gzsM-4hNJFoj7afpBlHz42s6PNNlxD-gJwCsaVH4pK1fTtSRZ1JIkNL4gxLLTYKbfdngx7EQalXjN0Dtbrl7GztP3RXhMiUn9guZZKJkLNr51a0GbgiFOXa2aUCiOJMQseqtJnNQuVCj7D_lVl5gxQEi4t12CN3SDlU/s4032/3E%20and%20!%20Castro%20de%20Santa%20Tegra.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiXugbPoQuSe5QRBKl4gzsM-4hNJFoj7afpBlHz42s6PNNlxD-gJwCsaVH4pK1fTtSRZ1JIkNL4gxLLTYKbfdngx7EQalXjN0Dtbrl7GztP3RXhMiUn9guZZKJkLNr51a0GbgiFOXa2aUCiOJMQseqtJnNQuVCj7D_lVl5gxQEi4t12CN3SDlU/w400-h180/3E%20and%20!%20Castro%20de%20Santa%20Tegra.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio and I on Mount Santa Tegra</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEggc_OhizcJEUVJl2UHV29QsjIVaRjzPkgTqB1Szyl7YR7RvDv5jBoAXRG-52AmSsWnG994QRZx85KRbwLzUsVqpeLfOei4Wdn7QycJ1eZ1Mmy8Z7us7iMwg65Zp_Dx4tITxZ-ulS5yjpD5dY2CY7k2qnlPC-jdg7BYSouhwqTGi_KTvQEw4_s/s4032/5E%20ruins%20celtic%20buildings.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEggc_OhizcJEUVJl2UHV29QsjIVaRjzPkgTqB1Szyl7YR7RvDv5jBoAXRG-52AmSsWnG994QRZx85KRbwLzUsVqpeLfOei4Wdn7QycJ1eZ1Mmy8Z7us7iMwg65Zp_Dx4tITxZ-ulS5yjpD5dY2CY7k2qnlPC-jdg7BYSouhwqTGi_KTvQEw4_s/w400-h180/5E%20ruins%20celtic%20buildings.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio showing me the ruins of Celtic buildings on Mount Santa Tegra</i></td></tr></tbody></table> <br></br>It was a beautiful day and I suggested we traveled further afield to the beautiful seaside town of Baiona but my husband's stomach wasn't up to it.

Spanish desserts are usually these: rice pudding (cold), creme caramel and similar puddings all made with milk and then cheese cake. Well I hate puddings made with milk and I hate cheese. I only really like ice cream so I got one at a bar when we left the restaurant.<div><br></br></div><div>It was past 9.30 when we left Los Remos and we were rewarded with a most beautiful sunset above the head of a statue of a fisher woman by the port.

We had had a very relaxing time there. It lived up to its expectations mainly because of its location by the beach on the mouth of the River Miño with its stunning scenery. <div><br></br></div><div>But we had Oporto to look forward to. I had only been once and it was in the summer of 1979 when I was given a free place at a summer course in Portuguese at the prestigious Coimbra University as part of my degree. I was really lucky to be sent there and enjoyed my 3 weeks immersed in the language and culture of the country which grew on me. I went one day to Oporto with a fellow student, a boy from The Azores (funny) who I think was a bit in love with me. I certainly wasn't. All I remember was visiting the port bodegas and getting rather drunk. We then got on a bus that would take us round the city, or round and round it and would serve to see the sights which was the cheapest and easiest way to see Oporto,  none of which I remembered. By then we had missed the bus or train back to Coimbra and had to hitch hike. I shall never forget being picked up by an open ended truck which seemed to go at a snail's pace. I think we arrived at our lodgings at about 5 in the morning. I had been told that Oporto (Porto in Portuguese) was now so full of tourists it has lost its charm. I hoped not but we would see. For Eladio it was his first time so he had no preconceptions.  We stayed at an Airbn house just outside the city and by the sea.</div><div><br></br></div><div>We set off at a leisurely pace on <b>Wednesday</b> morning as we couldn't check in until 3 pm and our journey  to Oporto was under 1.5h. Before heading for Portugal we drove into A Guarda to get provisions from a local supermarket and some cash from the "hole in the wall". I could have kicked myself later when I saw loads of supermarkets near our Airbnb in Oporto including the ubiquitous Mercadona and even Super Cor (both Spanish ) not to mention Lidl and plenty of Portuguese supermarkets. I kicked myself too when the hotel rang me to say I had left my precious kindle behind. What would I do without it? Thankfully we were quite near and rushed back to get it. I was thankful for the honesty of the chambermaids; I really was.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Thus we set off later  from A Guarda to the nearest border of Portugal - Vila Nova de Cerveira, it's only 15km so we were soon in Portuguese territory. <br></br><div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHGgPldE4YW31m2zAy5xq_oBwf5xExRoBw6cx52aA98ALYWvK_-1pZEnRcFAWyazh_7VpfvlC_2N6kgXqwzIs4XxeIryCEyoJ6M12U4Av19nBsfvAPxJJ8p1akjuIaXw3Kdj4HPj8RiPeFcWUlopY4rz06tZ4lMzCw-uPoiIPsp6vjUT8om8g/s3181/1Entering%20Portugal%20Viana%20de%20Cerveira.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHGgPldE4YW31m2zAy5xq_oBwf5xExRoBw6cx52aA98ALYWvK_-1pZEnRcFAWyazh_7VpfvlC_2N6kgXqwzIs4XxeIryCEyoJ6M12U4Av19nBsfvAPxJJ8p1akjuIaXw3Kdj4HPj8RiPeFcWUlopY4rz06tZ4lMzCw-uPoiIPsp6vjUT8om8g/w229-h400/1Entering%20Portugal%20Viana%20de%20Cerveira.jpg" width="229"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Entering Portugal from Spain at the frontier of Vila Nova de Cerveira</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br>From Vila Nova de Cerveira to our destination, Foz de Douro, just 5km from the centre of Oporto, it was just over an hour's drive - 105km. We had to manage the toll on the A28 but did it. I still don't really understand how payment for the toll roads works in Portugal!</div><div><br></br></div><div>Soon we arrived in the Foz de Douro district - perhaps the most chic and expensive because it's by the city beaches and lovely parks. It is where the River Douro meets the Atlantic Ocean. So we had come from one river mouth to another. Foz is the Portuguese for river mouth. The source of the River Douro (in Spanish Duero), like the Miño, is in Spain; the head water being in the province of Soria. It's one of both Spain and Portugal's most important rivers.</div><div><br></br></div><div>We were there early and thankfully the host, Joana, had no problem with us checking in at 1 instead of 3 pm. In all our time in Oporto we kept forgetting that it is one hour earlier than in Spain. I loved our little <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/47828610?adults=1&amp;guests=1&amp;s=13&amp;unique_share_id=d4688967-27a1-43dc-bf51-fce0f870c67b&amp;_branch_match_id=1083649188351424583&amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXT0zKS9LLTdUPM8kvLArzyPQpTgIAM8jnzxsAAAA%3D&amp;source_impression_id=p3_1661370939_nXv9KTR3K1vNwPCD">Airbnb house</a> on a tiny street off the Passeio Alegre (translates badly as happy walkway!).

The bathroom is on the ground floor and the bedrooms are upstairs. The worst thing is that the staircase is spiral and very steep. I hate spiral staircases as they make me feel dizzy. Thus I could not sleep upstairs or enjoy the beautiful terrace on the top floor and had to sleep on the sofa bed in the lounge. I honestly don't know how Eladio got his suitcase upstairs. We could have slept together on the sofa bed but a sofa bed is never as comfortable as a real bed. Thus on our wedding anniversary trip in Oporto we had to sleep separately. The Airbnb house has great reviews but there is not a mention or photo of the staircase and there should be. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi_rnzSiyvhMYE2pENFGstR7T4XaFhYJjlAlz-tUFs29-wfN0A81njWcW1X9rvfr_nEX_j2QIYXehRHJcI7Xg2YV9CzjmcZHvge8lrRJp3mBhF1dejCqQ2nc0SBdvEdHi3tiiEK-EBLAxYweVuq-IUyMg_dgH6CoO5088ese_hJtnPks26GOQQ/s4032/20220826_074445.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi_rnzSiyvhMYE2pENFGstR7T4XaFhYJjlAlz-tUFs29-wfN0A81njWcW1X9rvfr_nEX_j2QIYXehRHJcI7Xg2YV9CzjmcZHvge8lrRJp3mBhF1dejCqQ2nc0SBdvEdHi3tiiEK-EBLAxYweVuq-IUyMg_dgH6CoO5088ese_hJtnPks26GOQQ/w180-h400/20220826_074445.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The impossible spiral staircase at our Airbnb house in Oporto</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br></br></div><div>Had I known it I would have chosen somewhere else. Also the inviting terrace which is the main photo of the listing is actually upstairs which meant I could not enjoy it. On the plus side it's in a quiet street, is clean and well equipped. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Once we had settled in and had a very late lunch, we went out exploring. It was a grey and cloudy day; the coldest of our holiday and I was grateful I had brought leggings and a coat. We intended just to walk in our neighbourhood - Foz de Douro, near the city beaches but when we spied one of the old trams we decided to get on it. Did you know the trams in Portugal are the oldest in Europe? They date back to 1895.  I had seen them in Lisbon and even been on one in Oporto in 1979 so was pleased to see them still working. Today they exist mostly for tourists and to preserve their heritage with just 3 lines running now.  Everything was grey and misty so we hardly appreciated the ride along the River Douro into the heart of the city but enjoyed the tram ride. </div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEga4g521Y5F7ENpPxqvv-iEJAvD-c2crOqy9z8er0wEt_GlieaWlLYMoKd39INcVja1_fgga46Prth7aZKGmfWn49zRFVbCzHzil1HzU83nGOvdcRswluFcoNtQ_utgM8C5GGztLoXPTSCNQ-MiNhI1PM_qTHoCSvrFSRLGs5XUxKBQoxUcgaM/s4032/3Tram%20on%20Passeio%20Alegre.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEga4g521Y5F7ENpPxqvv-iEJAvD-c2crOqy9z8er0wEt_GlieaWlLYMoKd39INcVja1_fgga46Prth7aZKGmfWn49zRFVbCzHzil1HzU83nGOvdcRswluFcoNtQ_utgM8C5GGztLoXPTSCNQ-MiNhI1PM_qTHoCSvrFSRLGs5XUxKBQoxUcgaM/w400-h180/3Tram%20on%20Passeio%20Alegre.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;">For 3.50 euros each we took the tram near our house which deposited us by the University and next to a charming old Church called "Carmo".

The book shop is over 100 years old and is known for its stunning Art Deco, Art Nouveau and Gothic Interior. It became even more famous worldwide supposedly because the Harry Potter library scenes were inspired by it, although that is disputed by JK Rowling.  But there is a connection to the popular writer with Portugal because she lived in Oporto for a few years in the 90s where she married a Portuguese student with whom she had a child. To make ends meet, like I did in Madrid years ago, she taught English as a second language here. Later in the week, our Beetle Tour guide showed us the café  (The Majestic) where he says she wrote her first Harry Potter manuscript. I investigated further. In her biography by Sean Smith, he mentions she jotted down lines of a future manuscript there. It's a very expensive cafe so I wonder if it was in her budget. In any case, during her time here, she must have visited the wonderful bookshop. And I bet she loved the staircase just as much. </div><div><br></br></div><div>The staircase is the central piece and I had to get a photo from Internet to show you what it really looks like as it was impossible to take a good photo of it inside the store.

We got The Wizard of Oz in English for Elliot, the only other option for children's literature in English was Harry Potter and for Juliet we got a book of fairy tales in Spanish. I hope they treasure these books as we treasured this visit. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Oporto was teeming with people and I think we had had enough of the crowds so made our way back to the tram stop. Everyone around us here seems to speak Spanish and all the employees we meet on transport, restaurants and bars, all speak not just Spanish, but very good English  and quite good French as well as their native Portuguese. The Portuguese, unlike the Spaniards, are good linguists. It annoys me when I try and speak Portuguese to be replied to in Spanish. Things have changed here I can see. When I first came in the 70's no one wanted to speak Spanish preferring English or French always.  The Portuguese were always reluctant to speak Spanish even though it is easy for them. One of the reasons they are reluctant is because of the age old uneasiness between the two countries - Portugal got its independence on and off and was only a truly independent nation after the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494. Still today there is a famous saying in Portuguese that goes: "De Espanha, nem bom vento nem bom casamento" which translates roughly into "From Spain, neither good winds nor marriage will come". Today that uneasiness seems to be disappearing yet still the government won't agree to a high speed train from Madrid to Lisbon. Yet in the street there is friendliness between both peoples. We saw so many Spanish tourists we reckoned that more than 50% of those visiting Oporto are from Spain. </div><div><br></br></div><div>As to the difference between the two languages; yes they are close but not enough to understand each other perfectly. For me and I have studied both languages, Portuguese is a bit like medieval Spanish and quite easy to read if you know Spanish. The pronunciation though is very, very different. Some people say it sounds like Russian. They are right as the "s" , depending where it goes in a word, can be  pronounced "sh" and the "z" is pronounced "zh". </div><div><br></br></div><div>One of the reasons the Portuguese speak such good English is owed to history.  My father always told me that England is Portugal's oldest ally and it's true. So it is not unusual to still see English style pillar boxes and phone booths and even double decker buses. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5ezxCeiuh80xWTZ8mCQ7ho5Q73yzPWuKSEdBbg5Pu6xUjWqObMtpAcKz83j8T0S1_8RZ5fBgYbPGT4iYy6FUyDr4G0-t0MwaeXfbWo-E71U63Nk88ugzk9tm6kEyvcYp2cAugU4_3bshcP2SOTv68uw6-WYjpfAHxsVX-4rvrpFQoM_wqQvs/s4032/20220826_090554.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5ezxCeiuh80xWTZ8mCQ7ho5Q73yzPWuKSEdBbg5Pu6xUjWqObMtpAcKz83j8T0S1_8RZ5fBgYbPGT4iYy6FUyDr4G0-t0MwaeXfbWo-E71U63Nk88ugzk9tm6kEyvcYp2cAugU4_3bshcP2SOTv68uw6-WYjpfAHxsVX-4rvrpFQoM_wqQvs/w180-h400/20220826_090554.jpg" width="180"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>English style pillar box in Oporto that you see everywhere</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>Even the tram driver on our journey home was trilingual!

We had no plans that day except to see more of Oporto. This time we took the bus into the city - much faster and cheaper. The 500 dropped us off near the cathedral. But before we went in we enjoyed the views, such as this one below with Eladio. I think Oporto could be called the red roofed city. You see beautiful buildings next to shabby ones, old ones next to new ones but somehow everything comes together to create an oldie worldie atmosphere of old and new. Atmosphere, that is what there is about Oporto and Portugal in general. The past is always with you. Here are two photos of typical views of the houses and buildings in Oporto with their red roofs.

He told me they were made to protect buildings and the blue dye was used as it was the cheapest. But   later they were appreciated for their beauty. I agree. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Oporto is divided by the Douro River and I knew there was a bridge somewhere to cross from the heart of the city, "Ribeira" (means riverside) to the the town of Vila Nova de Gaia where all the Port wine bodegas are, the ones where I got drunk in 1979. I  could spy it from the cathedral but it was quite difficult to find but find it we did and were awed too, in the same way we were awed by the Lello bookshop. We couldn't stop taking photos.</div><div><br></br></div><div>This very old bridge is called Luíz 1 and is named after the Portuguese King but without the title "Dom" as revenge by the people of Oporto when he didn't turn up for the inauguration. It was designed by Téophile Seyrigm, a partner of Gustave Eiffel. Another bridge, the Maria Pia railway bridge was designed by Eiffel himself in 1877 and it seems people mix them up  as they are pretty similar in design. "Ponte Luiz 1"was for many years the longest bridge in the world of its type (double deck metal arch bridge) measuring 172 metres. It must have been incredibly modern for its time. Today it is one of Oporto's main landmarks and every tourist who comes here has to cross it like we did this week.

I wouldn't be seen dead on a hop on hop off open topped tourist bus, but was happy to be driven around Oporto by our lovely guide and owner, Pedro in a vintage VW. Those were the days. I remember traveling from England to Spain  in the 70's with a friend, Sophie, who had one.  This was ours by the way. It was such a fun experience. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZOyn6DKZxwpm6IVhDkYkin5vAcr-d-M0ztvaPCdb2Sh0k7KAwyZOZQw-r498tY0o8NXqV6rlX_j5-NzHK2P1FKhsnWextr_Oa9lsr7AtZcBMWEuRM79x0u3sX1Q1qfoSuCnxeAG6Svc2EcSRHICWvlcoT1V0_lqpVmsS1gGhsGZcqrjULiis/s4032/a.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgZOyn6DKZxwpm6IVhDkYkin5vAcr-d-M0ztvaPCdb2Sh0k7KAwyZOZQw-r498tY0o8NXqV6rlX_j5-NzHK2P1FKhsnWextr_Oa9lsr7AtZcBMWEuRM79x0u3sX1Q1qfoSuCnxeAG6Svc2EcSRHICWvlcoT1V0_lqpVmsS1gGhsGZcqrjULiis/w400-h180/a.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Setting off on our Beetle Tour</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Pedro was a great guide and I cannot summrise all he told us about the city and its history as I would need to write a guide book myself to do so. Suffice it to say he knew exactly what to show us and where. I loved his stories too which made the city come to life for us. </div><div><br></br></div><div>But I must tell you 2 of them. The first is the story behind a statue of the Portuguese writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilo_Castelo_Branco">Camilo Castelo Branco</a> and his forbidden lover Ana Plácido in front of the old city prison.  They were both married but fell in love and both were imprisoned for 2 years for their crime. It was in the prison that he wrote his most famous book "Doomed Love" (Amor de Perdiçao). It is a bit like a Portuguese Rome and Juliet and is one of the most famous Portuguese novels. Their own story ended happily when both their spouses died and they were able to marry. This is the beautiful statue of them outside the prison. In the statue, Ana Plácido is naked and her lover tries to cover her with his coat. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcaGahZr9IfWJuss0Pr9QAqeF9bY3OeEiXgdHK9ptmmwT45pRSRUXF9Omlv1Lq9fVdfaMHHbKCpUtWuSzyueST2XORbGikfsvT4k-Fa8JDVodG2el4eKbb66Id_oHhITIP1aBzcWPO_MvKZncsazgI1-liuv5jyfDnBOrBl7ueYwcrl9ySWB8/s1200/DrH3lRGXgAEp0e9.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcaGahZr9IfWJuss0Pr9QAqeF9bY3OeEiXgdHK9ptmmwT45pRSRUXF9Omlv1Lq9fVdfaMHHbKCpUtWuSzyueST2XORbGikfsvT4k-Fa8JDVodG2el4eKbb66Id_oHhITIP1aBzcWPO_MvKZncsazgI1-liuv5jyfDnBOrBl7ueYwcrl9ySWB8/w300-h400/DrH3lRGXgAEp0e9.jpg" width="300"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Statue of Camilo Castro Branco and Ana Placido</i></td></tr></tbody></table>The other story is about King Pedro IV (1798-1834) who gave his heart to the city after his death. It was a gesture to thank the people for their devotion, sacrifice and courage during the siege of the city against his brother Miguel 1. They literally fed the troops and thus became known as "tripeiros" (guts). Thus one of the most famous dishes in Porto is actually tripe which Eladio loves and I hate. He got to try it at dinner later that night.  The King's  heart lies in the church called Nossa Senhora de Lapa.

A holiday to Portugal is never complete without going to a Fado show. Fado (meaning Fate) is to Portugal as is Flamenco to Spain but so different. The music is melancholy, full of what the Portuguese call "saudade"  - a sort of longing and yearning. It can be sung by a man or a woman and is always accompanied by a guitar and in Portugal there are various kinds. If you want to know more, look up the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%A1lia_Rodrigues">Amália Rodrigues</a>. She is still the Queen of Fado and the "fadista" who made Fado famous worldwide. We booked a show in the city at a Fado house called <a href="https://fadonabaixa.com/">Fado na baixa</a> and were not disappointed. We especially loved the singing of Gonçalo Mendes who studied at Coimbra University - where I spent 3 weeks in 1979 learning Portuguese- a lot of Fado is from this prestigious University town. He wore the black cape the students wear there when it is cold. </div><div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br></br></div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhF6eDTr2OlxdMIkzV2YJ-AohDeXGEc_Fd2RNnCWUWndf5lktP00MftYa5Z13XgAKtRoltPdjb4skFdDeq7DF5WoAX-_wnvWMm-RU-ZdIOEcF1avhl2mh3VZmdVdxvigsPoOi7lH4l3MK6CYwDIGg_JVl4O2NU7IdEt7JHeZn6D9FvJ7bYy3f8/s4032/1fad0.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhF6eDTr2OlxdMIkzV2YJ-AohDeXGEc_Fd2RNnCWUWndf5lktP00MftYa5Z13XgAKtRoltPdjb4skFdDeq7DF5WoAX-_wnvWMm-RU-ZdIOEcF1avhl2mh3VZmdVdxvigsPoOi7lH4l3MK6CYwDIGg_JVl4O2NU7IdEt7JHeZn6D9FvJ7bYy3f8/w400-h180/1fad0.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Gonçalo Mendes singing at the Fado show on Friday night</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;">Satisfied with our experience, we walked out into the cobbled street of <span style="background-color: white; color: #5f6368; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;">Rua São João</span>  which we realised would take us down to the river in Ribeira, a place we hadn't been to till then. The area is called "Cais da Ribeira" which translates into the Ribeira pier or pier side but I think the correct translation is river side  Wow what a place; teeming with people from all over the world and all their languages. I admire the Portuguese who cater to the tourists here flawlessly in many languages.   What a place, what views of the Luiz 1 bridge, the other side; Vila Nova de Gaia, all the boats, small traders, people reading tarot cards - would have loved to have mine read but Eladio would not have been happy hahahaha. Despite the throngs of people, it is a vibrant and romantic place, the perfect spot for our dinner that night. But before we searched for a restaurant we had to take more photos.

Avó with an acute accent on the o means grandmother in Portuguese. Very confusingly grandfather is "Avô" with a circumflex on the o.  I always found that difficult as the pronunciation is quite similar. Avó Maria did not have good reviews but we liked it and Eladio said his tripe was out of this world. Good for him. I hate tripe and once again ate "bacalhau" haha. Apart from being multilingual, waiters in Portugal and elsewhere need to have another skill and that is taking photos of their customers with their mobiles.

We took the 500 bus again which dropped us off, as always at the Praça do Infante Dom Henrique. The statue of Prince Henry the Navigator (1394-1460) points to the sea in a symbolic way. After all Portugal is a nation of famous navigators and explorers who changed the world in so many ways. </div></div><div><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEizY_ggBAtbZcg9U_C7kcRrey45KF-lVmt3W3ZCAHZDGj-b_l_JwaPNfSF6nGJL8zgOdJywDmPInn4cJLu_Iy0cIIP1kYNgSUMdw1ObW3c006JkRBf1TUnJXMZ9v8UruSufRznWEqUpw15i0BbUXkn6__yiMh1XhmZcfn4MhAYMdia7D4NBNnI/s4032/1%20Infante%20Enrique%20Square.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEizY_ggBAtbZcg9U_C7kcRrey45KF-lVmt3W3ZCAHZDGj-b_l_JwaPNfSF6nGJL8zgOdJywDmPInn4cJLu_Iy0cIIP1kYNgSUMdw1ObW3c006JkRBf1TUnJXMZ9v8UruSufRznWEqUpw15i0BbUXkn6__yiMh1XhmZcfn4MhAYMdia7D4NBNnI/w400-h180/1%20Infante%20Enrique%20Square.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Prince Henry Square where we always got off and on the bus during our stay</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div>From there we walked along the Cais da Ribeira to Vila Nova de Gaia and then to the port wine cellar of my choice. Most of them are English and I don't know why but I went for <a href="https://www.taylor.pt/">Taylor's</a>. I could not have made a better choice as, after all, they are purveyors of port wine to none other than HM the Queen. The port wine makers date back to 1692 and is still a family concern.

Maybe you know or maybe you don't that the <a href="https://portugalonline.com/portugal-blogs/barcelos-rooster">cockerel is the symbol of Portugal</a>.

We sat in the shade in such beautiful surroundings that the port could only taste magnificent too. We were given white port called Chip Dry- as an aperitif - and an LBV (Late bottled vintage). I liked them both and was interested to know the difference between the two most famous fortified wines, Sherry and Port, both from the Iberian Peninsula and both made famous by my countrymen. The first difference is the region - Porto and Jerez, then the grape type. Sherry is mostly made from white grapes and port from red. The real difference though is when the  fortification - when a spirit (mostly brandy)  is introduced- takes place. With sherry it happens at the end of fermentation and with port wine before fermentation has finished. </div><div><br></br><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhAcLvIPLjGembxCZq0ArAhcC8_3HqMSkoH6l4_vi6q2l_BhkV_BasHzAP4n9OEnGt_LSXfraM0Sb1QmCqXR2NJKZOZF5yOf9M0fsJYaDyMujkg86LHWKlKp7wsIrMoDmdQ7XI_foirzmgBPD42uslyIyjWRueUsj_ruptI-0oTwWtSnzzlQ8A/s4032/5%20E%20port%20wine%20tasting.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhAcLvIPLjGembxCZq0ArAhcC8_3HqMSkoH6l4_vi6q2l_BhkV_BasHzAP4n9OEnGt_LSXfraM0Sb1QmCqXR2NJKZOZF5yOf9M0fsJYaDyMujkg86LHWKlKp7wsIrMoDmdQ7XI_foirzmgBPD42uslyIyjWRueUsj_ruptI-0oTwWtSnzzlQ8A/w400-h180/5%20E%20port%20wine%20tasting.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio enjoying the port wine tasting session</i></td></tr></tbody></table>While we were there we had to buy some port from Taylor's of course. Eladio was keen to buy a bottle for each of his siblings and one for us which came to a pretty penny but we were feeling generous. The only problem then was carrying it. The option was by taxi. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Our next date was the boat tour but that wasn't until 2.30 so we decided to have lunch at the restaurant at Taylor's which I had spied when I went to the loo. I came across a jewel of a restaurant called <a href="https://www.baraofladgate.com/en/">Barâo (Baron) Fladgate </a>- one of the partners of Taylor's. What a place, another magnificent setting over the River Douro.

And this was our yacht with our fellow passengers, a family from near Ascot in the UK and a couple from Boston, US. The yacht is called "Once upon a time ..." and is captained by a young man, Augusto and his partner, Miguel. The yacht belongs to Augusto's father and he started his Airbnb boat trips just 2 months ago with great success.
