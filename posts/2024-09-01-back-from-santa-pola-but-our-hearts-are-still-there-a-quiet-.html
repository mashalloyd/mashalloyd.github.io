Thankfully I have Tana to meet all their needs. But I am the main organiser and it's hard work. I have to be terribly careful with double booking which can happen. </div><div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Tuesday</b> was Suzy's big day. She was to have her first appointment with the outpatient psychiatrist in Santa Pola - the only public health one in the area - and the day could not have turned out worse. First she couldn't find a working hole in the wall to get cash for the bus and blamed it on a conspiracy from the state. She went to the wrong centre through no fault of her own and had to walk miles to the correct one. She was 18 minutes later  and the doctor had gone out to have breakfast! When she returned Suzy was so cross she put in a complaint and refused to see the woman.  The incident was like a huge step backwards in her progress and had us worried stiff all week. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Olivia and family cheered us up though when they came for a swim and an early dinner. They took our minds off the main issue in our lives; the cross we have to bear. Tana made our dinner which we had on the table on the kitchen patio and it was great to be with Elliot and Juliet that day. Elliot was looking smashing as that day he had had a haircut. That shouldn't be news except it is as from the moment go, he has always had a tantrum when his father tried to cut his hair until last Monday when he agreed to go to a barber. It has taken 5 years for him to accept having his hair cut without kicking up a huge fuss. Here are some photos to remember the moment. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2l2lwMZ8DyYSP1sqmU4UEdbldo_IKuZSd9HMRKO9vB59_CuSdbWdt4Dus_pUv8a_aLBo_X5kqm6yvmT67lhyphenhyphenL4_nHq-NFvS5tRw460SnIF1RC3UKvAeQpmpf5t509rEZgtCGwbuu9uP_sETO52bl4vtr_D3mZvnSbKM-YL6QuWfe81gjqH_XHYw/s2000/IMG-20240827-WA0006.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2l2lwMZ8DyYSP1sqmU4UEdbldo_IKuZSd9HMRKO9vB59_CuSdbWdt4Dus_pUv8a_aLBo_X5kqm6yvmT67lhyphenhyphenL4_nHq-NFvS5tRw460SnIF1RC3UKvAeQpmpf5t509rEZgtCGwbuu9uP_sETO52bl4vtr_D3mZvnSbKM-YL6QuWfe81gjqH_XHYw/s320/IMG-20240827-WA0006.jpg" width="180"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKGRwuiQw1wZXOsHauhay6Zos-SN0tysZ0r76Z-0eChhSUrTm4lfswh4SQ7vr1iM1Rm1-27DD6Q_MLtgOMY_N5R5r9aQjYjZRM4FQ61gF0r3IVIaIpgLFSR7BYBGBvE3J9kvr0V0yBFEZqWWG8EKP_CSMkqWwQzgXagdPrWTa6nkKC5FhwKv3RbQ/s1920/IMG-20240827-WA0007.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKGRwuiQw1wZXOsHauhay6Zos-SN0tysZ0r76Z-0eChhSUrTm4lfswh4SQ7vr1iM1Rm1-27DD6Q_MLtgOMY_N5R5r9aQjYjZRM4FQ61gF0r3IVIaIpgLFSR7BYBGBvE3J9kvr0V0yBFEZqWWG8EKP_CSMkqWwQzgXagdPrWTa6nkKC5FhwKv3RbQ/s320/IMG-20240827-WA0007.jpg" width="180"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>For the first time since he was born, Elliot finally accepting having a hair cut without a fuss</i></td></tr></tbody></table>That night my dear boys, Mohammad and Sarang, from Iraq and India returned.

We had left her and Santa Pola but our hearts are still there.  </div><div><br></br></div><div>We had a smooth drive and arrived on time for a late lunch.

That's a first this summer. We came home to have wine and pistachios at our house which later became a dinner of sorts. We opened the bottle of red wine we had bought in Orvieto (Umbria) and I drank far too much of it. Our "sobremesa" - a Spanish term for sitting round a table after a meal and talking, went on till late. But that night I slept like a log. Being in Montrondo had done me the world of good.</div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Saturday</b> was cloudy and cool with the highest temperature only reaching 20'ºc. I made a typical dish from Madrid called "cocido madrileño" for lunch to share with José Antonio and Dolores' family. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We went on another walk in the afternoon which turned out to be a bit of an adventure as we got lost trying to get back to the village without wading across the river. Eladio thought it was great fun but I must say I got rather tired. I hoped our next walk would be easier and less of an obstacle race. Here is a photo of Eladio when we finally crossed the river without having to take our shoes off in the freezing water.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9r90EvFNJNIPNgcYN7oXmYTeORseQi-v0eWAZO6rsaeIceOVaYA4SXX8TWLq_2vVSjLgVS63701U-hNN2fdBoTFPbJ2tG8_yYh_EDYkZ5tXKataXsLFQhTkkeYedCXMgROL2XLZRxPmSa5gkD3HFSMAkv_dEp2phBOGpolwhHkzIaSbFR8XsNKw/s4032/20240831_185524.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9r90EvFNJNIPNgcYN7oXmYTeORseQi-v0eWAZO6rsaeIceOVaYA4SXX8TWLq_2vVSjLgVS63701U-hNN2fdBoTFPbJ2tG8_yYh_EDYkZ5tXKataXsLFQhTkkeYedCXMgROL2XLZRxPmSa5gkD3HFSMAkv_dEp2phBOGpolwhHkzIaSbFR8XsNKw/w400-h180/20240831_185524.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br></br></td></tr></tbody></table><div>Yesterday "La Vuelta" - the Tour of Spain cycling race, had its finish line in Villablino, so close to us. Had it been 30 odd years ago, we would have been there for sure; especially my nephew Miguel. We didn't go but, we met up with friends for dinner that night in Robles at a place called La Bolera. It was odd to be going out to dinner so late at night (21.30) in Montrondo but the occasion was well worth it. We were looking forward to seeing Ludy who is married to the famous ex cyclist Pedro Delgado, and her family as well as a cycling journalist and mutual friend, Sergi. It was to be a great night out and such a change in my  routine. Eladio chickened out so I went with Miguel my nephew. We had a great dinner and were not home until nearly 2 in the morning!!!</div><div><br></br></div><div>I woke up today at 9 am; very late for me. Today looks like it will be a sunny day and no doubt we shall go for another walk with Toño and Dolores later in the day. I look forward to that so long as it is on a natural path and not through fields cut off by barbed wire or across the river hahahahaha.</div><div><br></br></div><div>That's it from me today. Cheers till next Sunday,</div><div><br></br></div><div>Masha</div><div><div><br></br></div><div><div><br></br><div><br></br></div></div></div></div>
