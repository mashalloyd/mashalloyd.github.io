At around 3 pm, Suzy, our adored oldest daughter, was admitted into a psychiatric ward in Alicante and was very soon diagnosed with Persistent Delusional Disorder. <div><br></br></div><div>I debated whether to tell this story or not. Without telling it I could not continue with my blog as anything else in our lives pales in comparison. It's Suzy who gave me permission so I am writing this with her blessing and also because mental health should not be taboo or  anything to be ashamed of. It can be far worse than a physical medical issue. I hope you agree.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Someone said to me recently "you are only as happy as your least happiest child". She was right. So I suffered while I knew she suffered because people with delusional disorder have unshakable beliefs. Thus they believe that they are being persecuted or whatever the belief is and they suffer as one would in normal life. I suffered for her but also for us because she didn't want any contact with us. It was difficult to even find out where she had been admitted and as soon as we could, we made our way to Santa Pola to our apartment which felt so strange and empty without Suzy. <div><br></br></div><div>I couldn't sleep, I could hardly eat and smoked myself silly. We were not on holiday, I can tell you and did not go on walks or out for meals. How could we? How could I enjoy life while my daughter was alone in a psychiatric ward? The only thing that calmed me down was continuously playing stupid patience (the card game) on my phone. I have to say this has been the most difficult period of my life. Thank God I had my husband.</div><div><br></br></div><div> After far too long a time, we were finally contacted by her psychiatrist who wouldn't tell us much and only wanted us to sort out Suzy's health paperwork as she was registered in Madrid and had to be registered here. That kept us busy and gave us an excuse to go to the hospital where, finally, Suzy agreed to see her father, but not me. I can't tell you how much that hurt but I knew it was the illness talking. Eventually and after much insistence from her father, a few days later, she let me see her and she melted into my arms, all of her qualms about seeing me gone. That's the photo I have chosen for this week's feature photo. She was happy to see us and seemed like the old Suzy. I was so glad to hear too that she was actually happy in the ward and liked being there and was grateful for the help she was being given.  She showed us around and frankly the place was very nice. She accepted the medication and therapy both of which had begun to help. She had made friends and joined all the therapy sessions, loved the food and slept well. That was music to my ears. She even accepted her diagnosis and  began to question some of her bizarre beliefs. She is on the road to recovery if, pray to God, she doesn't falter and carries on with the medication and therapy.</div><div><br></br></div><div>And here is a photo of her with her father and dear Pippa on another visit. I love it.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixeGsRuMpsFDF3UbBgGZCHY96guLShSwNpltpWX9qBstNpKRLO3q9gOr1qMKZQKCSzdVr2yW3jsoAdwQXq_u1DSvRx_pIygL2W7gsXpMBEElCpJ8ZQiE7HSeU-OlKC5saBi6CSDdMR0FdPzd54UaO-bLZvZXbFblWtw5XsB00TKgjbSF7wiTpMwQ/s4032/20240815_114223.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixeGsRuMpsFDF3UbBgGZCHY96guLShSwNpltpWX9qBstNpKRLO3q9gOr1qMKZQKCSzdVr2yW3jsoAdwQXq_u1DSvRx_pIygL2W7gsXpMBEElCpJ8ZQiE7HSeU-OlKC5saBi6CSDdMR0FdPzd54UaO-bLZvZXbFblWtw5XsB00TKgjbSF7wiTpMwQ/w180-h400/20240815_114223.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Visiting Suzy and taking Pippa to see her</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Only then could we begin to live.  We managed one trip down to the beach at 7.30 am  one morning to beat the crowds and the heat.

So they came on Thursday and brought much joy and chaos with them. They were a wonderful distraction. It also meant that Oli would get to see Suzy with whom she had also cut off ties  because of her illness. </div><div><br></br></div><div>She had news for me about our upcoming trip to London in September where she will be presenting the awards for the 50 best hotels in the world at the Guildhall. Wow! The news was that we will be accommodated at <a href="https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/london">The Rosewood Hotel</a> in London, a wonderful 5 star place where just one night costs over 800 pounds!! Oli is wondering what the breakfast will be like. I am wondering what the bathroom amenities will be like, not to mention the comfort of the bed. We will be truly pampered there for 4 whole nights! That is really something to look forward to. </div><div><br></br></div><div>They arrived on Thursday midday and we had lunch ready for them to sit down.

She was a bit reluctant, even though Suzy had given her permission. We felt so out of it. We are her parents but because she is not a minor, we get no say in anything at all. It's very frustrating.  She grudgingly agreed to one on Friday morning.  </div><div><br></br></div><div>We spent the afternoon with the kids by the pool  and on our way back bumped into our Polish/Swedish neighbours.  My  friend Magda has a son called Elliot, like our Elliot and we managed to get a photo of them together which was rather fun.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_tsynCFXuY1QFjl8bFY_TWMjxxb5xYNhV-va3zFMGAA1VHvtdFKBumCOBkJNhsPkdJe6DkleJbfsB-pRdqV70NkF3c2HdgNdkDNVT2okyyXiQFT_EyUNC8pmjPTy4PYgT44bwZ9oON5aRtd-M6x2m9WfFa4VykOzT1xtrWpjnbTpfjsYKuZsKAg/s4032/20240815_191437.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_tsynCFXuY1QFjl8bFY_TWMjxxb5xYNhV-va3zFMGAA1VHvtdFKBumCOBkJNhsPkdJe6DkleJbfsB-pRdqV70NkF3c2HdgNdkDNVT2okyyXiQFT_EyUNC8pmjPTy4PYgT44bwZ9oON5aRtd-M6x2m9WfFa4VykOzT1xtrWpjnbTpfjsYKuZsKAg/w180-h400/20240815_191437.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Juliet and Elliot with Elliot and Adrian, our Polish/Swedish neighbours</i>. </td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div><br></br></div><div> Oli and I couldn't be bothered to cook so we went to have a pizza across the road at Soleluna, now under new management. The pizzas were divine and we had an interesting conversation with the waitress, Nadia who is from Belaruns. The children  behaved reasonably well and I actually enjoyed the meal. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Friday came and we rang the hospital for our appointment only to be surprised to hear Suzy was being discharged that very day. I thought it was far too early but what could we do? Nothing. We did get to see the psychiatrist who told us Suzy would be continuing therapy with a local woman psychiatrist and would continue to take her medication. Later we went to pick her up and it was such a joyful moment. We sort of celebrated and went to an ice cream parlour together. The kids then wanted to go to the pool so we all went together. I was so happy to see my two daughters together having a heart to heart and making up for missed time.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Dinner was made by Suzy - I had sprained my wrist (damn it) and it was perfect. We were all together and we had fun. We really did. I felt so much better.</div><div><br></br></div><div>But 7 in the flat is a bit too much and yesterday Oli and co left at around midday, after another heart to heart with Suzy. </div><div><br></br></div><div>They took a while to gather all their stuff and we kept the kids busy as you can see in this lovely photo Suzy took of us. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJDn8sJlIYgEroNNrxUeJIeCKG8-hbTP_xlVMxC1Qen_JSZjbvZNPrOk1Ll3tHEvR2e6XiA5oMHVhRlqsHT1CuBYhwLbJTZ0-Dqs8nPd9-YOjXD1VQRnzIQ-ZREbnHmAnkSo1yzyLHIhxndJ6hUvrgxl4qNF3hkAX7f7N40yNKvKJ0i8WhnHICgg/s1600/IMG-20240818-WA0009.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJDn8sJlIYgEroNNrxUeJIeCKG8-hbTP_xlVMxC1Qen_JSZjbvZNPrOk1Ll3tHEvR2e6XiA5oMHVhRlqsHT1CuBYhwLbJTZ0-Dqs8nPd9-YOjXD1VQRnzIQ-ZREbnHmAnkSo1yzyLHIhxndJ6hUvrgxl4qNF3hkAX7f7N40yNKvKJ0i8WhnHICgg/w301-h400/IMG-20240818-WA0009.jpg" width="301"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A lovely moment with our grandchildren yesterday just before they left</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br></br></div><div>And suddenly we were alone again but with Suzy who seems to be on the right path.

I had to cancel the hotel I had booked  in Galicia. Instead, we shall go out to dinner to my favourite restaurant in the area, the Michelin Star La Finca. That will be something else to look forward to. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Slowly I am regaining my life and adjusting to our circumstances and slowly the family is being reunited.
