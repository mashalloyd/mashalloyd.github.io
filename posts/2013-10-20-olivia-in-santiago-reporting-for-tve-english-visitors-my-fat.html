<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It is Sunday
again and the Indian summer continued until yesterday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Believe it or not I swam again this week, on
Wednesday, but now it is cool and rain is threatening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The week has been quiet but has had its
highlights as you will read below.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<br></br>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Monday was my
fasting day which always makes me feel good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I worked from home and my Father, Eladio and I enjoyed watching Olivia
on the TV from Santiago reporting on the case of the murdered 12 year old
adopted Chinese girl, Asunta.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She was to
report all week on the case but was so busy she hardly had time to warn
us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You can see her here on Monday via
this <a href="http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/la-manana/saber-vivir-14-10-13/2064247/">link</a> if you go to 10.19h. She was joined in Galicia on Monday by Miguel
her boyfriend who actually travelled there on the train famous now for the
accident this summer.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I was busy on
Monday as that was the day we finally sent our press release to announce our
new convergent (fixed and mobile) tariff which would be commercially available
from 16<sup><span style="font-size: x-small;">th</span></sup> October.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>There has
been much expectation around them and now that they are live, it is an exciting
time for Yoigo.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<br></br>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Tuesday saw me
in the office for various errands and home again for lunch with Eladio and my
Father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Of note that day Spain dealt
swiftly with Georgia in its last qualifying match for the World Cup in Brazil
next year and goes through comfortably as one of the 8 top seeds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>England also got through but not as a top seeder
I’m afraid.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<br></br>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Wednesday I
fasted again instead of on Thursday as the next day I had a dinner to attend
(more about that further on). Meanwhile Olivia was on TV again but never told
us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However I was able to see her later
via streaming and was proud to see her interviewing Rosario Porto’s
lawyer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Rosario Porto is the Mother of
Asunta and is accused of having killed her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Olivia was very professional in her questioning of the lawyer and
cornered him on occasion. Well done Oli.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>You can see it <a href="http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/la-manana/manana-entrevista-exclusiva-abogado-rosario-porto-yo-he-aconsejado-vea-alfonso/2076088/">here</a> if you go to 11.55 (ends around 12.31).<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">That day we
received the visit of English visitors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>John (husband of my great friend Jacky – we go back to our childhood
days in Bradford) and his son Rafi who were down from Murcia to collect Rafi’s
visa for Israel, came to stay the night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>They arrived in the early afternoon and slept a very long siesta after
having got up that morning at around 3 to drive to Madrid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>As they slept their siesta I took the plunge
again in our pool – soon to be covered – as the temperature rose to about 26ºc
that afternoon. It was a pleasure to host John and Rafi later that evening,
whilst Eladio was away at his UNED (sort of Open University) tutorials.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We sat by the pool with the dogs, enjoying an
English cup of tea – then coke, then wine and whatever was available and
enjoyed marvelous conversation in English. Later Eladio joined us for a meal
made by Fátima (tortilla, runner beans with garlic, ham and Eton Mess) which
unfortunately I could not partake of due to my fasting; but judging by how the
men tucked in it must have been great.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<br></br>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It was not
until breakfast the next day with John and Rafi, that my Father, animatedly
telling us about his trip to Bergen in Norway in 1939 when the war broke out, reminded
us that the day before, Wednesday 16<sup><span style="font-size: x-small;">th</span></sup> October, was his 8<sup><span style="font-size: x-small;">th</span></sup>
anniversary with us. It’s amazing to think he has now been with us for 8
years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He came in 2005 the year I left
Nokia when he was 86 and enjoyed many a holiday with us in Spain and in England
and on his own too, to his favourite destinations: Copenhagen, Berlin and
Helsinki.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He was still travelling abroad
on his own until he was nearly 90!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So
now you see where my travelling bug comes from.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

English visitors had to go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But just
before they left I took this delightful photo of them with a partial view of
our house in the background.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I do hope
one day that John will come back but with Jacky this time, who told me she has
never yet visited Madrid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We look
forward to that Jacky; please don’t take too long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Ah and all our best wishes to Rafi in his exciting
year ahead working for the Anglican Church, Christchurch in Jerusalem where he
was born.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Thursday was
very busy for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was results day.
TeliaSonera, our mother company was publishing their third quarter results and
of course I had to do the same locally for Yoigo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was up at 7 for an early conference call
with my communications colleagues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Then
I had to listen to the webcast of the press conference and at 11 I had another
conference call with the new head of Mobility Services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Yoigo’s results were good, despite the fierce
competition in Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You can read about
them <a href="http://www.yoigo.com/sobreyoigo/alertas.php">here </a>in our media alert which we sent out that morning.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<br></br>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">That evening I
had a professional appointment at a prize giving dinner for the telecoms sector
in Spain organized by one of the sector’s news portals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The prizes usually depend on the amount of
advertising the portal gets so, as my company hasn’t advertised on it, I was
not surprised to see we didn’t get a prize.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>The other toll you have to pay for not advertising is the odd negative
article about your company.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But I refuse
to give in. That sort of practice goes against my grain, however the good thing
about the event on Thursday is that anyone who is anyone from the sector
usually goes and the dinner held this year at the magnificent Hotel Palace, was
no exception.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was great to see my
colleagues from Motorola and Nokia now spread all over the sector, as well as
the telecom journalists and my counterparts from the telco companies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was a good night; one to remember.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The food was delicious, although funnily
enough what we were served was different to what was written on the printed menu.
The photo illustrating this week’s post is of me with some of the journalists
and communications directors that night.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<br></br>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Friday I
was up early as I am every day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I love
to get up early and get the most out of the day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had to go into the office again, this time
for an interview with my boss by a journalist to be published in the
prestigious Catalan newspaper, La Vanguardia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I think it went well but won’t know the outcome, of course, until it is
published.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<br></br>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">That morning
whilst I was at work, Olivia was on the television most of the morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However I was only able to watch her
later.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You can too if you click <a href="http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/la-manana">here</a> and
go to 11.40 (ends 12.19) and 13.49 (ends 13.58).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That morning she got a scoop in an exclusive
interview with the same lawyer as before; an interview that was broadcast not
only on her own programme, La Mañana de la 1, but on others too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She came back very happy that night from
Galicia having even been congratulated at work for her efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></div>
<br></br>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">That night at
dinner with Eladio at Ginos, again we talked about our lovely girls and how
well they are doing professionally. Earlier that afternoon I had a long
conversation with Susana who was very tired after lots of events this
week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She keeps sending me photos of the
food that they serve at the events, when I would far prefer to see photos of
her. She did send me this photo which she said was taken at some fantastic
building, but I can’t remember which.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">She was a
little disgruntled on the phone telling me she had to work the next day
Saturday and would miss precious time to be with Chati and her Mother and
sister Elena who went to London at the end of this week to see them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I reminded her that not so long ago she was
disgruntled about not having a job and that she should “thank her lucky stars”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Yesterday Saturday, was her first day working
on a weekend; something that doesn’t happen often but may well become the norm
as Christmas approaches and the events intensify.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She is, however, thoroughly enjoying the job
but of course still learning the ropes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Saturday was
once again the highlight of the week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Again
it started early and saw me making our lunch straight after breakfast and Eladio
and I going food shopping at about 10.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Normally I do the food shopping with Fátima but she took Thursday and
Friday off this week to finish off her paper work which will give her legal
status in Spain and for which she is so grateful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>After our most efficient shopping (I do this
in record time!), off we went again, this time to Gran Plaza 1 (shopping mall)
to pick up some trousers for Eladio at Massimo Dutti (Zara’s up market
brand).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Here I insisted on buying him
some elegant <a href="http://www.google.es/imgres?imgurl=http://www.zapatos.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/200/files/zapatos-hombre-massimo-dutti/zapato-massimo-dutti-verde.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.zapatos.org/2013/05/30/hombres-perfectos-con-zapatos-massimo-dutti/&amp;h=503&amp;w=589&amp;sz=65&amp;tbnid=uCMP615biC5gvM:&amp;tbnh=90&amp;tbnw=105&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__smQR_-btsDMnP9nofiYKCDdq_a8=&amp;docid=TeHgMxQu8ixK0M&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=E7hjUqzqDIjNtAa5hoGADg&amp;ved=0CEYQ9QEwAA">green suede brogue shoes</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>He never wants to buy anything new and I always have to insist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However, later that night when he wore them
to dinner, he admitted he loved them.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">When you are
shopping you can get peckish so off we went for a cup of coffee to Vait.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Here I tried my first ever “cronut” (of New
York origin it is half donut half croissant) and I must say it was
delicious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thus I was not very hungry at
lunch. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Miguel and Olivia joined us and
we had a feast, as you can see from the photo of my plate of “cocido madrlieño”
a staple winter dish I make occasionally and which we all love.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

it rained yesterday afternoon and we had to sacrifice our walk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That evening we had another dinner date.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was late, at 10.30 pm, in Madrid with our
friends Juana and Oscar, Julio and Fátima.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It was to celebrate Juana’s promotion at Microsoft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She is now head of Enterprise sales in Western
Europe and some of the companies she is responsible for are very close to us
all: Nokia, TeliaSonera and Ericsson.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We
all originally met at Nokia, so last night of course, we commented a lot on the
recent purchase of Nokia Mobile Phones by Microsoft. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I also said that so much had happened in the
sector since we first met in 2000 and wondered what our conversation would be
like if we were to have dinner together in 10 years time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Here is a photo of all of us around the table
at <a href="http://conlaya.es/">Conlaya</a>, a restaurant which specializes in food from Cantabria and which we
all enjoyed.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

Sunday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I am writing my blog in the
morning, so as to feel free after lunch and to be able to finish the DVD of The
Cazalets, based on the 4 books I read recently by Elizabeth Jane Howard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In a way it reminds me of Downton Abbey and
is highly recommendable.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
