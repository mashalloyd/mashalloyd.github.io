</tbody></table><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">You are probably wondering why we are staying here and the reason is that in Israel we decided to go for more authentic vs modern top hotels, so’s to get a flavour of the country.  Originally I had tried to get rooms in similar accommodation within the city walls but everything was booked at the time.  It’s a 15 minute walk from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa_Gate">Jaffa Gate </a>(the heart of the old city) and has magnificent views.  We have a balcony and a sparse but comfortable room.  I suppose this is because the place is Scottish.  I was therefore not surprised to hear that breakfast is from 07 to 09h hours only.  Tomorrow is Sunday and there will be a service at the Presbyterian church here which I have threatened to take Eladio to.  The place is something of an icon in Jerusalem, built in 1930 to commemorate the Scots who died liberating the land from Turkish rule during the First World War. The place has an air of days gone past, the only problem being it has turned rather shabby and even grimey in parts.  On the plus side it is real haven of peace after the mad and bustling old city.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></br>

</tbody></table><div class="MsoNormal"></div><div class="MsoNormal">Now let me tell you a bit about my impressions so far.  It was 30ºc when we landed at just before 16h (one hour ahead of Spain); nice and not humid. The landscape in the one hour journey from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem reminded me very much of the arid landscapes you get in most Mediterranean countries.  The vegetation is similar and I saw lots of eucalyptus and pine trees but also a lot of semi desert.  I read in the guidebook that nearly half of Israel is a desert.  However the Israelis have made miracles out of such dry terrain and are big exporters of fruit and vegetables.  I did see some crops, notably vineyards but funnily enough no villages for miles until we reached the outskirts of Jerusalem.  The houses, as you might expect, have flat roofs and are mostly white.  I began to see housing as we approached the city and most of it was white made of limestone and perched on the hills.  Later when I saw the houses close up, many of them had water deposits on their roofs like in India which I thought very odd. </div><div class="MsoNormal">Our arrival coincided with the Jewish Sabbath (Saturday, but like our Sunday) so there was little traffic.  Our rather delapidated Sherut took an hour to drop us off as it had to drop the other passengers off before.  We spoke to various of them including an American girl from Florida who had come here to study “Disaster Management in Humanitarian Aid”.  I suppose this is the right part of the world to study something like that. </div><div class="MsoNormal">Keen to explore the town, we asked Ibrahim from the guesthouse reception for a map and instructions how to get to the old town which you can actually see from our room but is tricky to reach if you don’t know the way.  So we stepped outside, camera in hand and eager to see what we could of Jerusalem in the little time we had left  before sunset.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></br>
