Well now that we are nearly all sorted out, with most things in their place and many missing, of course, we’re going through a settling in period.   Sometimes I have the feeling I’m on holiday or in a hotel – especially when I go in our super duper bathroom.  And when we talk about “home” we usually mean our old house.  It is our house ok but it still doesn’t feel like home.  I think these things take time.<br></br><br></br>Some things are frustrating.  We have 4 tvs , 3 digital receivers and  2 aerial men have been and gone and we still can only get Tele 5 on one of the TVs.  The problem there is that I only really ever watch one programme a week and that is “Hospital Central” on Tele 5! And the one TV I can see it on is the only TV the World Cup can be watched on, so yes, a bit frustrating.  To get even more football, we are getting Canal + installed but they are having trouble with putting the antenna on the roof as they hadn’t expected such a big house.<br></br><br></br>We are very “home bound” at the moment and tend to live in our own little world only going out occasionally to do the shopping.  Our only other outing is our daily walk which is not as nice as the one at our old house, but the exercise is the same, thank God. So we must start to socialize again.  One way will be with the housewarming party on the 8th July next which I am busily preparing in my mind.  The invitation has gone out already though.  Something lovely to look forward to. <br></br><br></br>The girls are having their 2nd housewarming party tonight and there will be more than 30 guests.  A barbecue has been planned and dear Susi bought nearly all the meat there was in Carrefour.  Thank God Eladio and I are going out to dinner!  The problem is that when we get back at 11ish their party will only just be starting and it takes place on the terrace just beneath our bedroom., so there is no escaping it.  Well you never know, we may just join them.<br></br><br></br>The family are fine.  My poor Father is dealing with the hot weather as best he can but confessed the other day that his favourite month in Spain is January!  Eladio has lost 3 kgs thanks to the removal and is now worried he is on the decline or getting old and is bent on eating more than usual.  It’s very funny.  I wish I had lost weight with the move.  I am losing but the rhythm is about a kilo or less a month.  I think the ice-cream a day (Magnum) might have something to do with that.  The girls are going through the end of term, just before the Summer hols phase and are have finished their  exams.  Susi just has to finish a dissertation on food hygiene.  So, of course, it’s Summer party time.<br></br><br></br>And that’s all for the moment folks<br></br><br></br>All my love<br></br>Masha<br></br>PS Sorry no pics again.  Blogger just won't upload them and I don't know what the solution is.
