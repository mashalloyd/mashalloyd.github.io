We have now been here for nearly a week. Before I recount our time here, let me wind back to last Sunday when we were still at our house in Eladio's village, Montrondo.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As we were leaving the next day we had to wash the sheets and towels and Eladio performed a task outside which I had to record. You see he was sharpening his father's old scythe which he would later use to cut down the grass in the field behind our house. That is not something many people use these days. For Eladio it is a symbol of his youth. As a boy, he used it every summer with his father to cut the grass from their fields to make hay for the cows and it was hard work. Thus he is something of an expert. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimq5BwYUr_8l033jeDRPqtICgTlULwb3tXlZmgIQtpLPFF62ZdzkG0p6BY5rZaZpUfLLWJrbg-GoIj1KRqfwlmjwR8GUrJrHasUSaX8xSwq1bwfZcTTHuI8hiPrvHcdVL0AQBFQhRiDNrblgApu-CaP6opXmoN_iagpdmIJ8Hnbo1zA28NdJU/s4032/20220612_102517.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimq5BwYUr_8l033jeDRPqtICgTlULwb3tXlZmgIQtpLPFF62ZdzkG0p6BY5rZaZpUfLLWJrbg-GoIj1KRqfwlmjwR8GUrJrHasUSaX8xSwq1bwfZcTTHuI8hiPrvHcdVL0AQBFQhRiDNrblgApu-CaP6opXmoN_iagpdmIJ8Hnbo1zA28NdJU/w180-h400/20220612_102517.jpg" width="180"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio sharpening his father's old scythe</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">Not many people know how to use one and in Montrondo probably only those aged 65 or more.  A scythe in Spanish is called a "guadaña" in Spanish and I just loved watching my multi task and multi talented husband sharpen his. Thus I did a little interview in which I asked him what a scythe was used for, how he learned to use it and his memories of using it when he was young. You can watch the interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mVBKt9FAak">here on my YouTube channel</a>. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">My husband has his feet firmly on the ground, having been brought up on a farm in rural and poor Spain just after the Civil War. He is so cultured too as you know and that I think that is one of the things that most attracted me to him. In the car on the way here, he and his brother were talking about their education at the seminary in León where they suffered much hardship but learned so much. At one stage in the conversation my husband, who last week recited verses  to me in French from a poem by Victor Hugo, this week recited whole passages from the Bible in  Hebrew; verses and verses. I have heard him before reciting passages from the bible in both Greek and Latin but never in Hebrew.  What a memory he has or rather what a superb education he had.   I was once again amazed by him. He didn't think he had done anything special but oh he had at least in my eyes. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">But back to last Sunday in Montrondo. It was a lovely sunny day and that morning we went on the short but beautiful walk to the nearest village, Murias. I love Montrondo in June when nature is at its best. We took the old path where the grass had grown quite high and was still a little wet from the rain the day before. The sun shone though and soon everything would be dry.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg1WjX5qJUiKqo_95l064jvXDl_BUYqEyp39PyCYJ5yAsTh3FQE_cT6YI61HDsBJ2yvvf1mXw2aED-_4G9IyYQzGxg0rdIhdilYJEtXU62Pv4dNsPTJhcc2PsFoUTFz3NCk9Aefkd8wRevp2UEBCxFnDiqRdr_apokyYvbibCGGGvJYI8QM3cU/s2016/IMG-20220612-WA0020.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg1WjX5qJUiKqo_95l064jvXDl_BUYqEyp39PyCYJ5yAsTh3FQE_cT6YI61HDsBJ2yvvf1mXw2aED-_4G9IyYQzGxg0rdIhdilYJEtXU62Pv4dNsPTJhcc2PsFoUTFz3NCk9Aefkd8wRevp2UEBCxFnDiqRdr_apokyYvbibCGGGvJYI8QM3cU/w400-h195/IMG-20220612-WA0020.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>On our walk to Murias last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">We came home for a coffee as there are no bars open at midday in Murias and while my husband cut the grass in the fields with his sharpened scythe.  I made our lunch: "bacalhau à brás". Sorry I didn't take a pic. </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile Oli and her family were in the middle of their beach holiday in Oliva in the Valencia region. I was happy to see a super photo of Elliot in his element on the beach. He is so big now and not yet 3 and isn't he lovely?</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEicHR8zwGtWEjTfLxsMMGMDRT3xgFCZI1pxNjhaI4KdbMZEJK4zGwRoeCCp8ul-49g1FJ5bc7lJyOy_cR9xffYzbqf-3NC4DIgxWDKmY3-x_A7MKtqGINb7uWkBDZhATGo4Pz6EdZ7iowCHPQTctr9KkDM0tY3XrCLun9Cfg2t7qI60oI7y2gs/s1600/IMG-20220612-WA0019.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEicHR8zwGtWEjTfLxsMMGMDRT3xgFCZI1pxNjhaI4KdbMZEJK4zGwRoeCCp8ul-49g1FJ5bc7lJyOy_cR9xffYzbqf-3NC4DIgxWDKmY3-x_A7MKtqGINb7uWkBDZhATGo4Pz6EdZ7iowCHPQTctr9KkDM0tY3XrCLun9Cfg2t7qI60oI7y2gs/w225-h400/IMG-20220612-WA0019.jpg" width="225"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Elliot looking radiant last Sunday in Oliva</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div><p style="text-align: justify;">The afternoon was quiet and most of Eladio's family left in the late afternoon. It was our last night in the village and everything was peaceful. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">I was awake just before 7 am on Monday morning. We had aimed to leave at 10.30 and at 10.30 we left. Coming with us were Eladio's brother and wife, Toño and Dolores. It was to be their first trip to Asturias to see our "new house". So it was goodbye Montrondo. I took one last look at the house and wanted to share this photo with you. We finished building it in 2015 and are still in love with it. The only drawback and it is quite a big one  is that it is sandwiched in between two other houses that belong to Eladio's family. That's because it was the original family house and the buildings next to it were annexes which have now been turned into houses. We really should have built a new house on a different plot of land in the village but never thought about it at the time. In any case we still love it. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhgEquKqSZ8E69xLi7AsSOLeKLOY_r1UUMpNroCambh71BGGlwRdsCLcxB1HZ4wwZfa5xjY1KXvf_nCnRwESaax97HftFhQIaTSrlDPZSbzV96j24DQYta3Hy8whfo4yB4263RIJ7-Xn0GTPdkF1VVuHFTCiRdEqCKd6fPaSNNhUrVM6qOpy5Q/s1816/IMG_20220613_103342_998.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhgEquKqSZ8E69xLi7AsSOLeKLOY_r1UUMpNroCambh71BGGlwRdsCLcxB1HZ4wwZfa5xjY1KXvf_nCnRwESaax97HftFhQIaTSrlDPZSbzV96j24DQYta3Hy8whfo4yB4263RIJ7-Xn0GTPdkF1VVuHFTCiRdEqCKd6fPaSNNhUrVM6qOpy5Q/w400-h400/IMG_20220613_103342_998.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our house in Montrondo.</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">The journey to El Cuetu takes 2.5 hours. Montrondo is in the province of León, next to Asturias but El Cuetu is on the far east side of Asturias, bordering on Cantabria so is quite far away. We stopped for a coffee at a bar in Campomanes, got lost a bit and finally arrived in Llanes - that lovely coastal town -  about 14km from us - at 2 pm. We were to have lunch there but first I wanted to go to Aramburu, that gourmet store, to get provisions mainly for our dinners. </div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Lunch was at the Hotel El Sablon right next to the town beach of the same name. It was cloudy and grey but warm; typical of Asturias and people were actually bathing.

I wondered what our guests would think of the house. We love it but it has its faults too. After settling in, Dolores and I drove to Posada to get more provisions while the men sat on the terrace outside the house talking. They like being together. Later we joined them over a bottle of Rueda wine and pistachios before we had a rather too heavy dinner in the kitchen.</div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">I think we all slept well that night. On <b>Tuesday</b> morning I woke up to grey skies. I just hoped the sun would come out for our guests to enjoy El Cuetu and surroundings in the sunshine.  It was warm and the sun did come out later as often happens here. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">If I was happy to be back, so was Pippa, our miniature chocolate dachshund. Here she is asking to go in the house. Notice all the geraniums.

We stuck to his plan, except that it was market day and in between the coffee and lunch, Dolores and I had a field day as we both adore markets.

We came home to rest. Everyone did their own thing. My thing was to read outside on the terrace. This week I enjoyed a book by the  Afghan doctor Waheed Arian .  Called "<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wars-story-conflict-survival-saving/dp/1787633969">In the wars</a>", I  was inspired to read it after I saw an article in The Times about this heroic and inspiring man who survived the Red Army, the Taliban, and made his way to the UK where he was imprisoned at the age of 15. Remarkably he went on to study medicine, his lifelong dream, at Cambridge and today works for the NHS. But he is much more than that and his story is very inspiring. This is my sort of book and I loved it. </div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Later we all convened around the table on our modest terrace. We also did some "gardening" or rather pruning and watering of the flowers which were wilting quite a lot. I was happy with the result. And as we dud the day before, we had an "aperitivo" on the terrace before dinner. This time it was local cider and some fancy crisps. Here is Eladio pouring the cider which you have to do from as high as you can so as that it has more sparkle. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEizVdEaBXiV5Sja5sph0TvrXak1CYPj5fjvKN65iUw2msS9IP4fX8j2F_NGIg1II264e6ZMYTVUh6UeowGaa9SO34wQPv2Man5geyMd_mDd9FPT8vvFWIvtzc6R-1q2EM1S_PyjGfnR516gD64sKimAtA4yC70xulrovFhMwhH_1VcSHu_0o8g/s4032/Cider%20moment.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEizVdEaBXiV5Sja5sph0TvrXak1CYPj5fjvKN65iUw2msS9IP4fX8j2F_NGIg1II264e6ZMYTVUh6UeowGaa9SO34wQPv2Man5geyMd_mDd9FPT8vvFWIvtzc6R-1q2EM1S_PyjGfnR516gD64sKimAtA4yC70xulrovFhMwhH_1VcSHu_0o8g/w400-h180/Cider%20moment.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Cider with crisps (not with Rosie) on Tuesday evening. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We didn't have dinner proper until 10 pm.

We decided it was to be a beach day and took along our swimming costumes, flip flops and towels. We wanted to show Toño and Dolores our favourite beach, the one with the unfortunate name of Póo which has no meaning in Spanish btw. It was sunny when we left the village but the beach was covered in clouds and the views which are usually so spectacular with the backdrop of the Picos de Europa mountains were not visible. It felt strange. However the sun was out in parts and it was very warm with people on the beach. We had a coffee first at the hotel there which, if we didn't have a house in the area, would be the ideal location for a holiday.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsiGXCxm7cIR2GqCYtOjZJqvJ5d8RjjeAy6NPYTvGoq_vwt_oN8K9vlCiQ3w7XXIeLEkNMypH-N8qggmcidI2dOWXhE0b1eNmqp_sdBqyxYgmiOQi_mFpGUou4Ss2dYNtcQTlTuB7g2wMdZQaEkVZv6EgncRX8XhVVHDRgOVxrKkDhIWftvaY/s4032/Eladio%20coffee.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgsiGXCxm7cIR2GqCYtOjZJqvJ5d8RjjeAy6NPYTvGoq_vwt_oN8K9vlCiQ3w7XXIeLEkNMypH-N8qggmcidI2dOWXhE0b1eNmqp_sdBqyxYgmiOQi_mFpGUou4Ss2dYNtcQTlTuB7g2wMdZQaEkVZv6EgncRX8XhVVHDRgOVxrKkDhIWftvaY/w400-h180/Eladio%20coffee.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Coffee by the clouded beach of Póo on Wednesday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The tide was out and, similar to lots of English beaches, we had to walk quite a way to the edge of the water.

We had booked a table at "El Roxin", quite a famous restaurant and funny that there should be one in such a village. However, El Mazuco is well known for fighting during the Spanish Civil War - apparently 2000 people lost their lives there. It has also featured in the odd Spanish film. What Mazuco has going for it though are the views of the valley below. The road leads to Llanes but it is a torturous one. "Roxin" has its own farm and everything they serve comes from it or at least that is what it says on the menu. Eladio and Toño went for the goat stew and Dolores and I had lamb chops. Both were delicious but the portions were so big, we took a doggy bag home which would be next day's lunch. </div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">As we walked out of the restaurant I admired the view from the village.

Later we all convened on the terrace where we sat most evenings. However we had to go out, leaving our magical place, to buy some milk for our breakfasts. I drove and Dolores went with me to Puente Nuevo where the nearest shop is located. Once home, I realised I had left my phone at the shop. I wasn't much worried as people in this area are known for their honesty in general. Had it been Seville for example I probably wouldn't have got it back but I did. </div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We had our aperitif at around 9 - pistachios, almonds and cider - which meant I was not hungry for dinner. No one was really.

It was going to be even warmer that day and I was determined I would get my bathe on one of the local beaches. We did my friends and it was marvelous. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As usual though we had a leisurely breakfast. Every day here I have arranged a buffet breakfast in the mornings as each and every one of us has a radically different choice.  Eladio goes for kefir with fruit, sultanas and walnuts.  Dolores has cottage cheese with marmalade, Toñó has toast, fruit and yoghurt and I, as you probably know, always have porridge and an orange with coffee of course. We then did some washing. Usually here as it is quite damp, clothes take a long time to dry but not on Thursday which was possibly the warmest day here with temperatures reaching an unheard of 30ºc, 10 degrees less than in Madrid though. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Every morning too we have tended to the flowers, the geraniums and hydrangeas which in this heat need water every day. When we came they were all wilted. Now they look splendid after all my dead heading and Eladio's watering. Without them the house would not look as pretty as it does.

We could have bathed there but we were keen to show our guests other beaches. There are so many in the area of Llanes it is difficult to choose.  Llanes has 50km of coast and 38 beaches! Although Póo is my favourite, I love all of them. We drove on towards Celorio and stopped at the Playa de Borizo where we had once been and it was so windy we had to turn back. But not on Thursday. It was a marvelous day, the perfect beach day and I was determined to bathe. We didn't have beach chairs so had to make do with sitting on rocks and on the sand. As soon as we were in our bathing costumes, Eladio and I made a beeline to the water with Pippa following us. I should point out that she hates water and always avoids it. However, she found herself in a difficult situation as she wanted to be with us and hesitatingly followed us, although she was terrified of the water. Before she had to swim, which she hates, I scooped her up in my arms like a baby and took her out of the sea. Fortunately Toño and Dolores were on the shore and they were her refuge. The water was marvelous with the odd wave to surf over and not too cold. Oh how I loved my first bathe in this area since shortly after we bought the house in September 2020. </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Later we had to wash and dry Pippa who was still trembling poor lamb. I then kept her wrapped in a towel until she left  - like a baby hahha.  She wouldn't be going in the water again.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-VJPqHxHL-pKW_xjAW5EIhY_AhmqKrKyT0wSUBGpTsXFS3kCARRnrOCR-WOzFuWosvzNf3xrI0ITHF3plcvju_8vbsLrucgMU25epgm4uhlMRGVLherizE2rLaY298110M0vucaKcQISX1NJLTKOYe8qeYpVdkPx4UkIR2Jfcg-Zvc1URm6o/s4032/E%20and%20Pippa%20Playa%20de%20Borizo.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-VJPqHxHL-pKW_xjAW5EIhY_AhmqKrKyT0wSUBGpTsXFS3kCARRnrOCR-WOzFuWosvzNf3xrI0ITHF3plcvju_8vbsLrucgMU25epgm4uhlMRGVLherizE2rLaY298110M0vucaKcQISX1NJLTKOYe8qeYpVdkPx4UkIR2Jfcg-Zvc1URm6o/w400-h180/E%20and%20Pippa%20Playa%20de%20Borizo.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Pippa being dried after her adventure in the sea at Playa de Borizo</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We could have had lunch at a nearby restaurant but had lots to eat from doggy bags so went home.

Eladio's brother was keen to visit the pretty seaside town of Comillas in the next province to ours, in Cantabria, near Santander.

On Friday the temperatures reached 39ºc, according to our neighbour in El Cuetu. That is totally unheard of in Asturias and is a clear indication of climate change. I hoped for another bathe in the sea but there wasn't enough time if we wanted to have a coffee at midday, see Comillas, visit the old University and have lunch. Thus we sweltered from the moment we set foot in Comillas. We had a coffee in the main square where there was another market which looked better than the one in Posada. I was in luck that day as I finally found the sandals I had been searching for - flat and white or whitish and the type that cover bunions. I hate my bunions which I inherited from my mother and which she, no doubt, inherited from hers. Never mind about them. The new sandals were perfect, very comfortable and hide my ugly feet. I have a pleasant face, nice green eyes, not a particularly nice body but awful feet hahahha. None of us is every entirely satisfied with our body or maybe a handful of people but very few.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Enough about my feet which I needed to walk back to our car which was sweltering too. We drove to the imposing Seminary, now a private University which of course for my brother-in-law meant so much.

I looked forward to stepping inside the building to feel the cool. We got tickets for a guided visit which turned out to be a wrong choice. The young guide was a bit of a Taliban about the visiting rules - no one could be out of her sight, we couldn't touch anything and of course no dogs. Pippa stayed outside in the extreme heat but in the shade. The guide spent about half an hour on the steps in the strong sunshine explaining the main door. If she took that long to explain the door how long would the visit last? I looked it up on internet and read that it would last 1.5h. Thus we left which wasn't easy as we were not allowed to leave alone as the guide had to have the whole group within eyesight. Once outside and on our way to the car with Pippa we were told off by the security guard for taking a dog with us in the grounds!!! I left thinking what awful rules and staff. One saving grace though was the view from above. From the main door I spied the Castle of the Marquess of Comillas and a beautiful church designed by the famous Catalan architect, Gaudi. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgUkkp8-WD48BNB9559TsdH4-VXzt2X3OHMwDa8HAcOLBME73yMUg647CQLr4o-Cno8JA0M0xmmKPxXU57nkEoM4cORV-kWL6xW2IyEym-Th05CkaZZ88UtfPLKkdclnvvZStadURvn7zAr__VNWc7U5DkLDLAU1j2S9_xWr-XBZH9Ss1m6giQ/s4032/views%20from%20seminary.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgUkkp8-WD48BNB9559TsdH4-VXzt2X3OHMwDa8HAcOLBME73yMUg647CQLr4o-Cno8JA0M0xmmKPxXU57nkEoM4cORV-kWL6xW2IyEym-Th05CkaZZ88UtfPLKkdclnvvZStadURvn7zAr__VNWc7U5DkLDLAU1j2S9_xWr-XBZH9Ss1m6giQ/w400-h180/views%20from%20seminary.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The view from the old University in Comillas on Friday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">By then it was time for lunch and we headed to the small village of Caviedes where we had booked a table at a restaurant called <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g2569618-d2490655-Reviews-Casa_Cofino-Caviedes_Cantabria.html">Cofiño</a>. It was recommended to us by our friend Gerardo who knows the area like the back of his hand. I couldn't believe the heat when we got out of the car. Once again no dogs were allowed so Pippa had to stay outside tied to a tree in the shade. We gave her a bowl of water. She drank it gratefully. Before we left I poured a whole bowl of fresh water all over her for her to cool down. It wasn't exactly cool in the restaurant where I imagine they use the air con about 3 times a year but that day it could have been stronger. Gerardo had recommended the local bean stew (cocido montañes), the fried squid (rabas) and meat balls. He also told us the portions would be enormous. That's no issue here as we always take a doggy bag home.

The forecast was for warm weather - 26ºc - so we decided to take our guests to a new beach, Guadamía, in Pría, near the famous Bufones de Pría (sort of geysers that emerge from rocks in the field) but oh boy the weather forecast was wrong.
