<div class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Hi everyone,</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">How’s your
week been?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Mine has been quiet but
pleasant, thanks to the wonderful Indian summer we are having at the
moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I can’t believe the temperatures
which reached 26ºc this week, but more about that later.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Monday started
as usual with my semi fasting which always feels great after a weekend of
excess and meals out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Eladio hates my
fasting days (Mondays and Thursdays) as it means I don’t have lunch with him
and my Father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But my waistline is very
grateful for the sacrifice.</span><br></br>
 </div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Tuesday saw me
in the office for various errands and mini meetings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had lunch that day with Javier and Dragutin
who took me to a great place called La Bandeja.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I wish I had taken a photo but we were far too engrossed in conversation
to remember.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I later heard
on the news that this year’s <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2013/press.html">Nobel Physics prize</a> went unsurprisingly to Peter
Higgs (and </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">François Englert) for the now famous Higgs Boson.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I can’t begin to explain what it is but what
I found more interesting was the fact that the Swedish Academy of Sciences had
been unable to locate the Scottish Professor and went ahead with the
announcement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Later the Professor
revealed that he had heard he had won the prize when a woman stopped him in the
street to congratulate him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I think he
must be one of the few scientists in the world who does not use a mobile phone.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Thursday,
my second fasting day of the week, the illiterate world, amongst which I
include myself, learned who <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24477246">Alice Munro</a> is when the Nobel Committee announced
her as this year’s Laureate in Literature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I was happy to hear a woman had won, only the 13<sup>th</sup> and
interested to find out that she is the master of short stories and often
likened to Chekhov, who I’m afraid I haven’t read either (my Father has of
course).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She is the second Canadian ever
to win the prize and at 83 confessed that she was really surprised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It was on
Thursday that the temperature soared to 26c and I suddenly realised we were in
the middle of an Indian summer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was
so hot I actually took the plunge and went in the pool.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The photo illustrating this week’s post is of
that moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I think I have never swum
in our pool in October.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Funnily enough the
water was freezing but when I got out I didn’t feel at all cold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was a great experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Hopefully the current weather will carry on
next week too and Eladio will postpone covering the pool for the winter. I went
on to swim again on Friday whilst sunbathing and reading, no not Alice Munro,
but the fourth book in the Cazalet Chronicles I am thoroughly enjoying about a
quaint rich English family’s life during the second world war in England.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Remember I was prompted by the Duchess of
Cornwall who was caught reading the saga.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Friday the
motor car world was devastated to hear that the 33 year old Spaniard María de
Villota, a Formula 1 test driver, had been <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/24487701">found dead </a>in her bed in a hotel in
Seville.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>María, a vivacious and
beautiful girl lost her right eye in a crash while testing for the Marussia
team last year in England.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However she
survived and went on to get married this summer and was to present her
autobiography: “Life is a gift” this Monday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It is ironic that she died just a few days before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The family later informed her death was
related to the accident when she lost her eye.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Spain and the motor car world mourn her death.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It was on
Friday too that the Nobel Peace prize 2013 was to be announced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>A favourite contender was Malala Yousafzai,
the Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by the Taliban for advocating education
for girls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She survived the attack and
now lives in Birmingham and has become an icon for peace through education and
admired the world over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Inspired by the
news she may become the Peace prize winner, I read more about her and learned
she had written (or co written) a biography “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0297870912/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_asp_dIvJG.0BSA8RG">I am Malala</a>” which I immediately
bought on Amazon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I look forward to
reading it after the Cazalet Chronicles – different sort of read right?</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">In the end she
didn’t win the Nobel Prize but this week was awarded the European Union
Sakharov Prize and she even met President Obama.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It’s incredible to think how her life has
changed since living in the remote Swat area of Pakistan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was disappointed she didn’t, but thought it
was very fair that the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2013/press.html">prize finally went to the </a><span style="color: black;"><a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2013/press.html">Organizationfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)</a> who right now is the organization
monitoring Syria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Most countries in the
world, except those you probably expect don’t, belong to the organization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However two countries that don’t really
should.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Shame on Russia and the United
States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I mean, how can President Obama criticize
Syria in its use of chemical warfare if the US is one of the major manufacturers
of the ammunition!? It doesn’t make sense to me. </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Friday I am
sure none of these issues were important to my daughter Susana who lives in
London.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was on Friday that she was to
supervise an event at Oxo on her own for the first time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I later spoke to her on the phone and she is
enjoying her job more and more every day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It’s funny to think that both my daughters have, in their own way,
followed in my footsteps.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I do PR and
events as a Communications Manager and Olivia is a journalist and now Suzy
works in events.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She posted a photo of a
wonderful bottle of wine she was given at a Spanish wine tasting event in the
presence of the Spanish Ambassador in London.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Olivia remarked; “just like Mummy”, in that if you work in events, you
always end up getting given the odd “give away” or promotional gift. I asked
for a photo but Suzy was too busy to send me one.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Eladio and I
talked about this at dinner on Friday night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Well I mean, we always talk about our daughters at our Friday evening
dinners out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This week, for the record,
we tried somewhere new and very nearby: <a href="http://www.latagliatella.es/restaurantes/latagliatella-boadilladelmonte-infantedonluis/">La Tagliatella</a>, a great Italian place
where we found out that the portions are gigantic.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Saturday was
this week’s highlight and it started off well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I always read The Times and The Telegraph online in the mornings over
breakfast in the kitchen with Olivia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So
when I started reading <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/comedy/10363116/Tommy-Cooper-25-great-jokes.html?fb">this article</a>, I just burst out laughing which had Olivia
and then Eladio most surprised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You see
I was reading about Tommy Cooper, the English comedian I never really liked but
whose jokes I found hilarious on Saturday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I particularly found funny that he was also a joker off stage and used
to give taxi drivers an envelope after paying, saying “have a drink on me”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They would then open the envelope to find a
tea bag!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>If you find that funny you will
find some of his best one or two liners even more so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I particularly liked: “I was on a whisky diet
last week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I lost three days” and “two
cannibals were eating a clown and one said to the other, “does he taste funny?”.
Eladio’s favourite was: “</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">I told the waiter, bring me a chicken. So he brought me a
chicken. 'Just a minute,' I said, 'It's only got one leg. 'It's been in a
fight.' I said, 'Well, bring me the winner.”</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Thus my mood was at an all high when
Olivia and I set off for a shopping expedition. She wanted to buy presents for
a 50s themed birthday party she was going to at lunch time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Dave turned 29 on Friday, Ana turned 30 this
week and it was also to celebrate Pulgi’s 27<sup>th</sup> birthday; all members
of their group which they call “la manada” (the herd!).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We went to Gran Plaza 2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Funnily enough I didn’t buy any clothes that
morning but indulged in 5 books in English from Fnac.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Olivia went off beautifully dressed
in a supposed 50s style red and white dress with a bow we bought from a cheapo
Chinese shop in Boadilla.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This is what

from McDonalds!</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">I am sure the “manada” sorely missed
Suzy and Chati who now live in London. They would have loved to be there too.
But that day they visited a farm, the <a href="http://stepneycityfarm.org/">Stepney City Farm</a>, as I found out from
photos posted on Facebook by Chati.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Here
is a great photo of the two girls together stroking a donkey.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Meanwhile at home we had my home
made lasagne and then had the usual siesta after which I read from the swimming
pool terrace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I didn’t sunbathe or swim
though as the temperature didn’t rise above 20c.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Later we went for our daily power walk with
the dogs after which we came home to get ready to go to Madrid for a family
dinner.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">We had originally planned to go out
to dinner to <a href="ttp://www.lavacaargentina.net/restaurantes-madrid-paseo-castellana-214">La Vaca Argentina</a> near Plaza Castilla with José Antonio and
Dolores.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So I was very pleasantly
surprised in the morning whilst shopping with Olivia to receive a call from
Pili, my sister in law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She was in town
with her husband Andrés to visit their daughter Paula and her boyfriend
Pedro.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was a reunion weekend with
Pedro’s parents from Málaga, Isa and Esteban and their other son also called
Esteban and Pili suggested they all join us for dinner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thus we had a true big family dinner last
night where there were 11 of us around the table.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This is the best photo I could get of the
occasion. Pili and Andrés very generously invited us all to dinner and it was a
superb evening; one to remember.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">So today,
Sunday, is a bit flat after yesterday. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>On the bright side Oli will be joining us for
our lunch of leftover lasagna.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Later
today she will be travelling to Santiago where all of next week she will be
covering the mysterious case of the 12 year old adopted Chinese girl Ausunta who
was found dead 3 weeks ago and whose parents are suspected of her murder. We
look forward to watching her on TV as we always do, however the house will be
much emptier without her.</span></div>
