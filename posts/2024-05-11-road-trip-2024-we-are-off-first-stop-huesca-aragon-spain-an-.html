That's because our first important destination in France was Carcassonne. Besides, that road has no tolls.  Little did I know how difficult it is to cross that treacherous mountain range.<div><br></br></div><div>We set off at 10.15, stopped at the bank for me to pay the Inland Revenue a nasty fine and get some cash and soon we were on the A2, the road to Zaragoza. We aim not to drive more than 400km a day, so I had booked a night in a small hotel in Huesca which is the halfway mark between Madrid and Carcassonne, in kilometres, not time wise, as I would find out later.  Huesca with a population of around just 50.000, is in the region of Aragon and is the gateway to the Spanish Pyrenees. We had never been there, so this was our chance. It turned out to be a thriving and quite a beautiful provincial town. <div><br></br></div><div>We stopped twice, once for coffee and another time to stretch our legs. Here is a particularly good photo of my husband somewhere in the middle of nowhere that day. I think there are vineyards in the distance. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEinTrjWCYKvlWyWWcXX3drbN00-4dpWBr6LJJskoge_PB3zj12X9oeKXypx0aMwQ9HPY0UqVPm8kaHaiwUinSSHBYFfqQKAjrVTrcFOlMCL_1AFsUcj8uYLYBosLwOs5KtbzZDJnQuy_OtubIiSmNtXv6wIpXsfksaH3MEl7afygUbCxQ8FXCGz0Q/s4032/20240504_132907.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEinTrjWCYKvlWyWWcXX3drbN00-4dpWBr6LJJskoge_PB3zj12X9oeKXypx0aMwQ9HPY0UqVPm8kaHaiwUinSSHBYFfqQKAjrVTrcFOlMCL_1AFsUcj8uYLYBosLwOs5KtbzZDJnQuy_OtubIiSmNtXv6wIpXsfksaH3MEl7afygUbCxQ8FXCGz0Q/w180-h400/20240504_132907.jpg" width="180"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A stop on the way to Huesca</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We were both in a great mood, feeling excited and happy and looking forward to more adventures. It's our prize for all the work we put in during the year.  Besides, we have to make the most of life in this final chapter of our own lives. In my posts on social media, some of my hashtags are "2oldies in a Mini" and "oldies but goldies". The latter was how a young Nabatean bedouin referred to me when he helped me into one of the caves in Petra some years ago.  We have always laughed about that. <div><br></br></div><div>We arrived just after 3 pm at our rather modest but decent hotel, <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/hostal-joaquin-costa.es.html">El Punto Chic</a> 300 metres or so from the centre. Obviously we can't stay at expensive hotels every night, so we go for the cheap and cheerful and only splash out occasionally.  We particularly liked our room because it had a large terrace. It was on that terrace that we ate the packed lunch I had made. Here's a video of our quarters in Huesca. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe class="b-hbp-video b-uploaded" height="266" src="https://www.blogger.com/video.g?token=AD6v5dz4Ol4HuqsBLCD_NFDR_E-dWApHum5sYXcedJlIsNiEMDBtex8uCGZQEEzq0j13VIgFGEIiBQyDy6hUbn9g_yzsYd2665VH3XhFabbHSHlvUl6_aDcjjev3o9oJ3YCW" width="320"></iframe></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Our room at El Punto Chic in Huesca</i></div><div>After a short rest on an incredibly comfortable mattress, we set off on foot to explore Huesca.

We passed a convent, El Monasterio de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción. There was a sign saying it's a cloistered convent - they still exist - but visitors were welcome to visit the beautiful chapel. So in we went. Some of the nuns were visible to us from  behind a glass wall. I only saw 3; one young black girl and 2 very old ladies  who call themselves Servants of God. Eladio was particularly interested in the fact that the Holy Sacrament for communion was on display and lit up. His guess is that the Convent was bestowed with special privileges from the Catholic Church. Oh my. <div><br></br></div><div>Once outside, we soon stumbled across  the Plaza Luis López Allue which looked beautiful with lots of coloured façades on the magnificent buildings. This is where La Confianza is located. Founded in 1871, it claims to be the oldest grocery shop not just in Spain but in Europe. We had to see it and were impressed.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjucustrviUleAKULTMCh6rSIohoQ_ayGC9JLgsA6GG_wRsZ4x3caXG3ZgGGOviAk80m-Nd1ucxxPDM0Qx6Jekr-8JnOLYicGJ6Icabrz_75yivWYTylovVYlcIa-nv-bqBFdeB2wYJK14r8-v2NUy1xtnTtUo9yIjv2WcjZzRTRzV94MnRgD0RQg/s4032/20240504_190544.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjucustrviUleAKULTMCh6rSIohoQ_ayGC9JLgsA6GG_wRsZ4x3caXG3ZgGGOviAk80m-Nd1ucxxPDM0Qx6Jekr-8JnOLYicGJ6Icabrz_75yivWYTylovVYlcIa-nv-bqBFdeB2wYJK14r8-v2NUy1xtnTtUo9yIjv2WcjZzRTRzV94MnRgD0RQg/w180-h400/20240504_190544.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio in La Confianza</i></td></tr></tbody></table>There was a sign on the door saying photos are only permitted if you purchase something. I read somewhere that it is so popular, crowds come and of course don't buy anything. So we bought something - no sweets or chocolate but honey for my husband who adores it and some salami (longaniza). Here is the video which I posted on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkZhajCSuJA">You Tube channel</a> once inside the store. <br></br><div><br></br></div><div>We both fell in love with this oldie worldie shop which is pretty unique and a feast for both the eyes and the stomach.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Our walking tour of the city of Huesca which we found very clean, then took us to a bar by the Porches de Galicia. There I had a glass of wine and enjoyed some people watching and chatting contentedly with my husband. We later continued our walk towards a charming square where an ornate casino is located; Plaza de Navarra which also has a beautiful fountain.  It seemed pretty similar to the one we saw in Kutaisi in Georgia last year. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcLM-zvX8nzdZiaMHYUyYI3le8i7fFR6Y8kQE1u6pd0DFG7TKhHvxjXu1ZbzQqyZxdnnV_lyYRATACZrJhA2VbomuuHbX2tuG4O5S_n4rAJIIb9sbxUbZtq8s6UgNLXOQpnZ7blY23VEvRPEU17ppwhyphenhyphen1TbCT1ATAeff-m_fnk5v7YQVeVxI7q4Q/s3687/20240504_195213.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="196" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcLM-zvX8nzdZiaMHYUyYI3le8i7fFR6Y8kQE1u6pd0DFG7TKhHvxjXu1ZbzQqyZxdnnV_lyYRATACZrJhA2VbomuuHbX2tuG4O5S_n4rAJIIb9sbxUbZtq8s6UgNLXOQpnZ7blY23VEvRPEU17ppwhyphenhyphen1TbCT1ATAeff-m_fnk5v7YQVeVxI7q4Q/w400-h196/20240504_195213.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>In one of the main squares in Huesca- Plaza de Navarra with the casino behind me.</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>We were tired by then as we had walked over 10.000 steps, so headed back to our hotel.

Last Sunday was both Mothers' Day in Spain and Russian Easter. Knowing that, I wrote to Sister Serafima from my Aunt Olga's convent in Sofia whom we met a year ago. Last year she sent us a Guardian Angel. We had no major mishaps and often thought someone or something was guiding us. Thus, I asked her to send us another Guardian Angel for this year's road trip. She very sweetly wrote that the nuns would pray for us and  added: "May God bless you and may your Guardian angels accompany you always wherever you go and in every decision you make!". Thank you dear Sister. </div><div><br></br></div><div>That day we were heading to the medieval town of Carcassonne, supposed to be one of the most beautiful in France. It is famous for its links with the Cathars.  In the 12th to 14th century this was one of the most important religious groups in medieval Europe. <br></br><div><br></br></div><div>What I didn't know was just what a long and difficult journey it would be. We left quite late, owing to the lift not working and to the garage door being closed at our hotel in Huesca. We dutifully followed Google Maps indications which would take us across the Spanish Pyrenees to the French Pyrenees  via the Bielsa-Aragnout cross border tunnel.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Everything was beautiful and green and we appreciated driving along country roads at the feet of the Pyrenees rather than driving on some boring motorway. We stopped for coffee in a pretty little town called Boltaña, about 60km from the French border. Here is Eladio poring over our map while I enjoyed an amazing cappuccino. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVaHVRttqeRzd73FXKAplLVpKRiAFKeuMqdcJnboGAeO7TNrxFQAtov3YQkei42wXuE9KHoxup5_83E84H6tfgY7QyThyRYAlX1yWG-DGnL2L_xUN7BA4o2osTLYM5oX-QOULjEPSyPjzha_EyIePTL-QXPQqq867IyDMI3sHzkA81D0pB7iFWJA/s4032/20240505_122510.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVaHVRttqeRzd73FXKAplLVpKRiAFKeuMqdcJnboGAeO7TNrxFQAtov3YQkei42wXuE9KHoxup5_83E84H6tfgY7QyThyRYAlX1yWG-DGnL2L_xUN7BA4o2osTLYM5oX-QOULjEPSyPjzha_EyIePTL-QXPQqq867IyDMI3sHzkA81D0pB7iFWJA/w180-h400/20240505_122510.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"> <i>A pit stop in the pretty town of Boltaña on our way to France across the Pyrenees</i></td></tr></tbody></table>I took the wheel when we got back in the car but soon regretted it as the road was very steep and windy. We were literally driving through ravines with high mountains. I was interested to know what peaks were near us. It turns out we drove very near the highest mountain in the Pyrenees, the <br></br>Aneto which is 3.404 m high. We also drove near the Pico de Monte Perdido which is the third highest in this mountain range. I was curious to find out the highest peaks are in Spain, not France, but only by a few metres. As I drove, I thought of all those people who crossed the Pyrenees during WW2 and how they were helped by French and Spanish locals. That made me also very curious to find out just how many official border crossings there are between the two countries but I couldn't get a straight answer on internet. What I did find out though is that the Franco-Spanish border is 656km long between north eastern Spain and south western France. No doubt those escaping the Nazis during the War were led across the mountains far from any official border. <br></br><div><br></br></div><div>When we finally got to the Bielsa-Aragnout tunnel, it was raining and there was a queue of traffic as it was only operating on one side.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEheRD-r0c_x46GuW53G3Pd7fdq7fJ0Rh7mcO9e1XTIcWNy_RL2cGh6lZd9YXTZlFzYm7erMeYflLzeutOh4FRBTFaxsNV1oT-HFJO0l6oYXe9jGX_16QzgC-jciowRunP2bZvsbwU6YvXRKsyh7kvenqlJ2ka_5W45qcxOGHg9swL_9NP3JVsxSzA/s4032/20240505_133333.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEheRD-r0c_x46GuW53G3Pd7fdq7fJ0Rh7mcO9e1XTIcWNy_RL2cGh6lZd9YXTZlFzYm7erMeYflLzeutOh4FRBTFaxsNV1oT-HFJO0l6oYXe9jGX_16QzgC-jciowRunP2bZvsbwU6YvXRKsyh7kvenqlJ2ka_5W45qcxOGHg9swL_9NP3JVsxSzA/w400-h180/20240505_133333.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Entering France from Bielsa in Aragon in the Spanish Pyrenees</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Then began my adventure. What a scary road I had to drive on; thousands of sharp bends, some seeming impossible to drive around and often no traffic barriers. I read later the crossing has an elevation of 1820m above sea level. No wonder it's so scary. I imagine in the winter it must be often closed because of the snow. Dealing with rain was difficult enough, I can tell you.</div><div><br></br></div><div>After leaving the tunnel it was all downhill and even more scary. I drove as carefully as I could and quite slowly at times, at an average speed of 40km. I wasn't scared so much as tense and kept saying to myself; "you can do it, you can do it" and I did.

Well, I am but without the van. However, I was a girl guide and ranger so camping comes naturally to me. I love the outdoors. I also love fine dining at fancy restaurants but am completely at home making a picnic in the countryside on a road trip. Others said I looked happy and relaxed. I did. It was a happy moment.</div><div><br></br></div><div>But we couldn't stop for long as we still had quite a way to go: 238km or 2h 28 min. We drove towards Toulouse and then on the A61 autoroute that leads to Barcelona.  Once on the motorway, it was a fast drive. Even so, we only got to Carcassonne at about 6.30 pm. We soon found our apartment in the Bastide San Louis, just 1.8km to the medieval part of the city. We also found a free parking space right round the corner.

The city became famous for its role in the Albigensian Crusades when the city was a stronghold of the Occitan Cathars - considered rivals and heretics to the Papal rule. In 1209, the Pope's army, under Arnaud Amalric forced the Cathars to surrender, killing them all. The French Inquisition's main target were the Cathars and oh my God, how they delighted in torturing them in the cruelest manner imaginable to man. We would witness this at the Inquisition Museum. <div><br></br></div><div>The history of Carcassonne could fill many volume of books. It was conquered by the Visigoths, the Romans and even the Moors and at one stage belonged to Aragon (now part of Spain.  More recently in WW2, the French resistance there were murdered by the Nazis as they left France. But it is the legend of the Dame Carcas that I loved best; a Moorish, Sarecen fairy princess who ruled the knights of the city after her husband was killed. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8JcqzBoCI-HGBzEfzMTo4V-7TFPqboNFU86Gxmo92Gs1H8ohk68H7ox48r9LvVGnpf9QTCgroF8WJt5Jlz9wWdTPWl1CeKXLTE8qWRHXT37LburouWtPL4i1XCJ20VohZ9EzEUeUfLvYK0xVVucvZ0uoxj23Oe_aYgzHMFE3G7r2AO_FHl-Veug/s2048/France_cite_carcassonne_dame_carcas.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8JcqzBoCI-HGBzEfzMTo4V-7TFPqboNFU86Gxmo92Gs1H8ohk68H7ox48r9LvVGnpf9QTCgroF8WJt5Jlz9wWdTPWl1CeKXLTE8qWRHXT37LburouWtPL4i1XCJ20VohZ9EzEUeUfLvYK0xVVucvZ0uoxj23Oe_aYgzHMFE3G7r2AO_FHl-Veug/w400-h300/France_cite_carcassonne_dame_carcas.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Dame Carcas, the symbol of Carcassonne</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>When the city was besieged by Charlemagne's army in the 8th century, this lady fed a pig, stuffed it with wheat and threw it over the city walls.

I had only heard of the Spanish Inquisition which happened later than its French counterpart. In the 12th century, under Pope Innocent III, who was anything but innocent, the Inquisition was aimed at combating religious heresy, particularly among the Cathars,as well as the Waldensians. This nasty Pope also worked tirelessly in the Crusades to recover the Holy Land, but he will remain known for the cruelty with which the Inquisition combated heresy, especially in Italy and southern France. </div><div><br></br></div><div>The instruments we saw as well as the models of heretics being tortured or burned at the stake, were absolutely sickening, even more so than what I saw many years ago in the Tower of London. Many of these instruments came from Spain, such as the garrote vil.

This is quite the Tour of Italy, which, by the way,  coincides with the Giro d'Italia that began, like us, on 4th May. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We left Carcassonne on <b>Tuesday</b> at around 9.45, very early for us. Our journey was only 300km that day and as it was all on the good French Autoroutes, we were in Aix quite soon. I chose Aix-en-Provence on route to La Spezia (Cinque Terre) as the alternatives were Marseilles (too big) or the Côte D'Azure again which I know quite well. We weren't so happy with our choice of accommodation just 2km outside the old city. The building was ugly and jaded and there was no lift to our 2nd floor tiny apartment. On the plus side, the apartment was bright, clean and well equipped and had both a washing machine (important) and a small terrace overlooking a pleasant garden.</div><div><br></br></div><div>At around 4 pm, we drove into town and parked near the famous fountain called La Rotonde on a huge square of the same name.

On the way we stopped at Monoprix to get some good French provisions at their food store which I love.

We were out by 9.30 and thought we had a 5 or 6 hour journey maximum to La Spezia (Cinque Terre territory). But oh my the traffic on the cross frontier motorway, the A10 from the French Riviera all the way to Genova was horrendous. There were times the traffic jams were over 1.5h. It took us 12 hours to reach our <a href="https://www.agriturismogolfodeipoeti.com/suites.html">Agroturismo</a> near Spezia.   l learned the word for traffic jam in both French and Italian: "bouchon" and "coda"- there you go. I only found out why there was so much traffic days later. We should have arrived at around 3 pm but didn't get there till nearly 10 at night.  We took turns driving, or rather sitting at the wheel, and the only highlight was  a stop at the last "Aire" in France before entering Italy.

I rustled up a quick dinner we had on the amazing terrace - the absolute highlight of the accommodation with views of the Bay of La Spezia - called The Bay of Poets (Golfo dei poeti). The place is just 4km from the centre and the views are great but the road is dreadful.</div><div><br></br></div><div>I, at least, slept like a log that night and woke up at 6 am on <b>Thursday</b> morning.

Really it makes up five villages Monterroso, Vernazza, Corniglia, Manarola and Riomaggiore  - a string of beautiful old fishing villages perched on the mountains high above the Italian Riviera. Cinque Terre has to be in the top 20 of the most visited places in Italy. That's what it seemed to me as we struggled to get there and see them properly as all the world and his mother had decided to go the same day we did. I would find out later why it was so crowded. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Impossible to go by car, we took the Cinque Terre Express train from La Spezia station. The other option is by boat but my husband is not a good sailor. We thought we could just buy the tickets at the station, but the queues were ginormous. In the end I got them online at the station. The distances are very short and you can get on and off the train and visit whichever village takes your fancy in any order. We hadn't done our homework so just got off at the first station, Riomaggiore. It turned out to be our favourite.  Later I read it is the most scenic with its lovely harbour and atmosphere. Here are some photos.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhPQB6o_CQhZfJiBWfXrW9fnRLcSRF6JunIa4WqwXwv4RrYlRdPtJkfQeVamHsC4PGtonLYElZA3rt-7RxiJxZAqVDfAcQAai-NAhWdb48aqUt3M6u5KY84dzfIjo-oBrroAXT6LZYH3xYcqmoFP37zifmqeFM3ZWqrXBFkxy5Rq60-FBw7V3f7Qg/s4032/20240509_113331.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhPQB6o_CQhZfJiBWfXrW9fnRLcSRF6JunIa4WqwXwv4RrYlRdPtJkfQeVamHsC4PGtonLYElZA3rt-7RxiJxZAqVDfAcQAai-NAhWdb48aqUt3M6u5KY84dzfIjo-oBrroAXT6LZYH3xYcqmoFP37zifmqeFM3ZWqrXBFkxy5Rq60-FBw7V3f7Qg/w400-h180/20240509_113331.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_MwFhlFq-24I7vPN_ySFx_3LJcMdfoYLbJUWv2FHKRWKfXY6963gmAphOPYaxjNKLoSNFpNx0lbAjesG1vju8CNYEn9wGRY1NHABmud7sGXeC5ropqtDA3oQ5gNBv-lRxsFM9HP0Y4SQeZhnxdjZtrD4vD5TCQAYSOSHe4x65ipLWflCK_HkR2A/s4032/20240509_113912.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_MwFhlFq-24I7vPN_ySFx_3LJcMdfoYLbJUWv2FHKRWKfXY6963gmAphOPYaxjNKLoSNFpNx0lbAjesG1vju8CNYEn9wGRY1NHABmud7sGXeC5ropqtDA3oQ5gNBv-lRxsFM9HP0Y4SQeZhnxdjZtrD4vD5TCQAYSOSHe4x65ipLWflCK_HkR2A/w180-h400/20240509_113912.jpg" width="180"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHQalC6kHHVh4rol7LfP-jez_ORstHEoZ3wfMLFsgK_8ibeXNoUKWSwb5N09G2tDZnUbDJQv15U92JCgpNWMlUB6fX5kqx7yclKTExRVnVM1LHMhjGYjRn5fWAX7X70zyZ_tRr3ocWDp9Mm1FROdOYyS34J_vk_x5ZlK7E3fu9ydHvo3hE6wB5Cg/s4032/20240509_115738.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHQalC6kHHVh4rol7LfP-jez_ORstHEoZ3wfMLFsgK_8ibeXNoUKWSwb5N09G2tDZnUbDJQv15U92JCgpNWMlUB6fX5kqx7yclKTExRVnVM1LHMhjGYjRn5fWAX7X70zyZ_tRr3ocWDp9Mm1FROdOYyS34J_vk_x5ZlK7E3fu9ydHvo3hE6wB5Cg/w180-h400/20240509_115738.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Riomaggiore, our favourite of the 5 "lands" in Cinque Terre</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We skipped Corniglia, the most remote, which has over 400 steps to get to from the station and got off at Vernazza.  A mature couple form Boston US, told us it was their favourite.

I mean, when in Italy ordering pasta or pizza is a must, isn't it? We loved it and drowned it down with a generous glass of Prosecco. We got talking to a young couple sitting very near us. They were Greek and  both of them had both studied Philosophy, the boy at St. Andrews and the girl at York. It was such a coincidence as Eladio was a teacher of philosophy. I told them he doesn't know modern Greek but can recite Ancient Greek and of course knows Latin and Hebrew - ancient too. I spurred him on to recite something in Ancient Greek for them to hear and they were amazed. Me too, at his memory. For the record it was an extract from the Anabasis by Jenofonte. I was so proud of him. We had such an interesting conversation.  But it was time to go; we had just paid and they were being served.<div><br></br></div><div>Our next village on the list was Monterosso - the largest with its beaches (grey I have to say), shops and restaurants but also beautiful Ligurian houses with their trademark dark green shutters. On the train there we got talking to another person, this time a Romanian. Gheorghe is a tour guide but had been in the Romanian army for many years. He seemed to know a lot about Spanish military history and even knew the name of El Cid's sword as well as his full name. I don't think all Spaniards know he was known as Rodrigo Dìaz de Vivar. He was such a charming man and a pleasure to meet. While exchanging cards, he gave Eladio his tour flag to hold and I had to have a photo.

I didn't get why there are so many people in Cinque Terre at the beginning of May from all corners of the world. I had imagined lots of retired people like us, but there were people of all ages. Don't they work I wondered? I love Italy but don't like crowds.  On the other hand I want to see the pretty places too, so that's the price to pay, sometimes. I later  heard from a former colleague, Kaisu and my cousin Marie that the beginning of our road trip had coincided with a very long bank holiday in many parts of Europe because of  Armistice Day and the Ascension. Neither are celebrated in Spain; just May Day. If only we had known, we would have left later. <div><br></br><div><div>But we did have some quiet time at the end of the day before heading back to La Spezia and then to our Agriturismo. We had a drink at a simple little bar near the harbour and I had an Aperol Spritz, all the rage in the UK, unheard of in Spain but apparently comes from Italy. I say, while in Italy, do as the Italians. It was delicious.

It was less crowded than I expected too so made for a wonderful day trip.   It's an hour by train to Santa Margherita Ligure - a beautiful town in itself on the Ligurian coast. Then we took a bus to Portofino which is actually quite small. So what is so special about this famous port? Well, it's been made popular by the famous and rich but it also combines Mediterranean nature with one of the most picturesque landscapes on the Italian coast. Stunningly picturesque is how I would describe it .  Here is just one photo I took from the top of the Castello Brown for anyone reading this who hasn't been. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5Z0L8SwBbTgrMq-SpfIYunlBjG2_j3RDsO_XRaxGkpv70KIJgeh1aKhhWafUBSmdJq89w5LgVvw6mLmPOSlHzISAdbuTFx0sY2Qu_XsDfAkb6Rz4zYM_AXAy0sZODBYa5vWRN-po6OL7pnzkZ3I7iQvcw1Tw0le0iYbNhUI4pChRiEs18s_UAwQ/s4032/20240510_142809.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5Z0L8SwBbTgrMq-SpfIYunlBjG2_j3RDsO_XRaxGkpv70KIJgeh1aKhhWafUBSmdJq89w5LgVvw6mLmPOSlHzISAdbuTFx0sY2Qu_XsDfAkb6Rz4zYM_AXAy0sZODBYa5vWRN-po6OL7pnzkZ3I7iQvcw1Tw0le0iYbNhUI4pChRiEs18s_UAwQ/w400-h180/20240510_142809.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Beautiful Portofino as seen from the Castello Brown high above the town</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>Everyone heads to the main square of Portofino, right in front of the port.

Apparently it was the name of the English consul in Genoa, Montague Yeats Brown, who owned it from 1867 to 1905, probably long before the town became famous.

But we got lost and the Satnav played tricks on us. When we finally found it,  we were very impressed with the variety of products and quality. Oh how civilised this country is I have to say and how friendly are its countrymen. I just love Italy. We got lots of fruit and veg, milk, eggs, some meat, fish and I couldn't resist the local focaccia. It was a bit easier coming "home". We were exhausted and have both commented just what hard work tourism is, hahahahah.

And I'm really glad I did as it is stunning.</div><div><br></br></div><div>We left our agritursimo at just before 9 am and got to Lucca by 10 am. That gave us plenty of time to see the main sights before continuting to San Gimignano. Lucca is knows as the city of 100 towers and a 100 churches; all within the medieval walls surrounded by fresh grass.

But what intrigued me most was to learn who the relic of the body buried just below the altar belonged to. No other than an Armenian pilgrim, Saint Davino. He left his homeland on a pilgrimage to Santiago in Spain which took him through Jerusalem and Rome. But he was attacked many times, especially on his head and lived on with pain. He became the patron saint of headaches! He died in Lucca near this church where he is now buried. San Davino  has gone down in history as a very famous pilgrim. Wow! What a story.<div><div><br></br></div><div>No doubt Giacomo Puccini, the famous opera composer who was born in Lucca, knew the story of San Davino very well. We were lucky enough to see the house where he was born and which is now a museum. We also had our photo taken next to his statue by two kind ladies from Valencia. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiv0ZqgrpVvVrqf1dP4PXiM7uILfSnSGm5iLtY_BFd-eWbhbfEYGj7KyF6KLq9jEG4FenF2CDwCcPxev_Z_WsbpEQpQHzPEJjY0eVcEiYblNGsSu2JZMzJIC2988lq9KkllVtvzMIjo6roWas5M0nYrG8GX0AVIXD8JXFL3qcZfG1Mmmtqc6q32pg/s4032/20240511_115903.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiv0ZqgrpVvVrqf1dP4PXiM7uILfSnSGm5iLtY_BFd-eWbhbfEYGj7KyF6KLq9jEG4FenF2CDwCcPxev_Z_WsbpEQpQHzPEJjY0eVcEiYblNGsSu2JZMzJIC2988lq9KkllVtvzMIjo6roWas5M0nYrG8GX0AVIXD8JXFL3qcZfG1Mmmtqc6q32pg/w400-h180/20240511_115903.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>By Puccini's statue in Lucca where he was born</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkYOjRV_rRjWBxrgw-hToX8um6zipcAJa5oqM8iD77rm7XGu8OFfkghnnrCpaVOhiXSPQPF-cp3I-nMPtIXa7TvB4jsz1QsKDOIlYs2XLp-xnfWrLXB6JOg0tMhQ0-t3VFoacqylygq_w159oITBejF9LeH0uALo0bWw3nxcRdTLAJSR3XqveO-g/s2708/20240511_120025.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkYOjRV_rRjWBxrgw-hToX8um6zipcAJa5oqM8iD77rm7XGu8OFfkghnnrCpaVOhiXSPQPF-cp3I-nMPtIXa7TvB4jsz1QsKDOIlYs2XLp-xnfWrLXB6JOg0tMhQ0-t3VFoacqylygq_w159oITBejF9LeH0uALo0bWw3nxcRdTLAJSR3XqveO-g/s320/20240511_120025.jpg" width="209"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Puccini's house</i></td></tr></tbody></table>That is where our short tour of the city ended. We are not intense type tourists who have to see every sight and go into every museum. We prefer to visit those sights that most interest us, of course. But, above all, we like to meet people, try out the local language (loving practicing Italian which I studied 40 years ago) and take in the history and culture as well as the gastronomy and the countryside  when it is as picturesque as in Tuscany or as breathtaking as in the Pyrenees.  We always refer to ourselves as "country mice". We wouldn't want to live in a city but like visiting them if they are of cultural or historic interest.  <br></br><div><br></br></div><div>After a quick stop in that beautiful city, we walked up the main street, Via Fillungo which I loved, until we found our car. From there it was only 76km to San Gimignano but as it was across the countryside and on rural roads, it would take 1.5h approximately. We didn't mind as it was delightful to drive through the Tuscan countryside, full of vineyards I should add. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We arrived safe and sound in the old city of San Gimignano at around 2 pm and were able to park in the Santo Agostino square, right in front of the apartment we had booked called after the square.

But we are tourists aren't we?</div><div><div><br></br></div><div>We soon settled in, had  lunch and rested for a while. I had done some homework about this unique medieval town famous for its incredibly high towers of which there are now only 14 left. Surrounded by vineyards, this walled city, 56km, south of Florence, was once an important stopping place for pilgrims traveling on the Via Francigena. It is obviously a World Heritage sight and is one of the most iconic destinations in Tuscany. </div><div><br></br></div><div>That was all very well and I was dying to see the town, but while resting in our apartment, a friend - Gerard - told me that San Gimignano boasts the best ice cream in the world and that we had to have a gelato at Gelateria Dondoli. The Master Gelato Maker, Sergio Dondoli, has won many prizes for his ice cream which claims to be the best in the world. This might be an exaggeration, but I am an ice cream lover, so that is where we headed first. It is just 450m from our apartment and is located in the beautiful Piazza della Cisterna, right next to the Piazza del Duomo, both in the heart of the town. I was lucky the queue wasn't too long and soon came out with a cone of this delicious ice  cream. I chose two flavours, amarena (typical Italian cherry) and coconut (yes, I'm a coconut freak too). Wow it was great.
