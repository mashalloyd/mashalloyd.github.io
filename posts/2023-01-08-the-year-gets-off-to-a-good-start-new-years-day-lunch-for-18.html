How are you all feeling now that the party is over; i.e. Christmas. I always find the rest of January difficult, a little uphill. After about 2 weeks of partying and, I should add, eating too much, going back to normal is a bit of a challenge. But I shall rise to it. My first New Year resolution is to go back on my diet which I shall resume tomorrow. It's back to my morning "gruel" type porridge; no more crumpets, roscón or croissants I'm afraid.<div><br></br></div><div>But this time last Sunday we were still celebrating. It was the first day of this new year and it got off to a good start. We had invited Eladio's brother and his family to lunch. Thus we would be 18 around the table. We had to set up two tables, one for 6 children and one for 12 adults. This is what  our dining room looked like. I was pleased with the result.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjkHiknlXSWraysDeW4txq1dJdAkzqT2pxbGfvM4n4aRdn4o4sNIFqb3ZHgqPF_2SgnKE8zw1fylrQZADr_aJpNi6-0AhJUvHZeCyBszPG2sneUbYwPGMyGSzay3WdCGrl5LZBBi7q9HYqh3IXTHaeSQCITaZDLv4Zi2LQiflmg1o4eMT3eBB0/s4032/20230101_132128.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjkHiknlXSWraysDeW4txq1dJdAkzqT2pxbGfvM4n4aRdn4o4sNIFqb3ZHgqPF_2SgnKE8zw1fylrQZADr_aJpNi6-0AhJUvHZeCyBszPG2sneUbYwPGMyGSzay3WdCGrl5LZBBi7q9HYqh3IXTHaeSQCITaZDLv4Zi2LQiflmg1o4eMT3eBB0/w400-h180/20230101_132128.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Lunch for 18 last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Before making the food, Eladio and I managed a brisk morning walk with Pippa. You can't imagine how lovely and sunny it was with the temperature well over 15ºc. Our guests arrived punctually and it was great to be together again, like the old days when the children were small. I had prepared a buffet lunch and realised when we were sitting down that the three generations had sat in order. Not so long ago I mused there were four generations until my father and Eladio's mother passed away in November 2020 and February 2021. How the family has grown though. That day the ages ranged from 70 odd to just 1 and we were all in peace and harmony and relaxed in each other's company. Eladio's family shuns having their photos on social media but not us me I got Miguel to take a photo of the four of us by the 2023 photo call. I would have loved to have Elliot and Juliet in the photo but they were being too high spirited hahaha. <div><br></br></div><div>The day was the perfect start to what I hope will be a good year. As a PS to New Year's Day, I was very touched when that night both girls, Suzy and Oli, wrote to me to thank me for organising a wonderful Christmas. Suzy went as far as to say that it was my spirit of Christmas that made it so special. Thank you girls. I did it for you and all the family and I loved every minute of it. </div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Monday</b> was 2nd January and our Christmas was not yet over as I (or is it we?) had to prepare for Kings' Day this last Friday the 6th Jan. In Spain, the 3 Kings are more important than Father Christmas. In our house it is the other way round but I do respect Kings' Day and we all get some token presents and have a special breakfast and lunch. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Overall though Monday was quiet. The highlight was my weekly Skype call with Amanda. She is the first person I have told, I think, of our travel plans this year. We have finally decided that our trip across Europe and as far as Georgia and maybe Armenia, will happen this spring. Both of us want to do it, slowly, enjoying places on the way and by car so that we stop or change routes at any moment. Thus you have me looking at maps and thinking ahead, applying for an international driving licence and other necessary documents. One of the places I definitely have to visit is Sofia where my mother and her family lived when they fled the revolution. I don't have much data to go on but will start with her older sister, Olga's convent. Through them I hope also to find my grandfather's church, his grave and their home. That will be very special. We have something big to plan for this year and planning as you know is part of the journey so we shall be busy on preparations for a while. Exciting times. We aim to go in May and or June, not sure yet when. </div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Tuesday</b> was another sunny day but I was up far too early at 6 am. After breakfast and reading the headlines I started on preliminary preparations for our exciting trip. After a few stops and starts I managed to order an international driving licence which we shall need for Georgia, .Armenia and who knows Azerbajan or Uzbekistan and some non EU Balkan countries. We shall also need a Green card, insurance, visas, etc. I then set about creating or trying to create a route map. For once I wished I had a paper map of Europe and Asia. Maybe I will get one. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We had no plans or engagements that day for once so it was ours for the taking. Suzy wanted to invite us out for coffee. So instead of going on our usual walk, we went on foot to Manolo Bakes via Mercadona and then home which totalled over 13000 steps on my lovely Samsung smart watch. No doubt though, all the calories burned walking were consumed by the capuccino and two small croissants. Suzy was looking lovely so I had to have a photo to show you just how beautiful she is.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEEfGNAog3DNMQZgoy-ySH9Sf4WH4fW7xpOnW3MPBohIjt_bAceE3-ddq5173GQeQBDWZl01My4u4IjRQonVI90axeMdMYE_TrDl1uq6XKwz42roccJWEu0ze9PZPyzBOyw_AC6lz38I57s6wcGMLzaOMUoYMcF_w-P88JlvlHpYfDGlikkbc/s2999/20230103_123633.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEEfGNAog3DNMQZgoy-ySH9Sf4WH4fW7xpOnW3MPBohIjt_bAceE3-ddq5173GQeQBDWZl01My4u4IjRQonVI90axeMdMYE_TrDl1uq6XKwz42roccJWEu0ze9PZPyzBOyw_AC6lz38I57s6wcGMLzaOMUoYMcF_w-P88JlvlHpYfDGlikkbc/w242-h400/20230103_123633.jpg" width="242"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Suzy at Manolo Bakes on Tuesday morning</i></td></tr></tbody></table>During our long walk with Pippa and at the café we spoke excitedly (the excitedly refers to us both  for once) about the trip. We later looked at the world map we have in the kitchen and showed Lucy our route. We still haven't decided how long our trip will take but it won't be under a month, that is for sure.<div><br></br></div><div>Lunch was bits and bobs with so many leftovers after our New Year's celebration meals. I slept a whole 1.5h which I desperately needed and spent the rest of the afternoon watching part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_England_(TV_series)">This England</a> which I had started a while back. It covers pretty well how the UK handled or mishandled the Covid crisis. The UK may be past Covid but right now it is mired in financial woes with so many strikes taking place which is now set to include schools too.  Speaking to my friend Amanda she told me how her husband had fallen recently and possibly broken his ribs but was feeling better. I asked if he went to A&E and she laughed out loud saying that was not possible. That really brought the crisis of the NHS home to me. <br></br><div><br></br></div><div><b>Wednesday</b> dawned and I was up again at 6 am but had slept reasonably well. I spent more time on our route map there and back. On the way back I want to include part of Greece, Albania and Montenegro - let's see what happens when we actually hit the road. There is so much to see and it's all so exciting.</div><div><br></br></div><div>We had a few errands to do that morning. I love spending our  mornings doing them together. First we had coffee at Alverán where we ordered our Kings' Day roscón. From there we drove to the local private clinic to pick up a couple of prescriptions and then to the chemist. The next stop was a Chinese store - similar to poundland type places - to get a few bulbs. They may sell a lot of rubbish but they also sell a lot of things difficult to find elsewhere. Our last stop was at BM, a very upmarket supermarket, to get meat for our Kings' Day roast beef and Yorkshire pudding - very British right? I indulged in more turrón and chocolates I am afraid. Eladio indulged in, guess what? Ready to eat roast rabbit leg which I cannot stomach.</div><div><br></br></div><div>We shouldn't have had a heavy lunch as that night we had a dinner engagement in the city hosted by our dear friend Julio. In a way I'm glad the festivities are over so that I can return to my diet and improve my figure (hahahaha). Dinner was to be at a very swish and swanky place called La Primera. It is in the Grassy building (horrible name) which is a superb construction on the Gran Via - one of Madrid's most famous thoroughfares. I thought the style was art'deco but no, it is eclecticism. It's still beautiful. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3Bo3rVLZkXa6IezU0lCrNPjNVpFU0W8aCaZFDJMuzz6a7mpU_IwXuTFo8SAnPWFCAsfLz4XenOWarmkbEOcxDR19CCUuY3lxHwdexE7K6CAkZtHgQJklTCWUs3fN3WORBqrzneLZLVuidO7BJWeAALQWF2beCwVEZeWZJxIORzubrlLyXtIA/s1600/Grassy.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi3Bo3rVLZkXa6IezU0lCrNPjNVpFU0W8aCaZFDJMuzz6a7mpU_IwXuTFo8SAnPWFCAsfLz4XenOWarmkbEOcxDR19CCUuY3lxHwdexE7K6CAkZtHgQJklTCWUs3fN3WORBqrzneLZLVuidO7BJWeAALQWF2beCwVEZeWZJxIORzubrlLyXtIA/w400-h300/Grassy.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Edificio Grassy - Number 1 Gran Via where the restaurant La Primera is located</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br>Even more spectacular is the Metropolis building bang next door. It is one of the city's many landmarks. I am familiar with it as I had my very first job interview ever there. It was with Señor Chicharro who found me a job as an English language assistant in Moratalaz (outside the city) back in 1978. I shall never forget the interview. I went back a few years later after graduating and the same Señor Chicharro found me a proper job as an English teacher at a Teacher Training college in the city in C/Islas Filipinas. I think he had quite a high up position in the Ministry of Education. Looking back, I also think he must have taken a fancy to me. This is the iconic building with the same architectural style as Edificio Grassy.</div><div><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0Er6ixQVQX2KRA_cFSfGXNhqmXQncwOk3dR5oWiQ2lHkTt09GcGiaP8dY8yp9JSbZScIH5ZptQ6jrJjAOixJ1B6xxvbOZMlHo1K1X78-GGn2SP6j43XeV4QpjA6-7NZBszcTenePSYSbDgOQcROeyrQuYzkjBmBeGTus0tWalKSH8fHkfe-Y/s799/800px-Edificio_Metr%C3%B3polis,_calle_de_Alcal%C3%A1,_Madrid,_Espa%C3%B1a,_2017-05-18,_DD_08.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="272" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0Er6ixQVQX2KRA_cFSfGXNhqmXQncwOk3dR5oWiQ2lHkTt09GcGiaP8dY8yp9JSbZScIH5ZptQ6jrJjAOixJ1B6xxvbOZMlHo1K1X78-GGn2SP6j43XeV4QpjA6-7NZBszcTenePSYSbDgOQcROeyrQuYzkjBmBeGTus0tWalKSH8fHkfe-Y/w400-h272/800px-Edificio_Metr%C3%B3polis,_calle_de_Alcal%C3%A1,_Madrid,_Espa%C3%B1a,_2017-05-18,_DD_08.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Metropolis building on Calle Alcalá where I had my first ever job interview in Spain. </i></td></tr></tbody></table>When we walked out of the car park nearby to walk to La Primera, the Metropolis building was covered up - apparently it will be turned into a 5 star hotel. It was dark and we were able to see some pretty spectacular Christmas lighting. We had to have some photos of course. <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBEWIL2UzMXvMo0ME9xi7FHGi5z23z2qFeJCuv-HHJGCr-i3jjUfw3umAWA0TIfwcf-J0P0vgUXVN6LepGxgA7_cEUER-i9jQ45xGTqeeIh2PQPZ2XtGfvVDmdUx7CVqdFkAkQKX_Ih1RBUitV02Rp7uv-3SM1l6QkApfRBQ41HopJI9wkrEY/s4032/20230104_203337.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhBEWIL2UzMXvMo0ME9xi7FHGi5z23z2qFeJCuv-HHJGCr-i3jjUfw3umAWA0TIfwcf-J0P0vgUXVN6LepGxgA7_cEUER-i9jQ45xGTqeeIh2PQPZ2XtGfvVDmdUx7CVqdFkAkQKX_Ih1RBUitV02Rp7uv-3SM1l6QkApfRBQ41HopJI9wkrEY/w400-h180/20230104_203337.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhf8JkhAYCxMr_2K_tgfhvBRJhyEz2R2PjhSejep7QT_KEp2LeVaRxF9xgzLo-Dw-6q69RKLNnSxRNXTFACov17Dm9jQ5VMGcptsVpQ8WPXKfsbRL52yKxW6ooDJFXETj9DHMTaqQO-wNnN3Q_ZumbVsyJVrtiIUeGjfMU4DYi4vu3ZdgA3seE/s4032/20230104_203429.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhf8JkhAYCxMr_2K_tgfhvBRJhyEz2R2PjhSejep7QT_KEp2LeVaRxF9xgzLo-Dw-6q69RKLNnSxRNXTFACov17Dm9jQ5VMGcptsVpQ8WPXKfsbRL52yKxW6ooDJFXETj9DHMTaqQO-wNnN3Q_ZumbVsyJVrtiIUeGjfMU4DYi4vu3ZdgA3seE/w400-h180/20230104_203429.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfA5XZoYjG3T9gl0-1DgLDsThD7u8H_RUdTgotW6-8RhRIAejU5vk5uDGkFC2mIZPTDJNK4G2hsidV1sub0qqD9ehNiKIv6sqUWc3vQeOX3JEkqOUcjdGKw5DFpCc_y9iSadD2wdcpvkqbCp2VjarEBHE47wiIoFcqCD58vGQH8WKvLwHMnNg/s4032/20230104_203441.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjfA5XZoYjG3T9gl0-1DgLDsThD7u8H_RUdTgotW6-8RhRIAejU5vk5uDGkFC2mIZPTDJNK4G2hsidV1sub0qqD9ehNiKIv6sqUWc3vQeOX3JEkqOUcjdGKw5DFpCc_y9iSadD2wdcpvkqbCp2VjarEBHE47wiIoFcqCD58vGQH8WKvLwHMnNg/w180-h400/20230104_203441.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Photos in Madrid on Wednesday night</i></td></tr></tbody></table>For the record I was wearing a semi festive black and white woolen dress which was a present from last year, a dress I had completely forgotten about. I had also dug out a black velvet cape like coat by Zara which I had forgotten about too. It should have been cold out but it wasn't. The temperature at around  8.30 pm was 13ºc! <div><br></br></div><div>It was a short walk from the car park near Metro Sevilla to the restaurant. We arrived before Julio and were escorted up a fancy staircase into the main dining rooms with most of the tables overlooking the Gran Via. It is a very smart place. I could hear both English and Spanish spoken all around me. <a href="https://restaurantelaprimera.com/">La Primera</a> seems a popular place with a lot going for it - both the food and decor are superb. Julio persuaded us to try the tortilla which was divine but I preferred the artichokes. At the end of our dinner we exchanged presents, as we do every year.  I also took along crackers causing a bit of a stir hahahahaha.

We all remarked that this was possibly due to the fact that we are now rid of Covid. Where Covid is causing havoc now is in China where it all began. So why is that when the government had a zero Covid policy? There are lots of answers why China is now experiencing the worst of the pandemic when ours is over. The main one is down to their not very effective vaccine. Countries around the world are now asking for people arriving from China to have a Covid test or proof of vaccine. That makes sense I suppose. What doesn't make sense is that they will be allowed through even if they have the virus and only be told to wear a mask. <div><br></br></div><div>We walked out of the restaurant onto the Gran Via which looked splendid with the Christmas lights. Our last photo was a selfie next to a great big festive ball where everyone else was doing the same. Here we are together, the 3 musketeers. It used to be Julio, Fátima and I and now it is Julio, Eladio and I. RIP dear Fátima.

Our guest Ximena and her son had arrived in our absence but they must have been asleep by then. They left yesterday morning for a new life as my guests had found a flat to rent in nearby Boadilla. <div><br></br></div><div>I slept quite well and got up at 7.30 on <b>Thursday</b> morning 5th January, known in Spain as "Noche de Reyes" (Kings' Night).  There was plenty of time to read the headlines.</div><div><br></br></div><div><div>The main news that day  was the burial of Pope Benedict VI. Pope Francis who is now 85, the age Ratzinger resigned, led the outdoor funeral which was supposed to be simple but didn't seem so to me. What was quite remarkable for me was that one Pope was burying another. I wonder too if Pope Francis who appeared in a wheel chair not looking in great health, may be harbouring thoughts of resigning too. Honestly, why are Cardinals who are too old for the job elected Pope? </div><div><br></br></div><div>The other big news of the day was the accidental release in Spain of Prince Harry's book, "Spare", supposed to be published on 10th January. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4kcuj4r1Iq-Ik3SN9pIgX47CeRXJ2InippfRBYUYWRPRS0zUgnMlDENVctYFNowqGa155BHS9eAYpA3rakUozbGJSMHS_23sS7ipRXljiREz362nXZasOZEW5ZnMSEbbmjuoL0FCnrtwKiSUI9roRPmUdOvZ1KVQTJ0Blz9OP4X3uyCP1Jds/s1920/VAOO7PKRRFKYNI3PSJQ4IBBVH4.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="314" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4kcuj4r1Iq-Ik3SN9pIgX47CeRXJ2InippfRBYUYWRPRS0zUgnMlDENVctYFNowqGa155BHS9eAYpA3rakUozbGJSMHS_23sS7ipRXljiREz362nXZasOZEW5ZnMSEbbmjuoL0FCnrtwKiSUI9roRPmUdOvZ1KVQTJ0Blz9OP4X3uyCP1Jds/w400-h314/VAOO7PKRRFKYNI3PSJQ4IBBVH4.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Prince Harry's all tell book due to be released on 10th January was accidentally put on sale by some booksellers in Spain on 5th January</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div><br></br></div><div>The UK tabloids got hold of it and it was fodder for all the front pages. They have given the game away now.  If you have been following the news you will know Harry accuses William of committing violence, knocking him to the floor during an argument about Meghan. We have learned too that their father begged them not to make his final years a misery. Well, it seems they will because of Harry's book "Spare". The title refers to Harry being the spare rather than the heir and possibly how difficult that is for him. In Spanish that doesn't translate well - the equivalent would be the heir and the successor so I suppose the translator will have had a hard job trying to come up with a decent equivalent. "Sombra" means both is "in the shade" or "in the shadow"  in Spanish.  I would not want to read it in Spanish  and I have pre-ordered  the English version but presume I am not going to learn much more as the main stories have already been published. No doubt Penguin House is furious with the publishers in Spain who should not have sent the book out before 10th January. I bet Buckingham Palace and Prince William are going "spare" themselves with these revelations which are going to make any hope of reconciliation fade away. I bet too that their late mother, Princess Diana, would be appalled. </div></div><div><br></br></div><div>While all this was going on in the world, Kings' parades were being organised in every city Spain  and in most villages too. </div><div><br></br></div><div>The highlight for us as grandparents and Suzy as an aunt was joining Oli, Miguel, Ellio and Juliet at the Kings' procession in nearby Boadilla del Monte. The one in Madrid is far grander but too much trouble to go to. Even so, we had to walk to the beginning of the parade as cars were parked everywhere. For children in Spain, this is a pivotal moment of Christmas, seeing the 3 Kings, Melcior, Gaspar and Balthazar. They love Father Christmas but I think still prefer the Kings and everyone has their favourite.  That night brought back memories of us taking the girls to the parade when they were small and we hadn't been to one since. It was certainly larger and more spectacular. It started with the police,  firemen and then the Guardia Civil on horseback in their gala uniform. Then came all sorts of floats from  where dressed up pages, angels, etc throw sweets to delighted children. Here are some photos of that night, Elliot's first as a fan of the 3 Kings. Juliet, aged just one, bless her, was not quite as enthusiastic. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhn357EM7_7QMrjr9tDZOzn2g6aZQt3KMhLtjjfIWqU_-b9lBzD_kIKRt-ZGzXI5VGAp68pCIZx8nw73AQz5l96JodIAa9tqaepsZMM7KORtXiO-O3rQpijRMzYwD5LuHfOS2X0HmBJLwTCuNA1NHigN2ycgdQPgrDafGVUgZdDFuSuJYurVQ4/s4032/20230105_175702.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhn357EM7_7QMrjr9tDZOzn2g6aZQt3KMhLtjjfIWqU_-b9lBzD_kIKRt-ZGzXI5VGAp68pCIZx8nw73AQz5l96JodIAa9tqaepsZMM7KORtXiO-O3rQpijRMzYwD5LuHfOS2X0HmBJLwTCuNA1NHigN2ycgdQPgrDafGVUgZdDFuSuJYurVQ4/w400-h180/20230105_175702.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgHj4OAVbEhLb8qJiPouSPvMbdOGcE0eqA13TrGN3llmBDHHHM0MRdSS9qCHg_k8zjyQfNwVyrFfSpUi88B7kzzjqKAPmc52KBNoJAMxh_Rn4SQgCjIteU3ks-_NLS9iItUtRSHgJGmKr_hYHVrYMvXA3KQF60txH8bFgE-04CqDEcpb_YrP0/s4032/20230105_182340.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgHj4OAVbEhLb8qJiPouSPvMbdOGcE0eqA13TrGN3llmBDHHHM0MRdSS9qCHg_k8zjyQfNwVyrFfSpUi88B7kzzjqKAPmc52KBNoJAMxh_Rn4SQgCjIteU3ks-_NLS9iItUtRSHgJGmKr_hYHVrYMvXA3KQF60txH8bFgE-04CqDEcpb_YrP0/w180-h400/20230105_182340.jpg" width="180"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgbW_RAMf50sOMEcMBLoozZkdFaP7ovsCKEnDvML5NyWebsQ2fcvOrqXV3TM57ff__KkiWyMilYcnnKTWg1Oke1JsQaokkT-R7eKpJ0_b2vpVM9XJveOgUJ1f2JNfdTj4jqdC_o2JM1S9ybv5Xrr6h7GvNrZLUTQHVB0WpLSS3FyjijQfoddA4/s4032/20230105_185846.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgbW_RAMf50sOMEcMBLoozZkdFaP7ovsCKEnDvML5NyWebsQ2fcvOrqXV3TM57ff__KkiWyMilYcnnKTWg1Oke1JsQaokkT-R7eKpJ0_b2vpVM9XJveOgUJ1f2JNfdTj4jqdC_o2JM1S9ybv5Xrr6h7GvNrZLUTQHVB0WpLSS3FyjijQfoddA4/w180-h400/20230105_185846.jpg" width="180"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Spot the back of Eladio and Oli watching the parade</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKbxw9fRvFRL7hYOa3m0PgzPEml4KiMLchpx7uzfV6YAcsIln_dT4Ass8ToU8wEg5lcYiuK4Wkwf9JVGGMFNdgWA0ICyP3hHon5u0PAeGH6ArpxF9xkWKaAmSysrj-z0vxDKWBmbxGRL6EX1MR9W7s-X_FQnpMSkViqNQR2CqUnr45DdenezA/s4032/20230105_185853.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKbxw9fRvFRL7hYOa3m0PgzPEml4KiMLchpx7uzfV6YAcsIln_dT4Ass8ToU8wEg5lcYiuK4Wkwf9JVGGMFNdgWA0ICyP3hHon5u0PAeGH6ArpxF9xkWKaAmSysrj-z0vxDKWBmbxGRL6EX1MR9W7s-X_FQnpMSkViqNQR2CqUnr45DdenezA/w400-h180/20230105_185853.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Some photos of the Kings' parade on Thursday night</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>The crowds were big and to see anything I had to stand on a bench behind them but then I missed seeing the 3 Kings up close hahaha.

I shall never forget either that mine was second hand while his was new. I never said anything but it upset me - sibling rivalry for you.

Oli would follow with Juliet while Miguel left with Elliot to spend the day with his family. I had decided on a very British meal: roast beef and Yorkshire pudding with all the trimmings and had to peel the sprouts, the potatoes and make the Yorkshire batter. I did this alone as Lucy took the day off. When the girls arrived we had our own present opening time. Eladio, via Olivia, had got me some lovely pastel blue coloured headphones by a make called Doquaus. For me the great advantage is that they can be used with and without blue tooth. <table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhNNHJNlGQ10phtIoXqWdkH1rKMnCr9JjT_tcHZqtxxNBtA93bTlJBzZTcjAkvC5C2jes1AY4BFVGisQ_phGuWZIEjR8jSYFTmZzy7frBFH3U5bYKmL9cbh9RsEquefJEZguwALC2g4vKZp99kAWJnKzke3otQerZDyhZhGDZhHpoLVwCDOCAg/s705/Doqaus%20headphones.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhNNHJNlGQ10phtIoXqWdkH1rKMnCr9JjT_tcHZqtxxNBtA93bTlJBzZTcjAkvC5C2jes1AY4BFVGisQ_phGuWZIEjR8jSYFTmZzy7frBFH3U5bYKmL9cbh9RsEquefJEZguwALC2g4vKZp99kAWJnKzke3otQerZDyhZhGDZhHpoLVwCDOCAg/w323-h400/Doqaus%20headphones.jpg" width="323"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My new headphones</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Oli had got a pair for Suzy for Christmas and when I expressed interest, Eladio asked her to get them for me via Amazon (where else?). But Amazon surprised us that day as when I opened the cardboard box which Eladio hadn't opened, inside were two sets of headphones; both blue. This was clearly Amazon's mistake as Oli had only been charged for one set. In the end Suzy kept the extra set in blue and gave her father hers which are black. Meanwhile Juliet was asleep and only woke up when I was in the midst of making our roast for lunch. We had to giver her our present which was a Playmobil house with lots of dolls and furniture.

Here is this year's photo of Eladio task in hand.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjlSgth_n2uB8tuomZ7gwEFMWOYc78JbImo7gT12yg_1jEpLYYVw4RAZnicrWqB36Bqt7nJZ4J0iu6_RuULyniyJ7Lhd1wSuzJfLr1R5UmyUT2endSkF8vA-FhQqVIqJEYlIxmbZIztGsy4Mi9fPIP4uPEKpa6GDfqGqbbcFpdD016E4VshdAE/s4032/20230107_104153.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjlSgth_n2uB8tuomZ7gwEFMWOYc78JbImo7gT12yg_1jEpLYYVw4RAZnicrWqB36Bqt7nJZ4J0iu6_RuULyniyJ7Lhd1wSuzJfLr1R5UmyUT2endSkF8vA-FhQqVIqJEYlIxmbZIztGsy4Mi9fPIP4uPEKpa6GDfqGqbbcFpdD016E4VshdAE/w180-h400/20230107_104153.jpg" width="180"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio taking the tree down yesterday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>It's always a sad task and takes a lot less time than putting them up but we got on with the job. It didn't help my mood that the weather had turned for the worse. It was foggy and wet but we still went for our hour long walk with Pippa. I didn't have to worry about lunch yesterday as there was enough of the roast beef and Yorkshire pudding left over for another meal. <div><br></br></div><div>Oli and family arrived unexpectedly at around 6 pm. They were supposed to be coming at 8 to leave the children with us and go out to dinner - something they never do alone. Thus we had the joy of the company of little Elliot and little Juliet, a lot of which was spent watching out for my ornaments for fear of them being broken which happens frequently hahahahaha. <br></br><div><br></br></div><div>The biggest job was baby sitting when Oli and Miguel left but we managed. After all there were three of us and Suzy is great with kids. She really is. First we fed them their favourite food; "tortillla" - Spanish omelet.  Then they got ice cream and finally some turrón. I can already see that Juliet has inherited her great grandfather's sweet tooth - and mine hahahhaha.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Later we took them upstairs to our bedroom where they had a fine time jumping up and down on our 180cm bed. Our big screen TV with Netflix also helped to while the time away. Here are some photos to record the moment.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLPbT3ifYMReHReXQxXIB9cLp0hdvAO-OiYqFppgDXggnZVmwmxRQTMmrfalmovBXIllEnzpccWeT-OWv1VYYsejoUskQuZu4Bz6YHhxQpMGEw1xmFob-KenYlSbBuhq3Y_8_sVn8U8z9paxw6jSc90F41wiHQVRaHx2ARwcfX94lwS7uIMMc/s2683/20230107_210309.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLPbT3ifYMReHReXQxXIB9cLp0hdvAO-OiYqFppgDXggnZVmwmxRQTMmrfalmovBXIllEnzpccWeT-OWv1VYYsejoUskQuZu4Bz6YHhxQpMGEw1xmFob-KenYlSbBuhq3Y_8_sVn8U8z9paxw6jSc90F41wiHQVRaHx2ARwcfX94lwS7uIMMc/w271-h400/20230107_210309.jpg" width="271"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd3H2-qy7KrCx4C6VOg_yNXSGkJONaw6bAZEfiZsH75HTM2N8FULW9yoF9ypR_K4fJiCM-yHOpXOOegDhZjbEYJ0wR6JnUDMzeBsMol8wr7hmqfMKpEXwfNWEAJFZv_uK6DII3WLtwosx3lWwvyGiAE7LXAz0y3VNYzPLQ-Jsjyj2AIXB6P6g/s4032/20230107_215006.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgd3H2-qy7KrCx4C6VOg_yNXSGkJONaw6bAZEfiZsH75HTM2N8FULW9yoF9ypR_K4fJiCM-yHOpXOOegDhZjbEYJ0wR6JnUDMzeBsMol8wr7hmqfMKpEXwfNWEAJFZv_uK6DII3WLtwosx3lWwvyGiAE7LXAz0y3VNYzPLQ-Jsjyj2AIXB6P6g/w400-h180/20230107_215006.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Baby sitting last night</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div>Pippa was with us too and I showed my grandchildren how I brush her teeth in the hope they would also be inspired hahahahaha.

Quite exhausted, once they left, we fell into our bed - on our own - and relaxed watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7477068/">The Tobacconist </a> set in  Vienna before the Anschluss. I was most interested in the story of the tobacconist's young assistant who makes friends with Sigmund Freud who was Jewish of course. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Today I was up at just before 8 am - a record. It is another rainy day but the forecast is better for the rest of the week. I am expecting my first guests after Kings' Day, today and tomorrow; groups from Germany and from China. I had to ask  the latter if they were vaccinated. Turns out they had Covid a month ago. It shouldn't worry us though as we both have had 4 jabs.</div><div><br></br></div><div>And now my friends, I have come to the end of the tales of this week, the first of this new year which I hope treats us all well. I also hope it brings good health, peace, love and, if possible, prosperity.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Cheers now until next Sunday,</div><div>All the best Masha. </div><div><br></br><div><br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">c</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></br></div><br></br></div></div>
