Here on the Explanade in Alicante.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Good morning to you all from Gran Alacant in Santa Pola.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>What a wonderful week it has been here with my oldest friends Andy and Amanda. For those of you who don't know, I went to school with Amanda where we met at the age of 11. We have been the greatest of friends ever since. Andy was Amanda's boyfriend from the age of 15. He went to my father's school, Bradford Grammar and was very much my friend too. Amanda has visited me often over the years and was with us in Santa Pola over 25 years ago and both of them came to see us in Callosa de Ensarría during our Callosa years from the early 70's. To quote Andy "I came here as a boy and returned as a man". It's great that our friendship has lasted so long and long may that be.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>They got&nbsp; here&nbsp;<b>last Sunday</b>&nbsp;in the afternoon and we arrived a few hours later as we had to babysit for our grandchildren until around 5 pm. Our drive here was made in the fastest time ever, I think. We got here here at about 9.30 pm and after a sweet reunion we all had dinner together. It was a very long day for us all as the clocks had gone forward. Even so, we were up until late chatting and chatting. Eladio and I live in a sort of bubble at home with very few friends so this week has been heaven for me and such a break. Our virus&nbsp; disappeared and I had lots of fun..&nbsp;<br /><p>On <b>Monday</b> I was up at the crack of dawn and was pleasantly surprised to see we had got our view of the sea back from the terrace, albeit partially. When we first bought this apartment in 1999, the trees in the garden were low enough to see the sea but they grew so much over the years and one tree in particular hid the view completely. It was never trimmed and just grew and grew so I was happy to see it gone and we now have a partial view of the sea from the terrace. Over the years I had written to complain about the tree but nothing was done until it had sprawled so much it fell over last summer and had to be cut down. This was the view at dawn and a little later.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAUsjr6tcX8ExDP7ehJHAddUGs5QxSqOcBxv-zt1rJHezmCrOHCZQ5-obun_xQ2Ewaf-CSQkL-rJKxBtH5WwnfDBLf9i5-9lZgE4T2I7Z2kvZRFlAHH7zy_K0IRNbhVcclv1trTOt1bnKKfF_7gLkdhulyb3Yunrd4mudppbXuzycNT3vyCMPIig/s4032/20250331_072247.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1816" data-original-width="4032" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAUsjr6tcX8ExDP7ehJHAddUGs5QxSqOcBxv-zt1rJHezmCrOHCZQ5-obun_xQ2Ewaf-CSQkL-rJKxBtH5WwnfDBLf9i5-9lZgE4T2I7Z2kvZRFlAHH7zy_K0IRNbhVcclv1trTOt1bnKKfF_7gLkdhulyb3Yunrd4mudppbXuzycNT3vyCMPIig/w400-h180/20250331_072247.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhV4kfBw6k8gh8V2FoLqZAYMVY1hVhDj4ulYuYQQ50ZB7jki3aEcT2uBJJUIWoQYvD4M3E2VBgODLatbXN-3G9OJ1BUT23DCBhSrSP9Dqsw1_cZyESPSqVpwsduL6ghl6S5n4uuxHV-GzPIZ7_f6CRIZBGdhP-boFvQ0YCDiXKRv4I-JDMaIBsH-g/s4032/20250331_103820.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1816" data-original-width="4032" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhV4kfBw6k8gh8V2FoLqZAYMVY1hVhDj4ulYuYQQ50ZB7jki3aEcT2uBJJUIWoQYvD4M3E2VBgODLatbXN-3G9OJ1BUT23DCBhSrSP9Dqsw1_cZyESPSqVpwsduL6ghl6S5n4uuxHV-GzPIZ7_f6CRIZBGdhP-boFvQ0YCDiXKRv4I-JDMaIBsH-g/w400-h180/20250331_103820.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>View from our terrace</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Keen to show Andy and Amanda the sights in the area and our favourite places, on Monday we took them to Santa Pola which is about 7km from here. It is a fishing town with very long beaches and is a popular place for Spaniards to go on holiday. There are no large hotels, thus there is no mass tourism.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Our first stop was coffee at Cocco &amp; Latte in the main square by the castle, always a happy place for me and I hoped it would be for my friends.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8F_O2OBseCkeNj8SEOT3hEyNCoqnfp_x9e5DpY5uo0QD7aBThqjTPSW8Vx4-V45FJqEkZjXmHDzV2yzL04ZiUhs9tY-pfNBJ8WzdLEbXYeVYtG1L35g___O_SBn9nu9dB56Qixw6dmPl3taGlmLyu_SlA1FKLbyRZ2NR-lXe3AsOHiV2YaOPswA/s1600/IMG-20250331-WA0016.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8F_O2OBseCkeNj8SEOT3hEyNCoqnfp_x9e5DpY5uo0QD7aBThqjTPSW8Vx4-V45FJqEkZjXmHDzV2yzL04ZiUhs9tY-pfNBJ8WzdLEbXYeVYtG1L35g___O_SBn9nu9dB56Qixw6dmPl3taGlmLyu_SlA1FKLbyRZ2NR-lXe3AsOHiV2YaOPswA/w400-h300/IMG-20250331-WA0016.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Coffee in town - Santa Pola - on Monday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div>You will notice we are wearing cardigans. We did need them a bit but honestly the weather has been superb this week with the highest temperatures around 23ºc; perfect weather to be here in my mind.</div><div><br /></div><div>From there we took our friends for a stroll along the main beach in the town. Some people were sunbathing and swimming but none of us had brought our swimming gear. Here are some photos of our walk by the sea. The colour of the Mediterranean was what impressed my friends most. They live by the sea in Devon but it never gets that colour in England because of the climate.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMus4ciaf46ZjlF5X38HZumksdZJwHK1lJx9fS2fyFcecsAS5rATEOz_-Fov2O_GvXXNylrk2AuP7ETZ8UGHXq7ZegoNiomT1mQkJLtV_miZiQliEk0CumDH3O0lN26bC6y_Nr4xq2kLmWGyqfeMmElFTw-03sqcpw7dwVFFZ-OipVScm1EPinDQ/s1600/IMG-20250331-WA0003.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMus4ciaf46ZjlF5X38HZumksdZJwHK1lJx9fS2fyFcecsAS5rATEOz_-Fov2O_GvXXNylrk2AuP7ETZ8UGHXq7ZegoNiomT1mQkJLtV_miZiQliEk0CumDH3O0lN26bC6y_Nr4xq2kLmWGyqfeMmElFTw-03sqcpw7dwVFFZ-OipVScm1EPinDQ/w400-h300/IMG-20250331-WA0003.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiGDVUTL2r72Ij9Fjnv0ZEeQcDKfvhWt5k1DMmk6temA-9Y63MYEa6eRAG2PcaBgrITcBYOyJ4NS3x3csyfTp4kCuAd0W0-V4THrkw9lWL8-eVwtzwDexDVYCFkcJ7Z6JVbPKdOy4OERYGtVP0Dqx_KSl2vbtHlglBvymEm7G6u7YVtJearjA1bqQ/s1600/IMG-20250331-WA0010.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1200" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiGDVUTL2r72Ij9Fjnv0ZEeQcDKfvhWt5k1DMmk6temA-9Y63MYEa6eRAG2PcaBgrITcBYOyJ4NS3x3csyfTp4kCuAd0W0-V4THrkw9lWL8-eVwtzwDexDVYCFkcJ7Z6JVbPKdOy4OERYGtVP0Dqx_KSl2vbtHlglBvymEm7G6u7YVtJearjA1bqQ/w300-h400/IMG-20250331-WA0010.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>On the beach in Santa Pola on Monday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div>Lunch was at La Sal by the port, somewhere we had been on our last trip here.&nbsp;</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJiuYv5CjID-yyC1XjosHgMdNioPRzK7EbzrzrSVF5kAasbC1hFclaDP1L1q2rnwEWtnNDMmE0Q8t3-6LqiBCgQTdPhtU3V9gd613fRzu5pTj_qhqwT5WmyruzbQQy4g5bfu2EjM__FfltLAmcK9rVub18mkru9H1McFQWOWqPVQKN4t2QeE6WuA/s4032/20250331_145707.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1816" data-original-width="4032" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJiuYv5CjID-yyC1XjosHgMdNioPRzK7EbzrzrSVF5kAasbC1hFclaDP1L1q2rnwEWtnNDMmE0Q8t3-6LqiBCgQTdPhtU3V9gd613fRzu5pTj_qhqwT5WmyruzbQQy4g5bfu2EjM__FfltLAmcK9rVub18mkru9H1McFQWOWqPVQKN4t2QeE6WuA/w400-h180/20250331_145707.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Lunch at La Sal in Santa Pola on Monday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div>We had a marvelous menu of the day for a very reasonable price.

I now have&nbsp; Registry codes for all three of the properties we rent but what a nightmare it has been.<div><br /></div><div>On our way home, we stopped at the proverbial Mercadona to stock up on food for the week after which we came home to chill out. Amanda and I played our first game of ludo - I should add that we play Parchis, the Spanish version which is a lot more strategic. I wonder if you knew that that was the game Rafa Nadal would play in between matches. While we had been having a great day, a tragedy occurred in a mine in the north of Spain in Asturias. 5 miners, 4 from the town of Villablino in León, near Montrondo, lost their lives due to firedamp - an inflammable gas not often detected. I was very upset to hear that news and to know the men who died were from the area we know so well. RIP.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Tuesday</b> came and we stayed close to home. That was the day we finally did something about a cracked floor in the main living room here. A bump appeared last summer and we got the insurance people to come and take a look. On Tuesday they told us our policy wouldn't cover it. That really got us as we have been paying insurance for 25 years but have never claimed anything. This news had me scurrying to find floor tile specialists as there is no way we can rent this apartment with a broken floor because it is so unsightly. I found 2 men or companies and the estimates could not have been more different. We found out that the root cause is movement underground as the flats are built on a cliff. We also found out that this has occurred in many other flats in the same complex. To cut a long story short, the first builders advised that we change the whole floor of the flat at a price of nearly 8000 euros. The second builders, a Ukrainian and an Estonian, advised the opposite and said we only needed to repair the part that was damaged. The next day they gave us an estimate of 250 euros. Guess which we went for? They will be doing the work at the end of this month which is a huge relief.</div><div><br /></div><div>That morning it felt as though the flat was jinxed as on top of the cracked floor,&nbsp; a socket in the pantry had burned and we could not use the hot water, the washing machine or the air con for heat. Thankfully I had the contact of a local electrician and by 10 am, Luis was in our house and fixing it. He did another little job too all for the price of 70 euros.

They are the best prawns I have ever tasted.<div><br /></div><div><b>Wednesday</b> was the day we took our friends to Alicante, a city neither of them know and ended up loving. Alicante is quite an elegant seaside town and not as much affected by mass tourism as places such as Benidorm.&nbsp; Its best claim to fame is that is the sunniest city in Europe. The top landmarks are the beautiful Explanada and the medieval Castle of Santa Barbara.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>After parking by the lovely 5 star Melia Hotel, we walked to the Postiguet Beach just below the castle. Here people were bathing too. It is from this beach that many a TV journalist reports on the weather in Spain.

It never fails to impress and my friends were bowled over by it. It is made of mosaic and is designed to emulate the waves of the sea. It is so well done that it creates an optical illusion and you think it is moving as you walk on it.&nbsp; We took many photos and I chose my favourite for this week's feature photo,&nbsp; one of Amanda and I on the Explanada laughing our heads off.

I had been there once with my friends Sandra and Adele who loved it. Amanda and Andy were just as impressed. We were having such a good time and enjoying the food&nbsp; we forgot to take photos. My favourite dishes were the calamares, the potato salad and the oxtail which was divine. It's a place to go back to again and again.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>We were home late and tired but happy after such a wonderful day together. Mine was slightly interrupted by guest enquiries and bookings, mostly for the summer. I may be retired but I still work hahaha. While we were having a great time, Donald Trump was imposing the most extraordinarily high tariffs on most countries in the world for exporting goods to the USA. I have no time for the man and this week mostly skipped the news as it is so depressing.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>On <b>Thursday</b> we went on a trip down memory lane to Callosa and Bolulla. It was in these villages respectively that my mother and my aunt bought a house each in about 1973 towards the end of&nbsp; Franco's dictatorship. My mother's was on Calle de las Flores in Callosa and Aunty Masha's was on Calle Mayor in the tiny village of Bolulla. I once wrote the story of our Spanish adventure and how I came to live in Spain which <a href="https://mashalloyd.blogspot.com/2008/12/aunty-masha-laid-to-rest-russian.html?m=1">you can read here </a>if you are not familiar with it. Many friends came to stay. Amanda came out quite a few times and once she came with Andy. So for them this was a trip down memory lane too. I have such nostalgia for the Callosa days during which I fell in love with Eladio and always want to go back. It's 88km from our place so quite a drive. The interesting part starts after La Nucia from where we stopped to take a photo of the picturesque village of Polop.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6ya-gHRe-aaFc8ScjSjbNs6dDrGBtXH7Sm5o3pEMLouHgo6yuPg5gotfzWsxa8VVXxMwfabzERmqHH9JrFtBMOo8I7GROugBcmxaVhWdSpc3wY_OCDJ6GGE5D0O3_Sb305DfVKqbD7Aa3_eTlftwSC-Kf6_H9DFufYe61M4MaPosEITHx97W-pA/s4032/20250403_123036.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1816" data-original-width="4032" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6ya-gHRe-aaFc8ScjSjbNs6dDrGBtXH7Sm5o3pEMLouHgo6yuPg5gotfzWsxa8VVXxMwfabzERmqHH9JrFtBMOo8I7GROugBcmxaVhWdSpc3wY_OCDJ6GGE5D0O3_Sb305DfVKqbD7Aa3_eTlftwSC-Kf6_H9DFufYe61M4MaPosEITHx97W-pA/w400-h180/20250403_123036.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>La Nucia overlooking Polop</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div>From there it is a short drive to Callosa de Ensarría; a road I know well. I remember coming for the first time as an English teenager not knowing a word of Spanish or anything about country and suddenly being immersed in rural Southern Eastern Spain. There I was surrounded by orange and lemon trees and also medlar fruit trees which are grown intensively in Callosa. These days they also grow avocados. The road and mountains brought back so many memories as they always do. Once we had parked I led my friends to the ice cream bar, one of our old haunts. Called La Jijonenca, we used to go a lot and loved the home made "horchata" (tiger nut drink) and ice cream. The man at the bar was the nephew of Isabel who used to run it and we reminisced a lot with him. He made us feel welcome. Of course we had to have a photo taken outside. Everyone I take to Callosa gets to go to La Jijonenca.&nbsp;<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjaWidUUWACCzDfH7G9Gjttx-X1PHecsoS1Efi5jyZlYwfr9KkZyJwkp5I5W9jvvJGxpi2n6K_9JKEg48u9b-TMjsm4O7uf8iaoKQF1xEPd9A91Iqg7SLOh_NgfTR5gMGnT_91rG6n_4W5_Fd-RDxb5nvAbYOCs8_7JqpVPwsmfUoFGogkPWZsEVg/s1600/IMG-20250403-WA0015.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1200" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjaWidUUWACCzDfH7G9Gjttx-X1PHecsoS1Efi5jyZlYwfr9KkZyJwkp5I5W9jvvJGxpi2n6K_9JKEg48u9b-TMjsm4O7uf8iaoKQF1xEPd9A91Iqg7SLOh_NgfTR5gMGnT_91rG6n_4W5_Fd-RDxb5nvAbYOCs8_7JqpVPwsmfUoFGogkPWZsEVg/w300-h400/IMG-20250403-WA0015.jpg" width="300" /></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Outside the ice cream parlour, La Jijonenca, in Callosa</i></td></tr></tbody></table>The big pull of revisiting Callosa is to see our old house on Calle de las Flores. It means Flower street although there have never been any flowers. I have seen it many times over the years and know what to expect; a rather ramshackle&nbsp; old building which is actually quite ugly. But we thought it was heaven back in the day when our Spanish adventure began. Today no one lives there as most of the villagers prefer to live in flats rather than houses, believe it or not.

The place is paradise if somewhat difficult to climb up and down but well worth the visit.<div><br /></div><div>My dear husband who had missed his afternoon siesta drove us back and we arrived rather tired again but happy. We have had a very intensive week and being on holiday can be tiring can't it? Our time here has been blissful and we loved sharing our favourite places with our friends in such glorious weather.</div><div><br /></div><div>I slept well that night as I have done for most of the week - it must be the sea air and our friends' company.&nbsp; Later we had a light dinner, played cards (Sevens)&nbsp; during which I received a lovely message from Airbnb to tell me I am Super Host again. I get evaluated once every quarter and am pleased to tell you I have maintained this status since 2017 when I started hosting. It's hard work to keep it up but keep it up I will.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Friday</b> dawned and that was the day we took our friends to the Island of Tabarca. You would expect Spain, being a peninsula, to have many more islands like Greece or Finland, but apart from the Canaries and the Balearic Islands there are few. I just checked that fact and actually there are 176 but very very few are inhabited; just 11 in fact. Thus Tabarca is quite an anomaly where 49 people are supposed to live. In the past the island was used as a fortress, today it is visited by tourists who go for day trips, like us, to enjoy the views, the flora and fauna and to have lunch at one its many restaurants.&nbsp; And here we are on the fast boat which takes 15 minutes - the return boat took double.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4vTUva2dnarxbIKTO7T7NLKPXab5WSseYD7uiiWDdXEZO-XX3wlUD9Yhej8WMiFA3RO9o7IhKXIrpzNW7O5af21zXJwHDMmWumE0vKGRVvrxfDaB9qWwBUyT03htTHrfcHQY4VmJqxmG4AGvWXfPXcnjYvDhJQES90cvloClLFSnKRNJLGbWFPg/s4032/20250404_113936.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1816" data-original-width="4032" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4vTUva2dnarxbIKTO7T7NLKPXab5WSseYD7uiiWDdXEZO-XX3wlUD9Yhej8WMiFA3RO9o7IhKXIrpzNW7O5af21zXJwHDMmWumE0vKGRVvrxfDaB9qWwBUyT03htTHrfcHQY4VmJqxmG4AGvWXfPXcnjYvDhJQES90cvloClLFSnKRNJLGbWFPg/w400-h180/20250404_113936.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>On the boat to Tabarca on Friday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>At this point I should tell you that there is a popular open water swimming race that takes place anualy from Tabarca to Santa Pola (6km) in which 1600 people participate. It is supposedly the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.granalacantadvertiser.com/tabarca-swim/">best open swim race</a>&nbsp;in Spain and one of the best in the world. People come from all over the world and there are so many requests to take part the organisers have to use a lottery system. My claim to fame is that my son-in-law, Miguel, Oli's husband, has done it 10 times. I asked him how long he took and he said just over an hour which means he must have been in the top 10 or 20. If you take longer than 3.5h you are disqualified. I have read it's a very tough race fraught with dangers from currents, waves, jelly fish and of course exhaustion. At the finish line the Red Cross are there to treat the cold, those with cramp, those who are exhausted and those who have been stung by jelly fish. I have a new found respect for my son in law after seeing the video of the race and which you can see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoKUNzOf_XU">here</a>. I told my friends about the race and I think they were impressed.&nbsp;<br /><div><br /></div><div>Once off the ferry we walked to the town part of the island which is divided into two, one part is built and the other isn't.
