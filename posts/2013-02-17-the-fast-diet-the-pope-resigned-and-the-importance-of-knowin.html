<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Hi everyone,</span><br></br>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">How has your week
been?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Mine has been different, in that I
started the <a href="http://thefastdiet.co.uk/">Fast diet</a> (remember I wrote about it last week?) and on Monday I
experienced my first day of fasting – or rather semi fasting as on the two non
consecutive days of the week you “fast” you can only eat 500 calories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>For the “feed days” I was told I could eat 2000
calories but decided to stick to approx 1.500 as 2000 is far too much for me. Suzy
also started the diet so, although we weren’t together, we were, at least, able
to give each other moral support at a distance. For the record this is what I
decided to eat: Breakfast: porridge made of two spoonfuls of oat bran with 150ml
skimmed milk, coffee made with 100 ml skimmed and 50ml semi skimmed milk, Lunch:
a 40 calorie yoghurt and a cup of coffee with 100ml skimmed milk, Early evening:
a cup of herbal tea and one mandarin, Dinner: an omelette made with one big egg
and two slivers of lean ham grilled in 1tsp of oil, 5 boiled asparagus and one
40 calorie yoghurt. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">During the
fast day, I made sure my mind was not on food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It wasn’t so difficult in the morning but not joining my husband and my
Father for lunch was a bit of a sacrifice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I got a rumbling stomach occasionally and a few hunger pangs, but
otherwise got through the day the best I could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I didn’t feel any loss of energy and enjoyed our daily walk as
usual.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Dinner of course helped me get a
good night’s sleep and it felt like a banquet after eating so little during the
day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The great news on Tuesday morning
was that I had shed 1.5kg (3.3lb).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>After
the second day of fasting – Thursday – I was disappointed to see a loss of a
miserly 100 grammes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However I shall
persevere as I am not only seeking weight loss but all the health benefits the
diet promises – keeping the dreaded diseases of cancer, Parkinson, Alzheimer and
dementia at bay.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">So, on a
pretty empty stomach, on Monday I made my way to Alcobendas for my annual medical
checkup organized by the HR department at work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>In the past I hated going because I was overweight, but that is no
longer the case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Having kept slim now for
nearly three years and going for an hour long walk nearly every day of our
lives, I knew I was fit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So I was not surprised
to pass the medical with flying colours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I even think the lady doctor was surprised to see with how much ease I
was able to touch my toes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Just as I was
getting into the car, I checked my phone and saw the most surprising news; the
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/feb/11/pope-resigns-live-reaction">Pope, Benedict XVI, had just resigned</a>, apparently due to age and declining health.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I think the whole world went into shock as he
is the first Pope to do so in more than 600 years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The 85 year old Bavarian Pontiff announced his
resignation in Latin on Monday morning at a </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">regular public
consistory organized to canonize several blessed individuals; not a
particularly important event. </span></div>

announcement and there were very few journalists present.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>When Giovanna Chirri, who covers the Vatican
for Italy’s ANSA news agency, heard his whispering speech, she couldn’t believe
what she was hearing but understood every word as she knows Latin, unlike the
other journalists present and it because she knows Latin that she became the

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">The world went into shock and this has
been the main news of the week with plenty of speculation as to the real reasons
behind the Pope’s announcement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>There is
suspicion that the real reason is that the church is ungovernable because of in
fighting and that the aged German pontiff can no longer bear the pressure of
accusations of pederasty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Whatever the
reasons, he will step down on 28<sup>th</sup> February and probably retire to a
monastery in the Vatican devoting the rest of his life to prayer, meditation
and theology, three things I suspect he prefers to governing an unruly
Church.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>And now the race is on to choose
his replacement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The conclave will take
place in the middle of March and many are betting on the new Pope being a non
European, either an African or a South American.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I wonder, as others probably do too, whether
Benedict XVI has already settled the issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">I’m sure Olivia my daughter was
totally unaware of this breaking news as she was busy reporting on the snow at
Navacerrada in the mountain area of Madrid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I was able to watch her first report at 10.15 before going for my
medical.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">But I missed her at 12.15, although
I was able to see her second report on internet later on in the afternoon. She
had gathered together a group of school children enjoying the snow during their
morning break.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You can see the clip <a href="http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/la-manana-de-la-1/manana-1-11-02-13/1688041/">here</a>
if you fast forward to 12.10.  Olivia as a journalist will have envied Giovanna Chirri's moment of fame for being the first journalist to break the news of the Pope's resignation.  The next day, though, Olivia, like many journalists around the world, had to do an extensive report on the papal story. </span></div>

<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Eladio would have been unaware too, although very interested because of his clerical past,
as he was busy invigilating the Spanish Open University (UNED) exams.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He was to do so every morning of last week,
leaving the house early each day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He is
officially retired but continues as a part time UNED tutor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This week he was asked to give more lectures
or rather tutorials and the new subject he has taken on is the history of medieval
and renaissance philosophy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>There is no subject my cultured
husband cannot put his hand to and I am very proud of him.</span></div>

<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">I think my niece Paula was probably
unaware too of the news of the Pope resigning as she had her own good news that
morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She has landed the job of
communications officer for the Dutch insurance company, Aegon, in Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Her boss will be my friend and ex colleague,
Marta.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was instrumental in her getting
an interview, but it is Paula’s merit that she landed the job; being the best
candidate. I am very happy that the two will be working together and wish my
sweet and beautiful niece lots of luck in her new job. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Tuesday was 12<sup>th</sup>
February, a date ingrained in my memory since childhood. It was my brother
George’s birthday, just four days after mine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>He would have been 58 but sadly died in 2001 on 15<sup>th</sup> May aged
just 46, too young to leave this wonderful world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He will never be forgotten.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">On Tuesday I had a belated birthday
lunch with the girls from my events agency, <a href="http://www.agenciaquintaesencia.com/">QuintaEsencia</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Bea, Cristina and Gloria treated me to lunch
at a new <a href="http://norestaurant.es/index.html#centro">restaurant in Madrid called No</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It had a special meaning for us all as the restaurant belongs to the Antoñanzas
brothers who are also owners of the events agency I used to work with and where
the three sisters learned their trade; Comunica.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Amazingly, Jaime, the brother I know best, was
there too and it was nice to greet him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>We hadn’t seen each other for maybe ten years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Of course we have aged but I well remember
Jaime when I was in my thirties working for Motorola and the wonderful events
we did together in Lisbon and Madrid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
learned part of my trade from him too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Thursday of course was St. Valentine’s
day but it was also my second day of fasting, so there was to be no celebration
dinner with Eladio that night. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Instead I
booked a table for Friday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Meanwhile, to
take food off my mind, I did some retail shopping that day at Gran Plaza Norte
2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Here I discovered that black and
white is very much in fashion, or at least that they were selling a lot of black
and white articles at H+M and Zara. Weighing a bit less, I spent a bit more
than I should but purchased some lovely clothing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>At Zara I invested in a pair of black and white
vertical striped skinny jeans, a black blazer with a wonderful black and white
vertical striped lining, a white shirt, a black and white vertical striped
blouse and my favourite item; a black leather pinafore dress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>At H+M I bought a black jumper and a navy
blue jumper and the best find of the day, a striking and flattering tight
fitting black and white harlequin type dress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">

Games legless runner, the dashing Oscar Pistorius, was <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/9873073/Oscar-Pistorius-athlete-denies-murder-of-Reeva-Steenkamp-in-strongest-terms.html">accused of killing his girlfriend</a>, the beautiful model, Reeva Steenkamp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>My ex South African colleague at Nokia,
Tanya, shares the same surname as the model and for a while I was worried they
were related.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Tanya told me later that
they weren’t but that the whole country was in shock.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">But that night, my mind was on
celebrating St. Valentine’s Day with my beloved husband. I had booked a table
via the restaurant website, <a href="http://www.eltenedor.es/3_restaurante/restaurante_C_Madrid/23/">El Tenedor</a> which offers discounts at selected restaurants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I wanted to try somewhere new and found just
one restaurant with a discount at nearby Villaviciosa de Odón, a place called “<a href="http://www.restaurantecostavasca.es/">Costa Vasca</a>” (Basque Coast).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I have always
thought that the Basque Country in Spain offers the best cuisine so hoped I had
made the right choice. It turned out we were the only diners in a rather old
and slightly shabby dining room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However
the owner’s wife who is the restaurant chef, is from Bilbao and we were served
delicious food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I’m not sure we will be
going back soon, but maybe we will in the summer as they have a terrace with a
garden where the atmosphere will be better than their dining room.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Saturday was quiet, the highlight
being lunch when we were joined by both girls and Olivia’s boyfriend Miguel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I should have mentioned earlier that he came
on Monday to stay the week with her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He
is very sporty and as I have written before here, Olivia now runs and swims,
skis and even goes paragliding with him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Yesterday before lunch they went off for a 5km run and this is what they
looked like.</span></div>
