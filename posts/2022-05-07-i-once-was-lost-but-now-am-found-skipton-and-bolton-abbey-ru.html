We brought him home and they are now reunited. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">Good morning everyone.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">What an emotional and marvelous week it has been here in Yorkshire. Our programme has been jam packed since I wrote last week when there was so much to look forward to. I was determined to enjoy every moment of the programme which I had carefully prepared in advance. The first 4 days were to be quiet and slow paced to get ready for this week when I knew I would have to be on top form.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Last Sunday was a very English Sunday in many ways. I had a need to go to church, to Patrick Brontë's parish church here in Haworth. You see the last time I had been to a church in England with my father was there. I am not usually a church going person but attending a service in an Anglican church in the country I was born is something special for me and I had a calling to go that day. My husband went along with me although I think he did not understand the reasons I needed to go. Attending Sunday service took me back to my early life when I lived in England and whether I believe or not, it was part of the need to go back to my roots. The service did not disappoint even though I knew none of the hymns.  What made them marvelous though was the accompaniment of a fabulous brass band. Just everything was perfect. The vicar was marvelous and during his sermon he said something that was a wonderful take away for me. He was talking about Easter and the Resurrection. He said this was a time of something new happening, that we should go along with it and that we would find our place. I wish I had remembered his exact words. It is exactly what was happening to me. After FT has gone, we are starting a new and wonderful chapter. It seems the bad patch is over and now we can enjoy life again. I have found my place again after being lost. Later the words from the lyrics of John Newton's beautiful hymn, Amazing Grace which Suzy sang at the burial, came to me: "<i>I once was lost but now am found</i>".  That is how I have felt ever since I stepped on English ground. Can you understand me? There I was in the church which felt so right and fitting as did the words. I felt uplifted at the end and came out feeling so happy with the world. The new chapter had started with my return to England and bringing my father home. Only good things could come from this. From the moment I touched English soil all I had was good news and everything was falling into place and help was everywhere. When we left the church, another coincidence happened. A man came up to us asking "Are you the ones from Spain?" Obviously word had got around. It was none other than D. Pearson, the West Yorkshire Deputy Lieutenant who would be representing Her Majesty the Queen at my father's Memorial Service. What a wonderful man he is and I warmed to him immediately. He explained all the pomp they had planned which I had no idea about but would see with my own eyes on Friday. We even agreed to travel to the Cathedral together as he lives in Haworth.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">My soul felt healed as I walked down the stone steps from the church to the square where my husband was waiting for me and as he still loves me so much he took photographs to treasure the moment like this one.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8F6uVZ3yvHbcMp-4bsEEb6xLR_RtKrcmVay4QF0vcTOwUGH69HYqEUK5OZlObxG2cFQ1sWdqCxDeGc0UL3p2RQ5PpWn3lShwtLG2hhKF4wcfn7v84lJEAnbBcUBVv-y2qmFod5C6gKuMy_d36cuHtHWj_-siYTsGPRJocTFgRrTrXjCyJ8Uo/s1600/Sun%20church.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj8F6uVZ3yvHbcMp-4bsEEb6xLR_RtKrcmVay4QF0vcTOwUGH69HYqEUK5OZlObxG2cFQ1sWdqCxDeGc0UL3p2RQ5PpWn3lShwtLG2hhKF4wcfn7v84lJEAnbBcUBVv-y2qmFod5C6gKuMy_d36cuHtHWj_-siYTsGPRJocTFgRrTrXjCyJ8Uo/w194-h400/Sun%20church.jpg" width="194"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>After the Sunday service in Haworth last week</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">The next item on the programme of our very English Sunday was going to a pub; The Fleece which everyone had recommended to us. There we were to meet up with our dearest friends Kathy (from school) and Phil, her lovely husband who was a teacher of Spanish and Eladio's companion. We hadn't seen each other since before the Pandemic but had spoken on the phone regularly since then. Oh what a joyous reunion. I couldn't stop hugging my friend Kathy. We had prosecco which we are loving while they had beer or ale as it is more often called in Yorkshire.  My friends had booked a table for lunch at the very popular Hawthorn restaurant/pub. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi55uCjiXIOdRmC1VPxLt3l4749tlr0SI46yhaBwGEHcbn0pzbYwMzPgn3STOPWTMgtNTeaTktFNyqTWxIxFF4QMqlR2dRG7A-mI_f0_Z--a_hZzQOO0rva7oFAZkO2RZB5vanW6scmwIYAIbi5xNoQkDeqDROVi5CB9xqmQlbr-LIZ-J8s-WY/s1024/Sun%20K%20and%20P.jpeg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi55uCjiXIOdRmC1VPxLt3l4749tlr0SI46yhaBwGEHcbn0pzbYwMzPgn3STOPWTMgtNTeaTktFNyqTWxIxFF4QMqlR2dRG7A-mI_f0_Z--a_hZzQOO0rva7oFAZkO2RZB5vanW6scmwIYAIbi5xNoQkDeqDROVi5CB9xqmQlbr-LIZ-J8s-WY/w400-h300/Sun%20K%20and%20P.jpeg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Lunch with our dear friends Phil and Kathy</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Thus our very English Sunday would be complete with a Sunday roast for lunch.

In the end I went for the latter while my 3 companions went for the lamb. The meal was outstanding. Just look at my plate.There was no difficulty choosing the "pudding".For me it had to be one of my favourites; sticky toffee pudding; such a British dessert and only to be found here. No doubt I have put on quite a lot of weight during my stay here so far. All I can wear are leggings and loose dresses. Oh well, we are on holiday and anything is permitted while on holiday. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgh2OuoZBdtFsAPH1pFwx549TotC-EryscOMrCH0d5JE3bFejT65u1XqGbua2RyX4-Qnmjyvuv0u5Woqt8XbJoZs_9lukjeg308kNUdlHepxgeahYI83i52_wdx3Lb0hWWrarKhQs5KHTcV4Cc38VgcLx8gDa9hLokekEojpf670TQfi80bok8/s4032/Sun%20stickly%20toffee%20pudding.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgh2OuoZBdtFsAPH1pFwx549TotC-EryscOMrCH0d5JE3bFejT65u1XqGbua2RyX4-Qnmjyvuv0u5Woqt8XbJoZs_9lukjeg308kNUdlHepxgeahYI83i52_wdx3Lb0hWWrarKhQs5KHTcV4Cc38VgcLx8gDa9hLokekEojpf670TQfi80bok8/w400-h180/Sun%20stickly%20toffee%20pudding.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Sticky toffee pudding at The Hawthorn</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">The problem when we have a hearty lunch including alcohol is that we are in desperate need of a nap afterwards. That is certainly Eladio's case as his eyes begin to shut. We drove back to our cottage with everyone shouting different instructions to my husband as to how to get here which was hilarious. It's under a mile but we never seem to find the right way hahaha.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We showed our friends our nice but humble and tiny abode and they both agreed it was tiny but nice. We like it but my goodness the second bedroom is like a box room. The cottage is fine for 2 but not for more. Our friends were tired too and shortly left. Maybe to add to our very English Sunday we should have gone on a walk but we felt lazy. Thus I put my pyjamas on and slumped on the sofa in front of the TV and promptly fell asleep until 9 pm. I think I was finally catching up on lost sleep. My husband gently woke me and said we should have some dinner. I was groggy and had a headache (from the prosecco) and needed time to wake up. In the end I just had fruit but couldn't resist one of Betty's little fondant cakes - they are delicious. That night we went to bed early and although I woke up a few times overall I slept well and woke up feeling rested. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was <b>Monday</b> 2nd May, a bank holiday here and was our last day of being alone before the programme became jam packed. We decided on visiting Skipton where we would have our lunch - fish and chips at <a href="http://www.bizzielizzies.co.uk/">Bizzie Lizzies</a> (where else?) and then go for a walk to Bolton Abbey, both important old haunts from my childhood. Once in Skipton we went to get food at M&S food (where else again?) next door to Bizzie Lizzies. We stocked up on prosecco, cider, fruit and good bread as well as my downfall; Battenberg cake (adore it) which we left in the car. It was a bit early for lunch so we ambled along High Street the main thoroughfare in Skipton which by the way is often called The Gateway to the Dales. Like Ilkley, it has made it to the top of the list of the best towns to live in England. It is beautiful and I always include it on my bucket list when in my beloved Yorkshire. There was a market and we got a nice plant as a birthday present for David Jones - my father's old pupil - who we would be meeting on Tuesday in Ruskington (more about that later). We enjoyed the atmosphere and looking in the enticing shops but only bought nappies from Boots for Juliet when she came and a notebook for me as I never have any paper to write on - you can't always use your phone.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Lunch at Bizzie Lizzies was good and we enjoyed a fair portion of England's most popular dish.

It was raining when we parked but that did not put me off. With a raincoat and umbrella we braced the weather and were fortunate it was just a short shower.

The first time Eladio visited England was at Christmas in 1980 and I took him to Bolton Abbey and remember taking lots of photos. We went back in the summer. At home in our bedroom there is a photo of me by the Abbey which Eladio had enlarged and framed. So you see, this place means a lot to both of us. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">All in all we had a great day and were lucky once again with the weather. The drive "home" took just half an hour. <b>Tuesday</b> would be great too as Tuesday was the day I had planned for us to visit Ruskington. Ruskington is a little village in Lincolnshire, near Sleaford and Cranwell College (where my father taught) and where we lived from 1960 to 1964 before we moved to Bradford. I think I told you in my last post that I had written to the current owners of "our bungalow" on Rectory Road and that they were delighted for us to visit. Waiting there for us would be one of my father's most important "old boys", David J who lives in Lincolnshire and was keen for us to visit. So were we. I had only been back once since we left when I was only 7 and that was with Eladio and my parents probably in about 1982; so a very long time. I was keen to see the old house, the church, my maternal grandmother's grave and my old school if it still existed. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We aimed to leave early that morning as it is a long drive, 2.5h for just 130 or so miles but not all of it is motorway. We left a little later as the article in the Yorkshire Post with my father's story was published that day. Remember I told you about an interview with this most prestigious regional paper last week? I found a copy and bought two at a Co Op in Keighley and was so pleased to see the story had made it to page 3.

Caroline works for the paper and is always helping me bless her.

The sub heading was great too: <b>"<span style="color: #6c6c6c; font-family: Merriweather; font-size: 16px;">A war hero, intelligence officer, skilled linguist and school master, Charles Courtenay Lloyd lived a life of service to his country and to his beloved Yorkshire". </span></b></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I was very pleased as you can imagine. On our way to Ruskington I received various emails from the Bradford local government. I was tickled pink to get this message: "<i>Hi, I  received a call from the County Chair of the Royal British Legion, Bill Mason, who will be attending the memorial service on Friday. He would like to know if you would like the County Standard Bearer (with the  Standard) present also?</i>" Not at all sure what a County Standard Bearer was, I said I was delighted. Well, I mean, the more pomp the better. Oh the Brits are so good at pomp aren't they?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We arrived outside our old house at around 11.30 and there were Graeme the owner and David my father's pupil who had just turned 73 that same day, waiting for us. It was such a warm welcome. We were ushered into our old bungalow. Yes there are lots of changes but the structure inside is the same. I recognised my room, my brother's room, my parent's room, the bathroom, the lounge with the fireplace, the study and the dining room. I also recognised the kitchen. The garden was not the same though as the owners after us sold part of the acre of land. We spent quite a bit of time inside our old house and it felt so good. Memories came rushing back. By then Caroline, Graeme's wife, had joined us and we had lots to talk about. We took photos too like the one of everyone outside our old house.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgj_03t_h8Pm-GDZNXTEwwaLWAcm_P7MV94L-TR7e6NzFfplU7BzPx-6a-pLE8zhum0FqhEJRR7Mo-_tigXAYciBPyhBZa5TELvjh88brXkpzawxIU9g-m3vyQXCnNGu1iVHykfyw8f3UPJ7VVJYkto-JrOyNM0ibeWLFGyWE30akNXgwoMnMs/s4032/20220503_131322.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgj_03t_h8Pm-GDZNXTEwwaLWAcm_P7MV94L-TR7e6NzFfplU7BzPx-6a-pLE8zhum0FqhEJRR7Mo-_tigXAYciBPyhBZa5TELvjh88brXkpzawxIU9g-m3vyQXCnNGu1iVHykfyw8f3UPJ7VVJYkto-JrOyNM0ibeWLFGyWE30akNXgwoMnMs/w400-h180/20220503_131322.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Outside our old house</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">The owners told us the bungalow was built in 1922.

A Russian orthodox priest came from London specially and he prayed and chanted at her uncovered body lying in a coffin in the lounge all night and waving incense. I remember feeling very frightened. I wonder if anyone in Ruskington knows that a Russian princess is buried in the cemetery?  She was born Sophie Stachovich and when she married my grandfather she became HSH Princess Lieven. Her genteel life ended with the Russian revolution when, pregnant with my mother, the family fled Russia in 1920.

There would be Amanda, my St. Josephs' College friend, her brother Simon who went to Bradford Grammar School and his BGS friends who became our friends too; Mark and his wife Sarah who we were meeting for the first time,  Chris and Andy. Andy became Amanda's husband. There too was Simon's delightful wife, Gill. I had not seen Chris since Amanda's wedding in 2005 and as to Mark, the last time I saw him was when he was about 20, so 45 years ago. The three "old boys", Mark, Andy and Chris were all in my father's 4X form at BGS when they were about 11. Chris brought his school report written by my father in about 1967 and he had kept it all these years. In it my father praises him as a good scholar. So our reunion was to be very, very special. We were to meet for lunch at 12.30 at The Red Lion in the pretty village of Burnsall in the Yorkshire Dales. As teenagers we often went on day trips to the Dales but never had lunches in pubs, more like drinks and bags of crisps, hahahaha.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Before heading off to Burnsall we went to a garden centre in Harden to order flowers for my father's memorial events which I should not have left to the last minute but there were no problems. From the garden centre near Bingley we drove to Sainsbury's in Keighley to stock up for the girls' stay with us. Oh how I love British supermarkets. My favourites are Waitrose and M&S food but Sainsbury's is good enough.

Last time we didn't have time to visit the Strid, that very narrow and dangerous part of the River Wharfe. We reached the main entrance nearly an hour before we had to be in Burnsall and on the spur of the moment stopped to take a walk down to the river for "old times' sake". Let me explain, it is apparently the most dangerous stretch of water in the world and my mother used to be terrified when we went. It's very narrow at certain points and people jump across it on rather slippery rocks. Lives have been taken there as there are pot holes and the water will suck you in. So it's beautiful to look at but you have to keep well away from the edge. My brother George used to jump across it which worried me but then we didn't dare tell my mother or she'd have a heart attack. Even so, I'm always drawn to it and as we had time on our hands it was the perfect moment. It's a short walk from the road through thick forest which is so beautiful I can't describe it. I read that the famous British painter Turner painted the Strid in 1808 - interesting.

We got talking and it turns out he is a teacher at Bradford Grammar School, like my father was. What a small world!!!! He told me he saw my father's photo on the Common Room corridor every day. I later sent him the links to the articles in the T&A and the Yorkshire Post which his wife, Loretta, said were fascinating. He told us we were the first guests at their cottage.

Great fun were the group photos of my father's old boys  - 12 of them, ranging in all ages from those who left in 1966 to those who left in his final year, 1983. What a moment to see them all gathered there because they wanted to be at their old teacher's funeral, the teacher who had inspired them so much. I had to be in it too as many of them were my friends in the 70's and it was wonderful have them there: My father reunited so many people that day. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhGT8WXOELkJ3oTwQ3B3S-LMO9_c33Kf6G6Q37MImACCyAmGBV9e_KyNuM4MCzDsiEIerJWUmnLdgUb1H54o_qpfvWWQN2klQdPvDGlktB6HtNXhT_HGBmHX_slI1v_iJChZJgISSVGbkONTDVt2Ri1TAxTJ18QR_lSys5eHSpRPhRwKNSexfM/s3216/Memorial%20Service-085.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="265" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhGT8WXOELkJ3oTwQ3B3S-LMO9_c33Kf6G6Q37MImACCyAmGBV9e_KyNuM4MCzDsiEIerJWUmnLdgUb1H54o_qpfvWWQN2klQdPvDGlktB6HtNXhT_HGBmHX_slI1v_iJChZJgISSVGbkONTDVt2Ri1TAxTJ18QR_lSys5eHSpRPhRwKNSexfM/w400-h265/Memorial%20Service-085.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Me with my father's "old boys"</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">One in particular I was keen to see and who I hadn't seen since I was in 6th form; Bill O.

That day I wanted to show my family, the girls in particular, Yorkshire in all its glory.  That morning we did something incredibly special. We were taken on a VIP trip on the Worth Valley Railway which goes from Haworth to Keighley and is an old restored steam train with carriages from the 40's and 50's. It is the setting of the 1970 and more recent update of The the film The Railway Children. Our host was none other than the Deputy Lord Lieutenant of West Yorkshire who lives in Haworth and is much involved with the railway. Mark, a friend, commented on the photos I posted: "It's like watching the Spanish Royal family on tour in Yorkshire"!! We received the famous Yorkshire hospitality which we appreciated so much. What a tour and what a morning.
