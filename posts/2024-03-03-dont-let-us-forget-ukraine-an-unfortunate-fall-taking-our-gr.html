Mine has had its ups and downs as you will read. On the world scene, we heard this week just how many people have died since Putin's army invaded Ukraine.</div><div><br></br></div><div>I don't want the world to forget Ukraine because of news fatigue. 31.000 Ukrainian soldiers and 10.5k civilians have died since the war started 2 years ago. An estimated 300.000 Russian soldiers have also perished. I feel for all their mothers and I feel too for those young Russian men who I'm sure don't want to fight this futile war. Over 6 million refugees fled Ukraine and an estimated 8 million were displaced. Just imagine that in your country. This week saw the French President, Emmanuel Macron suggest NATO send troops. I doubt that will happen but the very mention of it had Putin saying he would retaliate with nuclear weapons. In two weeks time this maniac who has been in power since 2012 will be reelected in the upcoming general elections where, with all his opposition, out of the way, including the bravest of them all, Alexei Navalny who was finally laid to rest this week. This week I had the opportunity to speak to a young Ukrainian boy who works at the DIY store, Leroy Merlin and to tell him how sorry I am for his country.  I heard him and a friend speaking and asked whether they were from Russia or Ukraine. Ukrainians they said and  told me they were already living here before the war started and could think of not much else. Of course. I got the opportunity to say the words "Slava Ukraini" in person and I meant it.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Last <b>Sunday</b> was a quiet day for us. I was having trouble with my mouth - there was a splinter in one of molars which was causing me hell but I couldn't go to the dentist until Monday - would be Tuesday in the end, as you will read on. We braved the cold on our walk and it felt more like winter than spring. Tana was off so I had to make our lunch and I resorted to Russian "bitki" (meat patties similar to hamburgers) with potato pure as I can only really eat soft food - boohoo. </div><div><br></br></div><div>I spent the afternoon binge watching old episodes of Call the Midwife - true BBC comfort TV. I turned to Season 2 where Sister Bernadette (Shelagh) and Dr. Turner (Patrick) fall in love. That has always been my favourite part. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Later I played mother when I made a chicken Tikka Masala for our lovely lodger, Mohammad from Irak. I never got to taste it as I am supposedly on a diet. He told me it was wonderful and that his Indian friend, Sangar had asked for the recipe. That is high praise indeed. </div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Monday</b> came and was not a good day. Our walk took us to the nearest shopping centre about 3.5km from home for coffee. It was on the way back that my husband tripped on the pavement while stepping onto the road. He lost his balance and fell over completely head down. He lost consciousness and his nose and cheeks were bleeding a bit. There was also a noticeable bump on his right temple. It took me a while to get him to sit up but we managed. I was able to leave him leaning against a car bonnet while I hailed a passing car. The man was youngish and helped Eladio into the car and drove us home. As we got home the carpenter who my husband was expecting, was outside our gate but Eladio had no idea who he was. That was when I got worried. Between us we got him into the house and I rang the emergency services, 112 in Spain, like 999 in the UK. Except that I didn't know that as Eladio has private insurance the 112 people wouldn't help. But the police arrived as is protocol when you ring 112. I could have rung his private insurance number and got an ambulance to come but we all agreed it would be faster if I took him myself by car which is what I did. My dear husband was in shock. He had obviously had concussion and didn't remember any part of the fall or accident. As soon as we arrived we were ushered into A&E, Eladio going in in a wheel chair. When I rang 112, I panicked and asked Tana to call Olivia to join us. As she wasn't really able to tell our daughter what had happened, she was very shocked. Soon Eladio was in one of the boxes and being attended by a young Argentinian doctor. I took a photo which I probably shouldn't have done as Eladio said not to tell anyone (typical of him) but I did - it's to record the unfortunate fall last Monday which gave us all such a shock.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhG0ERDFjqdmGicZ7Teg5T8W8GV4JEWVT9UgMDaxYpJfWHhGX3hIpXlDEEveJNQZTuaq5C5TmkwCUbVdo4HspCehDI32Yk1wTvOayshe7PStU6miqb_sqcGZ_iNB56kWz0WOSpu1yp7hz4PvZg7AB68ngdEg_jUorAWpWeRWx1c67euT7d7sbX7gQ/s4032/20240226_141108.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhG0ERDFjqdmGicZ7Teg5T8W8GV4JEWVT9UgMDaxYpJfWHhGX3hIpXlDEEveJNQZTuaq5C5TmkwCUbVdo4HspCehDI32Yk1wTvOayshe7PStU6miqb_sqcGZ_iNB56kWz0WOSpu1yp7hz4PvZg7AB68ngdEg_jUorAWpWeRWx1c67euT7d7sbX7gQ/w180-h400/20240226_141108.jpg" width="180"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgYyA1c-9aRrMOd_mf-orFGl_Ttf58BaEXPqBbh-b-dKp-YSQ46u_2GlTdLdKzNL9MfG9psMTMQfmXENaQE_F6kugL2Q6B94hR_Cr6gO25GHlqwZc3t1uwHM42Jm2KJQ2i29dH6zGA-lANcAYYpejHGLY21j3kgVYDZ0cr5j56muwa7awJ0dgIDAA/s1599/IMG-20240226-WA0007.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgYyA1c-9aRrMOd_mf-orFGl_Ttf58BaEXPqBbh-b-dKp-YSQ46u_2GlTdLdKzNL9MfG9psMTMQfmXENaQE_F6kugL2Q6B94hR_Cr6gO25GHlqwZc3t1uwHM42Jm2KJQ2i29dH6zGA-lANcAYYpejHGLY21j3kgVYDZ0cr5j56muwa7awJ0dgIDAA/w225-h400/IMG-20240226-WA0007.jpg" width="225"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio at the hospital on Monday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>I had to be with him when the doctor examined him as he didn't remember anything about the fall and according to her, probably never will. She asked him many questions and made him do all sorts of movements to eliminate the possibility of a stroke. They then shuttled him off to do a CCT scan. He seemed ok as you can see in the photo above with Olivia. The doctor saw the images but told us to wait for the final report from the radiologist. It didn't come until 6 pm but was such a relief. The conclusion was "no damage to the brain" or similar words in Spanish. Oli suggested we celebrate. We will soon.<div><br></br></div><div>Only then could we go home. I had missed my dental appointment to remove the splinter so stuck a piece of chewed chewing gum on it (I even had to sleep like that). We hadn't had lunch and were starving and very grateful to Tana for heating up some soup and lentil pure. That would serve as both our lunch and dinner that day. We only had an hour and a half to rest before we both went to Oli's house as the next day we had to take the children to school. The doctor had told us Eladio could not be left alone for 48h after the fall in case something happened. Thus we went together. Neither of us got much sleep I can tell you and felt pretty dead the next day but all was well which is the important thing.</div><div><br></br></div><div>On <b>Tuesday</b> morning, I was woken up by Juliet at 5.45 and couldn't go back to sleep again. Thankfully she did. So I had some breakfast and took a shower. At about 7 am, Elliot got up which woke up his grandfather (Booboo). I took this photo of them having breakfast together.</div><div><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwhF6_0ebInfQ_ytIMHu0Opnb0FzxZSEYEL_V_nsidtOrMvd6otweJWbiBSfa0rozBi2aE91T2ilhh-MPTwgeQYENTKUm0qyHBbuGhiI-CFsmPbLN9YOhc4KgR_Nu8W4h-0K84b_bIZaLZDsdqVNHPKxuqiRyse4D91bNjKOLG9Wa034vT62EVUQ/s4032/20240227_074518.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhwhF6_0ebInfQ_ytIMHu0Opnb0FzxZSEYEL_V_nsidtOrMvd6otweJWbiBSfa0rozBi2aE91T2ilhh-MPTwgeQYENTKUm0qyHBbuGhiI-CFsmPbLN9YOhc4KgR_Nu8W4h-0K84b_bIZaLZDsdqVNHPKxuqiRyse4D91bNjKOLG9Wa034vT62EVUQ/w180-h400/20240227_074518.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio and Elliot having breakfast together on Tuesday morning</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>When Juliet woke up again, she came into the kitchen and the first thing she did was kiss her brother.

She is going through the "terrible twos" and tends to fight at school. Elliot told me she doesn't have many friends because they are afraid of her. That made me laugh. I remember being told by the teachers at Suzy's school when she was about the same age, that she had a tendency to bite the other children. Oh the joys of bringing up toddlers!<div><br></br></div><div>Taking them to school went well and we were free by 9.05 am. We went straight back home and to bed. I could have stayed in bed all morning but got a phone call from my hairdresser to say she had a cancellation and if I wanted my hair done that day instead of next week. So off I went. I was all done and dusted by 12.30 or so and all for just 19 euros. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Both of us had to go out in the afternoon, me to the dentist to finally remove the splinter and Eladio to the park to look after the kids while Oli went off to her Tuesday afternoon French lesson. I joined them at home when I got back from the dentist. They are far more docile in the mornings that in the evenings but somehow we managed to keep them entertained. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We were in bed by 9pm and watching the news. For me the most important item of news this week, barring Navalny's funeral, was the story of the go ahead (finally) from Hungary to allow Sweden to join NATO. Now both Finland and Sweden have joined the Atlantic Alliance. No doubt that was not good news for Vladimir Putin but damn him.</div><div><br></br></div><div>On <b>Wednesday</b> we had lots of things to do. First we went back to the hospital. It was to get the CD of the CCT scan for if it's needed in the future. We then went to El Corte Inglés about a fairly new washing machine we have which is not working. Turns out that as we bought it online, I had to ring the online people. Thus we ended up just having coffee there, at the brand new Starbucks. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Lunchtime was hectic. Guests were leaving, other guests were arriving, Amazon was delivering something and all during our lunch time. My Balkan guests from Slovenia, Serbia and Bosnia, kept renewing their stay as they loved it here. </div><div><br></br></div><div>This may only be women's football news but these days it has become much more important - hurray - so I am delighted to tell you that the Spanish team beat France in the Women's Nations League, their second big title after winning the world cup last year. Thankfully this win was not marred by an unwanted kiss. This means the Spanish women's football team get an automatic place in the Paris Olympics this summer. </div><div><br></br></div><div>The worst news that day was of course the Israeli air attack on a huge group of Palestinians crowding round humanitarian lorries to get food in Gaza. They are starving. I don't quite buy the reason they were bombed and more than 100 killed - because the Israeli soldiers' lives were in danger. Honestly, opening fire on people seeking food has absolutely no excuse. See the images for yourself if you haven't already seen them. This is just one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBDrCbWpbfc">video</a> I found. The Israelis further tried to lay the blame for the deaths because of being crushed by the lorries but images suggest otherwise. For example medics who attended the wounded said they had bullet wounds. </div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Thursday</b> came and it was Leap Day, 29th February, a date that only occurs every 4 years. It is to make up for the fact that the year isn't exactly 365 days but rather 365.242190. It is a mathematical muddle I cannot explain. For us mere mortals it means February has one extra day every 4 years. For those born on 29th February it must pose a problem when it comes to their birthday. I suppose they celebrate it on 28th when it is not a Leap year. </div><div><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO-jn5esquk6kKaTuLKXdyn0Nf_zkYOAVLLQ7DClbwlQ5OIJM9eRyRLkFVT8-a2aut9ehJmBYmvA7dzsPQdiQH-AJNYPPAXmQdTJy08l6nSKyA9fF9iStXDtp3JO8Xtgn-nJ8MJyNjW_Vfawbp09JLpEtSopgTfd0KH4guSNDIpMzUfQnwSnaC_Q/s1385/happy-leap-day-on-29-february-with-cute-frog-in-flat-style-cartoon-hand-drawn-background-templates-illustration-2M078FC.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO-jn5esquk6kKaTuLKXdyn0Nf_zkYOAVLLQ7DClbwlQ5OIJM9eRyRLkFVT8-a2aut9ehJmBYmvA7dzsPQdiQH-AJNYPPAXmQdTJy08l6nSKyA9fF9iStXDtp3JO8Xtgn-nJ8MJyNjW_Vfawbp09JLpEtSopgTfd0KH4guSNDIpMzUfQnwSnaC_Q/s320/happy-leap-day-on-29-february-with-cute-frog-in-flat-style-cartoon-hand-drawn-background-templates-illustration-2M078FC.jpg" width="300"></img></a></div>The only reason I can think of behind the name is that every 4 years we leap forward one year. In Spanish there is no possible translation of "Leap Day" although there is a word for a Leap Year which is "año bisiesto". <br></br><div><br></br></div><div>We were busy again that day.  First Eladio received some people who may be installing solar panels on our roofs. It's something we have been toying with for a while. We were put off by the high initial cost which has now gone down but in any case payback will take 8 years. It will possibly halve the electricity bill and and reduce the council tax. ·My husband thinks it will add value to the house. Maybe it will but maybe when we sell it, there will be some more modern technology in place. Let's see. Watch this space. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Then my friends we went looking for a dustbin. Funny, eh, but yes. We can't recycle well in our street as there is only one container outside. But now it seems our street will catch up with the rest of the world and we will be having 3 containers. Our old dustbin was more than 20 years old and honestly needed replacing. So, off we went. For the occasion I wore a new jumper which arrived this week from a firm called <a href="https://sartoro.com/">Sartoro</a>. I had seen it on Instagram and instantly bought it. I had forgotten I had ordered it but was very pleased when it came and of course had to wear it at the next opportunity which was Thursday morning. As I didn't have any suitable feature photo for this week, I got Eladio to take some. This is another. I should add I am now able to get into my lovely yellow Decathlon puffer jacket which matches perfectly.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEirAeq7N1NRFAQOBceb2ad0euBTZQ8yliSimpR10fUS_i2TO53rkprSIHZWeCwGV9I08hw7Urjeu_kLdh53RVnrFjGcDBGXw4DxPRSwkUDUKxC3r-tAoygUj1KnzP07ZaEe2Mo5aqhvlQAeenGA0iHVk1y409Ofh2Iuy_5uQZd85cCtMJpTryVEJA/s2048/new%20jumper%20with%20yellow%20coat.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="309" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEirAeq7N1NRFAQOBceb2ad0euBTZQ8yliSimpR10fUS_i2TO53rkprSIHZWeCwGV9I08hw7Urjeu_kLdh53RVnrFjGcDBGXw4DxPRSwkUDUKxC3r-tAoygUj1KnzP07ZaEe2Mo5aqhvlQAeenGA0iHVk1y409Ofh2Iuy_5uQZd85cCtMJpTryVEJA/w400-h309/new%20jumper%20with%20yellow%20coat.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Loving my new jumper</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We found our new dustbin at Leroy Merlin in Majadahonda. From there we walked to another Starbucks where I ordered a far too large Cappuccino. I came home with a funny tummy and could not face lunch. Was it the coffee? I had the runs and couldn't eat for the rest of the day. I slept fitfully. Today as I write, my stomach is still not ok. <div><br></br></div><div>It felt slightly better on <b>Friday</b> morning.  It was 1st March and we had to deal with the faulty washing machine - I can tell you we need two with all the guests we have - and do the shopping. I don't know why but after Eladio's fall on Monday, neither of us felt like going on our walk. They will resume though. </div><div><br></br></div><div>While we were out, I missed the funeral and burial of Alexei Navalny, aged just 47 and who needs no introduction. Finally last week the authorities returned his body to the family. It seemed they would interfere with or were trying to stop a public funeral. But, the crowds got the better of them and turned up outside even though only family was allowed inside the church. We heard most funeral parlours contacted wouldn't provide a hearse and I imagine the priest who officiated must have been very brave. Russian funerals are very long. Some of my cousins of Russian extraction who followed it online, commented "<i>the funeral was extremely fast. Apparently the priest and choir were pressured into making the service as fast as humanly possible</i>." But the government couldn't stop people watching online or the crowds attending outside, albeit from behind barriers, some chanting "no to war" and "we are with you" and even "Russia without Putin". The funeral took place under strict security at the Church of the Icon of Our Lady Quench My Sorrows which must have been Navalny's local church. Only one photo has emerged of the beautiful Orthodox ceremony where Navalny is laid  in an open coffin in line with the Russian Orthodox tradition.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXQPiStNyqE8W0EI0m9gT8IUbYMR77WtBY-7NW_MoAfxO2D6pPM4NoQAokvodTHRs3f-68J7wtmWOQm30XLnX_G3MOdv9w3hdydG9wpaid1PsfNrgcE6Mz895gE0srLXIysaOXd9vp8re5dLBdJ4wpiQAYvee5LM6F45oTDCYy5GkC9l-Uz34jEQ/s1349/Navalny.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgXQPiStNyqE8W0EI0m9gT8IUbYMR77WtBY-7NW_MoAfxO2D6pPM4NoQAokvodTHRs3f-68J7wtmWOQm30XLnX_G3MOdv9w3hdydG9wpaid1PsfNrgcE6Mz895gE0srLXIysaOXd9vp8re5dLBdJ4wpiQAYvee5LM6F45oTDCYy5GkC9l-Uz34jEQ/w320-h400/Navalny.jpg" width="320"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The funeral of Alexei Navalny this Friday at his church just outside Moscow</i></td></tr></tbody></table>From there the body was carried a few kilometres to the cemetery for a brief interment ceremony. The crowds followed. Present at the event were various Ambassadors from at least the USA and France. In other parts of Russia,  memorial events were carried out and quickly stopped by the government. <div><br></br></div><div>Alexei's wife, Yulia, who called him Lyosha  (Alexander can be shortened to Alyosha or simply Lyosha and of course Sasha)  posted a beautiful farewell to her husband of 26 years on her social media handles where she confessed she doesn't know how to live without him.  This is what she wrote: "<i>Lyosha, thank you for 26 years of happiness. Yes, even over the last three years of happiness. For love, for always supporting me, for making me laugh even from prison, for the fact that you always thought about me. I don't know how to live without you, but I will try to make you up there happy for me and proud of me. I don't know if I can handle it or not, but I will try. We will definitely meet one day. I have so many untold stories for you and I have so many songs saved for you on my phone, stupid and funny, in general, to be honest, terrible songs but they are about us, and I really wanted to let you listen to them, laugh and then hug me. Love you forever. Rest in peace"</i> . </div><div><br></br></div><div>Due to fears over reprisals I was very sad to hear that neither she nor their children could attend. All they could do was watch the funeral online.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Yulia has vowed to continue her husband's fight. I really hope she has the strength to do it. I found that very moving and I totally relate to her saying she doesn't know how to live without her husband. That's what I thought when Eladio fell on Monday morning. But I am lucky, he is OK and by my side. Let it be so to the end of our days. <br></br><div><br></br></div><div>Once home, it was time to unpack the shopping and have lunch. My stomach was still playing me up but I managed to eat. In the afternoon I had a sudden crave for carbs and went down to make a cup of tea and toast with butter. </div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Saturday</b> came and brought colder weather as well as much needed rain. It also brought snow, mainly in the north. There was sleet in Madrid. Olivia and the kids paid us an unexpected visit in the morning which was a pleasant surprise. But we had to part at 12.30 as were going to Madrid to have lunch with Eladio's brother and his wife, Toño and Dolores. We took Tana with us as she would be out for the day and stopped at Manacor for delicious cakes and biscuits to take with us. These days we never drive into Madrid by car as we always get fined. Thus we leave it at the free car park at a metro station about a 15 minute drive from home. From there we take the metro to near where they live. It's actually quite a doddle to get into the city that way; not that I am a great fan of walking underground on the metro because of the pollution. I always feel dirty afterwards. We were soon at their block of flats where we once lived. We moved there just after we married in August 1983 and lived there until 1988 when we moved to Boadilla. By then the girls were aged 3 and 4. I doubt they remember much about our flat in the centre of Madrid. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We were welcomed in by Toño and Dolores into their massive flat where they have lived for more than 40 years. It was at their flat that I met Eladio in the summer of 1980. As they say, the rest is history. It was good so see them. We had a quiet meal together and vowed we must see each other more often as, to quote Dolores, "time is flying". The three of them are 10 years older than me and talk about being old. I guess they are but they sort of include me in the equation. They did the same when they started talking about retirement when they were 50. I was 40 at the time and it was all a bit early. I refuse to see myself as "old", although, of course, I am getting there. Old age is bloody awful. I know that from witnessing the demise of both Eladio's mother and my father who died aged 99 and 102. It's all very well living to 100; the important thing is to do so in reasonable shape, with no dementia or mobility issues. Meanwhile, "carpe diem" my friends.</div><div><br></br></div><div>We left at around 5.45 and in under an hour were home. The house was quiet despite having 5 guests this weekend.I slept on and off and was woken up by a guest at 7 am who wanted to leave. He had parked inside the garage which I had told him not to do and there were 2 cars blocking his. When it was sorted, I got up and had breakfast. My "tummy" is feeling slightly better today. Today is <b>Sunday</b> and Oli and the kids are coming for lunch.</div><div><br></br></div><div>This next week I have 2 more dental appointments. If all goes well I will be finished by 14th March and then free to travel again. Whoopee. </div><div><br></br></div><div>I am now at the end of the tales of this week. I wish you all a happy Sunday wherever you are and whatever you are doing. Until next time,</div><div><br></br></div><div>Cheers Masha</div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br><div><br></br></div></div></div>
