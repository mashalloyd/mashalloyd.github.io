<div class="MsoNormal">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Hi
everyone, </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">This week has not been good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span>In fact it has been exhausting and very
worrying; very different from last Sunday when life went on as usual.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Now it has fallen all apart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>There is only one thing to report, my Father
is in hospital and our lives revolve around him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The house is empty, the dogs don’t know what
is going on and we spend the days and nights taking turns to be with my
Father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Eladio and I take turns at night
and the girls or Olga go in the afternoons. In Spain each patient is expected
to have someone to accompany him, day and night and that is what we do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We have turned into nurses over night, something
which for me was distressing and difficult at the beginning but is now becoming
easier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>As an acquaintance said on
Facebook, “do it with love and it will all come naturally”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>How right she is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thank you Tanya.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">You will know that my Father fell some six
weeks ago, just a few days after being in hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He complained that his left ankle and foot hurt
and the 4 doctors who saw him, including a prestigious traumatologist, all made
a wrong diagnosis and said he had a sprain and prescribed bandaging and paracetamol.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He did tell them all that it most hurt when
his left leg was lifted but they still all insisted he had a sprain which they
could see from the X-rays. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>However they
only took X-rays of his foot, not his leg or higher up, even though we insisted.
And because of the wrong diagnosis in those six weeks he was confined to a
wheel chair and terrible pain and dependent on us for his every movement, which
of course depressed him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We did our best
to look after him and feed him and cheer him up but I could not understand why
six weeks after the fall he was still in agony.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>What we didn’t know was that he was also losing blood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>No wonder he was so weak and listless. He was
monitored by his local GP, if you can call it monitoring, who told us that from
the blood test results she had seen he had lost a lot of hemoglobin and iron
and could be bleeding internally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She
thought the loss of blood came from the daily aspirin he was taking for his
heart and took him off it and prescribed iron tablets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She warned us that if we saw any blood in his
stools, to rush him to hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This
turned out to be a contradiction as apparently if you take iron tablets your
stools will always be black.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Tuesday afternoon, the day before Spain’s
national holiday on 12<sup>th</sup> October and the day before my trip to
Lithuania, fate was ironically on my Father’ side as we would finally find out
what was wrong with him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In the late
afternoon, Eladio saw the dreaded blood and rang the doctor who told us to ring
the equivalent of 999 (112 in Spain).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>The Emergency services immediately sent an ambulance and my poor
frightened Father was lifted in to it on a stretcher. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>It was his first time ever in an ambulance and
my third, I think.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Luckily I was able to
accompany him and Eladio followed behind in his car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We were taken to the Spanish national health
service <a href="http://www.madrid.org/cs/Satellite?pagename=HospitalFundacionHospitalAlcorcon/Page/HALC_home">hospital in Alcorcón</a> some 15km from home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He was in agony the whole way complaining
about the pain in his foot with every bump the ambulance made and I could do
nothing to help him, just look on with a broken heart.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We arrived at the hospital and were attended
immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had dreaded hours and
hours of waiting in the emergency unit but no, two young doctors came quite
soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In just five minutes they realised
what was wrong with him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The young South
American doctor asked my Father in perfect English “Sir, could you please lift
your right leg up (the good leg)” which he did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Then he said “Sir, could you please lift your left leg up (the bad leg)”
and my Father said he couldn’t.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The
doctor insisted: “Sir, why can’t you lift your left leg up?” and thereby came
the answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He couldn’t lift it up because
his hip was broken or that was what the doctor suspected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>His suspicions were confirmed with an X-ray
five minutes later. We could hardly believe what we were hearing. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Six weeks ago my Father had fallen and broken
his hip and none of the doctors had been able to diagnose or bother to diagnose
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The so-called prestigious traumatologist
at the Clínica 2001 in Majadahonda just took an X-ray of his foot, briefly
touched it and did not ask my Father the vital question if he could lift his
leg.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Later I asked the traumatologist at
the Hospital de Alcorcón, why the other doctors hadn’t realised and I think he
covered up for them by saying that if my Father had complained about pain in
his foot they wouldn’t have suspected it was his hip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I then asked why the pain was in his foot if
the fracture was in his hip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The answer
was simple, pain can manifest itself in another part of the body to the injury,
as often happens with back injuries, for example.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But surely traumatologists know that I
thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thank goodness the young South
American doctor, to whom I will always be grateful, asked that one simple
question which was the key to my Father’s well being.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Luck was also on our side on Tuesday in that we
knew a doctor at the hospital who pushed all the right buttons for things to
move fast and in the right direction for my Father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It turned out that Juan, the father of Rocío,
the girls’ best friend from St. Michael’s school, is the head anaesthetist at
the very same hospital where my Father was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Juan was travelling to Chicago the next day, but even so he rang all the
right people and got his team to take his place and be there for any assistance
we needed, including Teresa, a gentle lovely doctor who helped us enormously
throughout.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>Luck was not on our side that first night which I spent with my Father in the Emergency Unit.  I had just a hard chair to sit on and needless to say neither of us got a wink of sleep. That night is better forgotten.</span><br></br>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span> </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">So now we knew he had a broken hip which would
have to be operated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However my Father
was a high risk patient because of his age and weak health caused by the blood
loss.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>There was an option not to operate
but that would have meant never walking again and forever living in pain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We decided then and there that he was to have
the operation. The doctors were not sure whether the blood loss came from the
hip fracture or from another cause. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>So
first they had to wash out his stomach and then subject him to an endoscopy,
the latter an unpleasant test which when we read the consent form, made us
think twice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thankfully Juan was always
there to advise us on the phone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
cannot thank him enough. No internal bleeding was evident from either procedure
so the next day, Thursday, they went ahead with the high risk operation of a
replacement hip. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Teresa and the Cristina, her delightful young colleague
from Juan’s team of anaesthetists let me in to the ante theatre where I was
able to see my Father before his operation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>He was going to have a lumbar anesthetic rather than a general anesthetic
which was a lot less dangerous for someone his age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Some two hours later Diego, the
traumatologist who had operated him, told us the operation had been a great
success.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We were so happy!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Teresa then let us see him in the reanimation
room (if that’s what it’s called in English hospitals) and he was amazing, he
was all there, completely aware of what was going on and not particularly
distressed or worried.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was so proud of
him.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Well that was last Thursday and today is
Sunday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He is slowly getting stronger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>All my
friends and family have been a great support.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I hesitated about reporting his progress on Facebook but now I’m glad I
did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>There have been so many wonderful
comments and I read them all to him and he is amazed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thanks my friends. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Fátima came to see him last night and Julio
came this morning, Pili and Dolores ring nearly every day and Jackqueline is
praying for him as are some more of my friends. As I said on Facebook, it’s
good to have religious friends in these times, hahaha. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I made a pact with Jacky, I would feed him
with food made lovingly at home and she would pray.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Jackqueline has prayed at every stage and
every stage has been a success. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I’m so
impressed with her results that I have now asked her to pray for him to walk
again and have a good health and mind and live to at least 102.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She has agreed but is not too sure whether
 102 is God’s providence or not! Caring for Grandpa after such a big
operation is like reviving a wilting plant, some sun, some water and most of
all loving care.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">As the hospital food is not appetising and he is not very hungry, I decided on the second day to bring him his food from home and bring him the food he likes best. So here I am thinking most of the day what I am
going to make to take him for his next meal, to whet his appetite and to make
him stronger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Then when he eats it all,
I feel like clapping my hands with joy and happiness as my tactics are
working.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Our main occupation now is for
him to eat and to do the special exercises from his bed in preparation for
getting out of bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Yes, Grandpa will
get stronger, the pain will go, he will take his first steps on a zimmer frame
and he will come home and will have quality of life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Then we’ll take it from it there, slowly but
surely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>His main objective is to go on
the weekly food shopping outing with Eladio where they both enjoy a glass of
white wine and a tapa at the Cafetería Río.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>You see, he doesn’t ask for much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Whilst my Father has been in the hospital I
haven’t really followed the news, as my thoughts are really only with him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  There really are no other stories to tell this week.  </span>I have realised however just how warm the
weather continues to be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We still go
about in summer clothes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Before my
Father went into hospital on Tuesday afternoon, believe it or not both Olivia
and I swam in our very cold pool.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We
enjoyed the afternoons with him there, as did our dear dogs which are now a
little abandoned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I took this photo of
Elsa on Monday who this week reached the grand old age of 5 months, a mere
puppy but now getting bigger and bigger as you can see from the photo below.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"> If my Father hadn’t been admitted to hospital,
this week I would have told you more about the lunch with my ex Nokia girl
friends on Monday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The lunch was called
for by Susana to celebrate her new job but she cancelled at the last minute, as
did Fátima.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So Jill, Ana, Zenaida and I
arrived at the restaurant Susana had told us the lunch was to be, a place called
Coquerel in Majadahonda to find it was closed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>In the end, rather cross with Susana, we went to a Chinese place nearby
and had a cheap menu of the day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I would also have told you about my exciting
trip to Vilnius in Lithuania on Wednesday for the Communications team meeting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But of course I had to cancel it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I love travelling but even if I had been
going to the moon, I would have cancelled as I could not miss being with my
Father at such traumatic times for him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">And that my friends, is the story of how our
lives turned upside down in just a week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>As I finish writing my thoughts are with my Father and Eladio in ward
C2, room 222 at the Hospital Universitario Fundación Alcorcón.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Eladio will be in the reclining chair by the
window and my Father in his hospital bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>They occupy one half of the room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>The other half is occupied by another patient, Juan in his late 80s’ who
snores so loud at night I can’t sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Rosa, his daughter spends every night with him and we have become good
friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Illness tends to unite.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I wish them all a good night as I wish you
too.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Cheers my friends, till next week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
