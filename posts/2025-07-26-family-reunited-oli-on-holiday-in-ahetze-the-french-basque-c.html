We were going to be taking part in our first family therapy session with Suzy at the outpatient hospital but first we had to go and fill the Mini with brake oil. I dressed up for the occasion which may seem silly but I don't often have the opportunity and wanted to look nice for Suzy at the therapy session.

It's not really my style but I was encouraged by Amanda who thought it was lovely. With my yellow and orange leather bag and yellow espadrilles I was very colour coordinated and felt good.</p><p>While we were out and about, Oli and family were on their way to the French Basque Country to a town called Ahetze. Not far from Biarritz and Saint Jean de Luz, they stayed at an&nbsp; Airbnb run by hosts, a bit like us. Unfortunately though they weren't allowed to use the kitchen which was reserved for the family. This is <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/918170900291953547?viralityEntryPoint=1&amp;s=76&amp;source_impression_id=p3_1753526011_P35piXedM6vy-LEH">it</a>.&nbsp; And here are the children just after they arrived and probably after their first bathe in the pool.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisyi64FXfI-wl9m1DjAY53oioXf5Wvnb2wiRgKxe2W1QaYvDJbpCEs7HQXQZt4Y0IufsUbuGOo0J1Y0cQAFS98RIGIJc5XwrUr5ULWsc9TFvB4RizdOLWmRUFDvFNMqyNKByr6yicuBhZVklNfAjuDX5z4AZTxR9SO1uHOlHtRSmRO8k_h0V1-tw/s1599/IMG-20250721-WA0019.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="899" data-original-width="1599" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisyi64FXfI-wl9m1DjAY53oioXf5Wvnb2wiRgKxe2W1QaYvDJbpCEs7HQXQZt4Y0IufsUbuGOo0J1Y0cQAFS98RIGIJc5XwrUr5ULWsc9TFvB4RizdOLWmRUFDvFNMqyNKByr6yicuBhZVklNfAjuDX5z4AZTxR9SO1uHOlHtRSmRO8k_h0V1-tw/w400-h225/IMG-20250721-WA0019.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Miguel and the kids at their Airbnb in Ahetze in the French Basque Country when they arrived on Monday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>I knew Olivia would be in her element as she has been dying to practice her French which she has been studying after work for the last two years. Bravo Darling.<div><br /></div><div>Meanwhile we got to the hospital on time to meet some of Suzy's companions and by 12.20 we were sitting in a circle in a big room with them, their families and the therapists; the nurse, the psychologist, the occupational therapist and the psychiatrist. Suzy has been going for a few weeks now and will continue in September. I'm not sure what I got out of the session but it was good to see the patients, their families and the therapists. I was happy to be part of it but wish it had been a bit more structured. It was a bit like Quakers' meeting, the session is not guided, people just talk spontaneously.</div><div><br /></div><div>We came home together in two cars and by then my latest guest, Tomoko and her toddler son Sandy had arrived. She is Japanese and lives in Hawaii. I wonder how far she lives from Pearl Harbour but I didn't ask her. Later we saw her 12 year old daughter who had come to study Spanish. Tomoko who left yesterday was a great guest. I mustn't forget to tell you she brought us the most delicious honey roasted macadamia nuts from Hawaii, the best I have ever tasted.</div><div><br /></div><div>In the afternoon Amanda and I resumed our FaceTime sessions. We hand't spoken since they left Spain on 6th July. She was in fine fettle and it was good to catch up. She is my therapy and I am hers.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Later I joined Suzy by the pool and we had a long talk. She was showing signs of acute depression. So far on the medication she is taking for her bipolar condition, she had improved but she seems rock bottom to me now. I encouraged her to talk to the psychiatrist and they may have to change the medication but of course it's holiday time in Spain and a difficult time to do that. God bless her. On the bright side we got in touch with the Madrid Bipolar Association which sounds good and we will be in touch again in September. I think she needs intensive one to one therapy not generalised group therapy where one size does not fit all. That night I finished the Churchill film - In his darkest Hour - and sent her the quote at the end from him. He too had his dark moments. This is it: "<i>Success is not final, failure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts</i>" and continue she must. I know she will get through this but she is in the middle of the journey and it's the hardest part.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Tuesday</b> came and we had a coffee date with our friends Roberto and MariCarmen whom we hadn't seen since the middle of June. It's always great to catch up with them and another excuse to dress up to go out.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>On Tuesday Oli and family were at the Grand Plage in St. Jean de Luz, their only sunny day, I should add. I love that beach and it's one of the best for kids in the area as the waves are not too strong. Here is a photo she sent me and below a video.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh98y7iXePLUKSccVQ9NjLsXE6PEESgeOVbSI-D32TjabTO2J-gModA5JVbfbR6QUdz9yvhat-Kui0tj4u9CQiDhQCHG04tIp1cVt1uJRFqVJLoIqIFJxq6aTcLGq2FUjOkJnuIlpAzck_odQPWsUL85-eylw7t6gd7KvU2JPFRDTni3s_bO34mCw/s1599/IMG-20250722-WA0003.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1599" data-original-width="899" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh98y7iXePLUKSccVQ9NjLsXE6PEESgeOVbSI-D32TjabTO2J-gModA5JVbfbR6QUdz9yvhat-Kui0tj4u9CQiDhQCHG04tIp1cVt1uJRFqVJLoIqIFJxq6aTcLGq2FUjOkJnuIlpAzck_odQPWsUL85-eylw7t6gd7KvU2JPFRDTni3s_bO34mCw/w225-h400/IMG-20250722-WA0003.jpg" width="225" /></a></div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen='allowfullscreen' webkitallowfullscreen='webkitallowfullscreen' mozallowfullscreen='mozallowfullscreen' width='320' height='266' src='https://www.blogger.com/video.g?token=AD6v5dx_Z4TpaAYmb8ex0sXsj7W2U98KF8-gNylRn7QJ7UGX5XiIkmBlUq9AMjG9VaebDxP76Pa4C1MQFtY' class='b-hbp-video b-uploaded' frameborder='0'></iframe></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Oli and family at the Grand Plage in St. Jean de Luz on Tuesday</i></div><div>Suzy and I were planning dinner for Julio, our friend, who was coming the next day. But it wasn't to be. Sadly his father, Julio Navio Romero, died aged 93 that morning. His carer, Lucy, was also my father's carer and she has now been present at both their deaths. I was so sad for my friend and his family, especially his mother who is now a widower. We promised to see him at the Funeral Parlour the next day.</div><div><br /></div><div>It was on Tuesday too that our internet stopped working. I did the usual which was to switch the router off and on but it didn't come back. There began my odyssey with our provider Movistar. They told me the problem was with our router, that they would try to fix it remotely and if that didn't work a technician would come. Five minutes later it was back but with a weak signal. I was worried about my Japanese guest who had an American phone so was relieved it was back. But not for long. A technician came the next day, fixed something with the router and then went into to the street to look at the fibre connection. He came back saying it was faulty and needed repairing. That was on Thursday and since then we have been without internet at home and there is no sign of anyone coming to fix the connection. You can imagine I have bombarded Movistar left right and centre but it's still not fixed. It must be affecting more homes and I don't understand why they are leaving it so long. Damn!</div><div><br /></div><div>Things only got worse that night. My English guests from Liverpool, Danny and family who were checking into our apartment at Santa Pola were arriving that night and would be received by Mar the key holder. It was their first trip abroad and they were very excited. Well, guess what happened? Upon arrival 2 bloody flying cockroaches were on the wall. Imagine their impression. I have never seen one of those awful creatures in that flat in my life. However, my neighbour, Lucy, told me they were everywhere due to the extreme heat in the area. Thankfully they got rid of them and never saw another one again.&nbsp; A week before I had a guest who complained of bed bugs which was beyond belief. When the cleaner went she said there was not a trace of them. I knew we didn't have them but try explaining that to an angry guest. I am still waiting for a nasty review. Those are the lows of renting property on Airbnb and Booking as a host. And all the troubles fall on my shoulders. I just wish my skin was a bit thicker as issues like these have me running round in circles trying to fix the problems.&nbsp; Thus, of course, I have been sleeping very badly again recently - nearly always actually:-(</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Wednesday</b> came and I dressed up to go to the Funeral Parlour on the horrid Madrid circle road, the notorious M30. I wore this outfit which I was a bit iffy about but both my girls loved it.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4KoJZzjcoAhqK3ySOXh_R2qBnisgtEYCgV_u-9nX5WiI_HwkYY6QMxG7ZlVIeFvpDZRLsAoZQpFR-A0sI4U2dNw19hqSvseb3nQ0cNAeH82bUWoCQc9KBvlz1baC1KMRYpy0UE6G6LoMNW-IL79BxTCGlTDFNDCYAATJHprY5wg5VxIGkmsXElA/s2981/20250723_092143.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="2981" data-original-width="1480" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4KoJZzjcoAhqK3ySOXh_R2qBnisgtEYCgV_u-9nX5WiI_HwkYY6QMxG7ZlVIeFvpDZRLsAoZQpFR-A0sI4U2dNw19hqSvseb3nQ0cNAeH82bUWoCQc9KBvlz1baC1KMRYpy0UE6G6LoMNW-IL79BxTCGlTDFNDCYAATJHprY5wg5VxIGkmsXElA/w199-h400/20250723_092143.jpg" width="199" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The new look I wore to the funeral parlour for Julio's father's death on Wednesday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>In Spain when someone dies, nearly everyone is taken to a funeral parlour (tanatorio) where people come to comfort the family. I find it very dull and not at all cheerful. There is no wake as such nor is there an event to celebrate the person's life. There is often a funeral that is held weeks later but again, only words from a boring Catholic priest. I far prefer the British way and I do not ever want to be taken to a Tanatorio. But it was good to see Julio and to comfort him and to meet his sister, Teresa. We stayed for an hour and a half and then left to tackle the M30 to drive home and do the shopping.&nbsp; Our morning was packed.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Oli and co, meanwhile were at the biggest adventure park in France.

I think they enjoyed themselves as much as they could of course.<div><br /></div><div>I had planned to make a water melon gazpacho for the dinner that Julio didn't come to, so I made it for us instead and we had it for dinner. Suzy did the toppings: chopped up ham, boiled eggs, red peppers, spring onion and croutons. The main ingredients of the gazpacho were of course tomatoes, green pepper, garlic, bread, olive oil and this time both water melon and some strawberries.

On my way there I spied a rather nice Chinese boutique. Spain is full of little clothes shops run by Chinese and you can get some really good stuff. I got a lovely culotte in blue with white embroidery and a white t-shirt with the words "life is good". It is, despite everything.<div><br /></div><div>I told Suzy about the shop and offered to take her to see if anything would take her fancy. We hadn't done any retail therapy together for a long time and our session on Thursday afternoon made her happy. Here is just one of the outfits she got and she looks lovely in it and in all the others. It was lovely to see a smile on her face.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigK2eE2Kx4UpdaG_eO-ddQHfv9gTXtqin9jtGtQuHcNCuYLCfb8hk09xpnsBWVUEROtzGppExXmVLvTccyxzwo-3EpyJGBOeMCtadzu7Bvm4G6vNK9hiWohVJgYKFkZY4L_9rSQW8Fgw-oUlygl8DsPolDoJFlzBudAOjwG6mz6U93P9oIB4Pt5Q/s3710/20250724_190315.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="3710" data-original-width="1848" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigK2eE2Kx4UpdaG_eO-ddQHfv9gTXtqin9jtGtQuHcNCuYLCfb8hk09xpnsBWVUEROtzGppExXmVLvTccyxzwo-3EpyJGBOeMCtadzu7Bvm4G6vNK9hiWohVJgYKFkZY4L_9rSQW8Fgw-oUlygl8DsPolDoJFlzBudAOjwG6mz6U93P9oIB4Pt5Q/w199-h400/20250724_190315.jpg" width="199" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A moment during retail therapy with Suzy on Thursday afternoon</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div>Our day ended with a glass of white Rueda wine by Marques de Riscal with some of the delicious Hawaiian macadamia nuts. I must also mention that on Thursday I caught up with Kathy and Phil in a FaceTime call just before Suzy and I went shopping. We had missed each other in France so hope to see them here in Spain in September.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Friday</b> dawned and we left for Montrondo around 10.15. We stopped for coffee at Villacastin and then for a sort of lunch at Palacio de Bornos in Rueda. There we feasted on local wine, bread and ham and cheese and peppers for Suzy. The pièce de resistance was some of their chocolate which we always buy. Here are some photos of our time at Bornos, one of my happy places as I'm sure you know.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9OnvEJADDarX5_bY08wtzv14kegRd99pjlROHhT1i8fiNaopHqeoEtxSxbhwaFjr_IWAK60JCJvci2XoGzsPPvRP55_qYH7BQ5Rzjhx03FSMz-8lhdSEn1p9ak2fut8tk-bts8Da8-KyskkQLOLFEkphbPLiN2xrD9ZUQgAJjht71Gp5VsM_ccA/s4000/20250725_130107.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1848" data-original-width="4000" height="185" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9OnvEJADDarX5_bY08wtzv14kegRd99pjlROHhT1i8fiNaopHqeoEtxSxbhwaFjr_IWAK60JCJvci2XoGzsPPvRP55_qYH7BQ5Rzjhx03FSMz-8lhdSEn1p9ak2fut8tk-bts8Da8-KyskkQLOLFEkphbPLiN2xrD9ZUQgAJjht71Gp5VsM_ccA/w400-h185/20250725_130107.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidMVrPnrqiikaqCSxuxgJfxsGhJIqqmx5Ix7-ggTbs34qZBaH3OCkvlbcVL3CPU4IXwArAhBOa8kQB38hHiNKaMiy7YqH_U7F4POWoqTY2UnComUZK5XipN7OMhe7U80UGQLoi3Ufk-k8RxUoha_6wlVLTj9c0f_AW1-nhEQnxPkDFQ9axY9ROGw/s4000/20250725_131602.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1848" data-original-width="4000" height="185" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidMVrPnrqiikaqCSxuxgJfxsGhJIqqmx5Ix7-ggTbs34qZBaH3OCkvlbcVL3CPU4IXwArAhBOa8kQB38hHiNKaMiy7YqH_U7F4POWoqTY2UnComUZK5XipN7OMhe7U80UGQLoi3Ufk-k8RxUoha_6wlVLTj9c0f_AW1-nhEQnxPkDFQ9axY9ROGw/w400-h185/20250725_131602.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Pit stop on the way to Montrondo for an early lunch at one of our happy places, the winery Palacio de Bornos in Rueda&nbsp;</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div>We arrived to 28ºc in Montrondo and were greeted by Eladio's sister, Pili and her grandson Andrés. It was a very sweet and emotional reunion for Suzy and Pili who she hadn't seen for possibly 7 years. Later she was reunited with Eladio's other sister, Adela and his brother Isidro. She was happy to see them all if a little anxious.&nbsp; &nbsp;We all had coffee at Pili's and caught up on each other's lives.&nbsp; That was after settling in of course. It was good to be back in quiet and beautiful and not so hot Montrondo.</div><div><br /></div><div>I slept not too badly that night but was up at 6.45 on Saturday morning. Eladio and his brothers had tried to remove a huge desk from the top floor spare room to give space to Juliet and Elliot when they come so that Suzy can have her room to her own.&nbsp; I washed sheets from when Andy and Amanda were here and made up Oli and Miguel's bed. Only then could I treat myself to a coffee at the grumpy man's bar in Senra. Suzy joined me and we had our coffee in peace surrounded by the beautiful mountains.&nbsp;</div><div><div><br /></div><div>It was a quiet day but in the afternoon José Antonio and family arrived from their holiday in Galicia.&nbsp; They brought most of their brood - in all they are 14 and I wouldn't want to be in Dolores' shoes when it comes to feeding everyone three times a day! It was their sons Miguel and&nbsp; Juan who helped Eladio and Isidro to bring down the huge desk and store it somewhere for future use. I was sad to see it go as it was at that desk that I wrote a lot of my father's book.&nbsp;<br /><div><br /></div><div>In much need of exercise Suzy and I had agreed to go on an evening walk at 7, an hour before dinner and I had to drag Eladio away from his brothers and sisters to join us as he needed a walk too as did little Pippa. As usual we went along the old path to Murias and when we got to God's rock (la peña de Dios), the half way mark between Montrondo and Murias, I got Suzy to take a picture for today's blog post. Later I took one of her with Pips by the fountain. Here they are together.</div></div></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEip8-FmpK4kuLa3yZOl1_B5M2PM4JsdNa2d_eajJXV7aV9EMdO0zfmgqDg2kA7ob2qe8P51-oRDLdmGQW5ykyXNvkZFvuPKNAjj0LAwt8Jmt6N_QcEwaLL6YpkeM29br9uciIOQNlA0pTxsT2cBfAHDOh_Dnwal3Vf9oNH71G4TPhJC_4nqrAXsXg/s3278/20250726_200235.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="3278" data-original-width="1830" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEip8-FmpK4kuLa3yZOl1_B5M2PM4JsdNa2d_eajJXV7aV9EMdO0zfmgqDg2kA7ob2qe8P51-oRDLdmGQW5ykyXNvkZFvuPKNAjj0LAwt8Jmt6N_QcEwaLL6YpkeM29br9uciIOQNlA0pTxsT2cBfAHDOh_Dnwal3Vf9oNH71G4TPhJC_4nqrAXsXg/w224-h400/20250726_200235.jpg" width="224" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Suzy with Pips drinking water on our walk back home yesterday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>There are lots of people in the village now, who, like us, have roots here and come on holiday. We met a big group by "Los Palacios" and chatted which was a lot of fun. One of the women had been Eladio's pupil at the Gran Capitán school where he taught&nbsp; over 40 years ago!<div><br /></div><div>The walk did the four of us much good and we shall be going again today. We have no plans today, other than chilling around the house and garden&nbsp; in the company of part of Eladio's huge family - he is the eldest of 6.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>So my friends, this is it for this week. There is no mention of any news as we have been taking a break. However, the news from Gaza is in my mind as it is in many people's. The Israelis are slowly starving the population. They are suffering genocide from the very people who should have learned from theirs. That's it, I've said it. On that horrible note, may I leave you to enjoy your day until next Sunday,</div><div><br /></div><div>Cheers Masha<br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
