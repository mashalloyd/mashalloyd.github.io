<span style="text-align: justify;">Good morning all. How are you doing? Well, in general I have had a better week than last. Read on to find out more.</span><br></br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Last Sunday was a beautiful sunny day. Finally I got to see our "mystery guest", Julia, from the Canaries who I hadn't seen at all during her stay. What a lovely girl she is. In fact nearly all our guests are lovely,  She is doing a masters' degree in something to do with physiotherapy, about pain management - I could do with her help hahahaha - and no doubt she will come again. Her mother later sent a glowing 5 star review, saying I was a fantastic hostess and that the house was magnificent. Reviews like that make it all worthwhile. I can hardly believe I have now been an Airbnb host for 3 whole years, since I lost my job with Yoigo after the company was bought up. There you have it, reinventing myself after years of corporate life. I rather enjoy it but I also love it when guests go and we have the house to ourselves hahaha. Yes, I love it, but I have to say I wouldn't do it if we didn't need the financial help to upkeep our sprawling expensive house.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
We had the sprawling house to ourselves all day as the girls didn't come for lunch. I had made a huge quantity of spag bol (spaghetti bolognese) and they only told me at the last minute they wouldn't be coming. That meant we, well not me as I am on a diet, would be having leftovers for a few days hahahaha.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I finally returned to correcting the transcriptions of my mother's tapes and that day saw me finish the 19 page transcription of the second document. There are 11 documents and it's uphill work. There is lots I am learning but also lots I had heard before. I only wish she would have narrated her story chronologically as it's all up and down and difficult to get her story straight. If only she were here to ask. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Against my doctor's prescription, I went on a walk again that afternoon. Well, I had shortened them a bit from 1h 20 minutes to 1 hour approximately. I would be seeing a rehabilitation doctor (is that what they are called?) on Monday before starting the 10 sessions of physiotherapy so would consult him or her about the walking. I was crossing my fingers it would be ok as I cannot envisage my life without our walks.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I spent more time with Churchill that day too before dinner. I am reading his biography which is exciting but I haven't got to the part about WW2 for which he is most famous and the politics of the early part of the 19th century are a bit confusing and less interesting. I kept thinking that when my father was a young man, the great statesman was his Prime Minister! Wow, what a character and what a man. There has never been anyone like him ever again in the UK or anywhere.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Dinner was a small prawn salad - we love prawns - before more of the news on our big screen TV in bed after which we watched Jordi Evole's new programme about life in prison. It was quite depressing. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I didn't sleep too badly, waking up early as usual to a message on Airbnb from a woman probably from the US who was looking to book our house for Easter. Thus I got up to answer and went down to have breakfast. Lucy had beaten me to it and already fed the dogs.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Monday 17th February was the day Elliot turned 5 months old. Gosh, already 5 months old! Soon he will be eating proper food or rather weened slowly to puré like stuff beginning with things such as apples, pears and bananas. No doubt he will love it as if you think about it breast milk doesn't taste of much. On Sunday morning Oli sent me a lovely photo of him asleep in her bed - he is averse to his cot and only willing to sleep with his parents. They will have to find a way to ween him off that too I think. </div>

I got another one from Suzy on his 5th month anniversary. Oli had gone to Yoga and Suzy was babysitting. She was proud to tell me she had sung him to sleep. That's just what I used to do with my girls when they were babies and now they are doing the same. Oli told me recently that she remembered me singing to her at night but didn't like it  as she knew it was a sign I would leave her (clever girl) hahahaha. Anyway, here he is and looking like a kiwi, in his kiwi baby grow our cousin Katty sent from New Zealand in a huge parcel of clothes for Elliot. God bless the little boy.<br></br>

There are no words to describe what having him in our life means. Only if you are a grandparent will you understand me. Before he was born I didn't really know what to expect. As Suzy said after he was born: "I didn't know this feeling until you came along". He brings so much joy to our lives and happiness and is a huge addition to our lovely family.<br></br>
<br></br>
It wasn't only Elliot's day, it was also the 5th anniversary of Pippa, our miniature chocolate dachshund's arrival. She came to our home on 15th February 2015 while I was still recovering from the operation on my broken leg. Oh what joy to receive such a wonderful little puppy. Here she is the day she arrived.</div>

Because she is a miniature dachshund it's as if she is an eternal puppy. I fell in love with her as soon as I saw her and it was mutual. She latched on to me immediately as her reference person and is a bit like my shadow. Apparently that is a trait of dachshunds who are very territorial. If I'm away, Eladio becomes her reference person and if he's away, the girls or Lucy. Elsa, our lab, is also important in her life, more so than Norah our beagle who I suspect is  a bit jealous of her. Elsa is like a second mother to her, after me hahahaha.<br></br>

She brought out all the maternal instincts in me. I had never had a creature who loved me so much and the feeling is mutual. She is the most special dog we have ever had and we have had our share. Talk about loyalty and unconditional love. That sums her up a bit. I just wish she would be more trusting of other people. I have countless photos of her with me and the one below is one  I especially love. It was taken at Christmas in 2018 and is the photo I chose for the back of my father's book as I was determined for her to be in it because she is so important in my life.<br></br>

Pippa of course had no idea it was her anniversary and behaved as normal, following me around the house all the time. When I sit at my PC working she lies on her blanket on the red sofa in our study. If I get up to go somewhere, she gets up too and follows me. She even follows me to the bathroom and the shower, hahaha. A bit averse to water, as some dogs are, she doesn't mind me bathing her, except for her head, and let's me do anything to her without complaining as she has total confidence I will never ever hurt her. Bless the lovely creature. I am such a dog and animal person. I'm not sure where I got that from as neither of my parents were and as a child I was never allowed a pet. I got my revenge though when I got married and am blessed that Eladio is an animal person too. Our lives would not be the same without our dogs, especially Pippa.<br></br>
<br></br>
It was a quiet morning. I worked and then spent some time with Eladio's PC and on the phone to the Microsoft support people as I had an issue with his account. They were very efficient and even remotely accessed his computer to solve it. Thanks guys! Lunch was a mixture of leftovers and then time for the news. I had an appointment at 4.30 to see the rehabilitation doctor after my bout of sciatica.  I had to see her before having the physiotherapy I had been prescribed. The pain from the sciatica had gone by the time I saw the doctor. It would have been much better if I had seen her during the bout rather than once it was over. In any case I was glad to hear a different opinion from my alarmist Venezuelan doctor who had called my condition "severe".  She didn't seem to think it was that serious and likened arthritis to having wrinkles, i.e. age, hahaha. On the subject of exercise, I was delighted to hear from her that there is no problem going on walks and I can walk to my heart's content. I may have misunderstood when I went to A&E about the walks as she explained that no walking is when I am in pain. I have yet to hear from the physiotherapists for the sessions which she explained will be exercises to strengthen my back. I had hoped for massages but never mind.<br></br>
<br></br>
My visit to the doctor cheered me up enormously and I came home to go out again this time with Eladio on our walk. We had cut it shorter in recent days and now we could go on our long one which takes just over 1h and 20 minutes.  I was in need of the endorphins.<br></br>
<br></br>
The girls were back for dinner and to stay the night and of course little Elliot came along too. We had a family dinner together and I got Lucy to make us "tortilla". The day ended with me helping Oli bathe our little tot, time with him and the girls and then time in bed watching a new series (Blacklist) on Netflix. We must have switched off the light before midnight. I slept quite well and was up the next morning at the reasonable hour of 7 am.<br></br>
<br></br>
Soon Elliot and Oli came down to interrupt me on my PC and what a lovely interruption it was. Whenever they come down in the morning to find me in our study, I take him to see his great grandfather who is equally delighted to see him. Dear little Elliot.<br></br>
<br></br>
They were going to Valencia that day to be with their partner and father, Miguel, who was working a continuous stint of two weeks for TVE there. Eladio would take them to the station to take the AVE (fast speed train) and we all helped Oli to get ready to go which with a baby is an awful lot of things hahahaha. How Oli's life has changed but oh how well she had adapted to becoming a loving mother. I admire the way she taken to motherhood so naturally. She also strives to keep a normal life by taking her little baby with her everywhere. Later she sent us a photo of her on the train with little Elliot.<br></br>

It's just a 2 hour ride, an hour shorter than by car and Miguel, her partner, was there to pick them up at the station. He had missed them, especially little Elliot and was happy to be reunited with his son as you can see from the huge big smile on his face on another photo Oli sent us.<br></br>

Meanwhile, I went to do some emergency shopping for lunch, reserving the big weekly shopping expedition for the next day, Wednesday. We hardly Suzy that day as her lessons finished after our lunch and then she was  out again to give face to face lessons to her deaf student Olga and would be staying the night at her friend Elena's.<br></br>
<br></br>
The day went by as  normal for these days. The girls had decided to meet up in Santa Pola this weekend. We had sort of thought of going too but as the apartment would be occupied we decided that on Thursday we would come to Montrondo instead for a week or so as the weather forecast was excellent. We decided that on our walk in the sun in the afternoon.<br></br>
<br></br>
While we were on our walk, a new and repeat guest arrived, Adrian. I hadn't met him the last time he came so was a little surprised to meet a tattooed chap with lots of gold piercing including thick gold rings hanging from his nostrils!!! He is from Coin in Cádiz and has an equally thick Andalusian accent. But appearances can be deceiving and he is a nice chap. I may be a bit old fashioned and don't like tattoos or piercing although they are much in vogue for the new generations hahahaha, including my girls. Thankfully they don't have any rings sticking out of their nostrils hahahahha.<br></br>
<br></br>
Dinner was the tortilla leftovers with some runner beans over which we watched the news on my trusted iPad. Locally it was all about demonstrations and strikes, mainly from agricultural workers who claim they sell their produce nearly at a loss and and are demanding more fair play in the supply chain. From what I have understood, the main problem is the high taxes they pay. Let's see how the government react to this new movement, a little similar to the French "gilets jaunes". There was more on Coronavirus too and when that night I got a request from a Chinese man to come with his partner the following night I was a little afraid I have to admit. However, he said that they had been in the US for the last month. In the end I accepted the reservation but later he cancelled and in a way I felt relieved.<br></br>
<br></br>
That night after the news we watched a film by the director Alejandro Amenabar called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sea_Inside%20%20%202004">Mar Adentro" (The Sea Inside)</a> released in 2015. With focus in the news these days about the new law for euthanasia, the protagonist, the real life, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_Sampedro">Ramón Sampedro</a>'s case was what really brought the issue to light in this country. Born in 1943 in a fishing village in rural Galicia, at the age of 25, he dived into the sea miscalculating the depth of the water and his head struck the sand below and he broke his neck. In one minute he went from being an able bodied young man to a quadriplegic. He lived prostrate in his bed in the home of his brother, being looked after by the family, his sister-in-law mainly and nephew. He was told he would die quite soon after the injuries but that did not happen. Slowly he began to campaign for the right to end his life, something he could not do on his own as he was completely paralysed from his neck down. He became a household name, appearing on many programmes. He lost court cases to take his life legally. So, in 1998, nearly 30 years after his accident and with the help of a chain of friends, he took his own life, sipping cyanide with a straw, his own death being taped. In the tape he asks for the anonymous friends not to be charged for their help in his death as he said it was his own decision taken by his head and that the friends only lent their hands. In his words, he had a head with a dead body attached to it and did not want to live like that.<br></br>

I had seen the film when it came out. It won an Oscar for best foreign film and I am not surprised as it is a very moving film and story. If you haven't seen it and have the stomach to watch it, I highly recommend it.<br></br>
<br></br>
I couldn't sleep much after that and took 2 sleeping tablets. Even so I was up early on Wednesday morning, at about 6.30. Wednesday was one of the highlights of this week as amazingly we went out to the cinema, something we haven't done for donkey's years.<br></br>
<br></br>
I love that expression don't you. Well, amazingly too, that day I came across my old vocabulary book I had bought in Spain in 1978 in my year in Madrid as part of my degree at Nottingham University. I remember buying this lovely little green bound booklet from El Corte Inglés. I took it everywhere with me, jotting down any new expression or word I didn't know. I had a quick look and it is full of expressions and swear words as well as everyday words. What a find. What memories. I do remember that practice of mine being essential to my learning the language of Cervantes to the best of my abilities. I did it with Portuguese too later on but never learned the language as well. This is just one page of it.<br></br>

Eladio and I had a good laugh when I read out some of the more salacious expressions hahaha.<br></br>
<br></br>
On the topic of learning languages, of course my parent and my brother were born polyglots, unlike me who had to slave at it. On the subject of learning English, my mother's 6th language, I was disgusted, just as she would have been, at the new immigration law proposed by the British government and announced that day. Basically it will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/18/uk-to-close-door-to-non-english-speakers-and-unskilled-workers?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Gmail">close the doors to non English speakers and unskilled workers</a> which was exactly my mother's position when she arrived in England. <span style="background-color: white; color: #1c1e21; font-family: &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">My mother, a penniless Russian princess, arrived in Londom 1945 after the war as a refugee. She knew 5 languages and wanted to learn English which she learned very quickly. She could not go back to her home country which had been taken over by the communists. As a refugee she had to do menial work for 2 years before being allowed residency. So she cleaned in people's houses and at Middlesex Hospital. When the 2 years were up, the BBC took her on as a presenter for their Russian service. She eventually settled down in her adopted country and swore allegiance to the Queen when she got her citizenship. She married an Englishman, my father, and they lived happily ever after. She became a staunch anglofile and considered England her home. She died in 1999 and would be disgusted with the news above. I was both shocked and angry at the news. Aren't you? And, I am ashamed of my country. My mother arrived without a penny nor a word of English, yet she went on to become a teacher at Leeds University and if she hadn't been allowed in I would never have been born. Oh how I hate what is becoming of my mother's adopted and my birth country. </span><br></br>
<br></br>
My mother loved the Queen and as a born Brit, I do too. It has been instilled in me. Well that day, my friend Kathy from Yorkshire announced it was her parent's 65th wedding anniversary. Imagine! 65 years! That is really something. I asked whether they would be getting a card from the Queen. The Queen sends a card to all people reaching 100, then when they are 105 and yearly after that. She also sends cards to people celebrating their diamond wedding (60 years), so I wondered if Kathy's parents wouldn't be entitled to another card. I found out they were and told my friend who duly applied for her parent's new card from the Queen. I was glad to hear they would get one. Receiving a card from the Queen on such occasions is very special and very English. I tried to explain the importance of it to my Spanish husband who just didn't get it. He didn't see why it was special and I couldn't really explain why as it is a very emotional thing. I once read that a lot of people in their old age were motivated to reach 100 just to get the card. That's wonderful. I do hope the new Government doesn't scrap this beautiful tradition. In any case, well done to Kathy's parents for their 65th wedding anniversary. If they reach 70 years of marriage they will get another one to add to their collection and one for each year after that too.<br></br>
<br></br>
That night when we went to the cinema to see Sam Mendes' film, 1917, I thought about the importance of WWI, often known as the Great War for my father and other post WW1 born children. No doubt it would have left a mark on them  as WW2 left a mark on me or as the Spanish Civil Wa5r did on my husband.  Eladio and I are usually fans of war films, especially the WW2 genre and less keen on films about WW1 about which there are far fewer.  I was hoping for a story based on people rather than on too much action in the famous trenches and I got the latter. You can see the<a href="https://draft.blogger.com/Film%20trailer:%20https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZjQROMAh_s"> trailer here </a>by the way.  I should have read the plot before buying the tickets then I would have known it would be all trenches and dreadful dreadful violence with rats, dead bodies everywhere and the most disgusting scenes which had me sinking my head in Eladio's arms. I couldn't bear the scenes of dead horses either and wondered just how Mendes did it. I can only hope they were all dummies. Just too much violence for me I'm afraid although I'm sure the film is very representative of a typical day in the trenches and fighting on the front in this most horrible and senseless of wars. This is the plot by the way (copied); "During World War I, two British soldiers Lance Cpl. Schofield and Lance Cpl. Blake  receive seemingly impossible orders. In a race against time, they must cross over into enemy territory to deliver a message that could potentially save 1,600 of their fellow comrades -- including Blake's own brother".<br></br>

On the bright side we were both amazed with the newly renovated cinemas where the wide and comfortable seats recline to make if feel as though you are lying in bed. How different to the cinemas I used to go to in Bradford in the 70's hahahhahaa.<br></br>
<br></br>
We were home late of course and had a late dinner. I was starving hahahhaah. I got a sudden new reservation request, again from a Chinese person. As the booking was instant I couldn't cancel it . Well, I can't turn down all Chinese guests for fear of the damned virus.   As it was an instant booking I couldn't refuse it. I could though if I wanted according to Airbnb's policy regarding Coronavirus. Not wanting to be discriminating but looking out for our safety, I politely asked my guest how long they had been out of China. He very understandingly told me they had been in Spain for 20 days and even sent me a photo of the exit stamp on his passport. I was rather relieved. It's funny how the whole issue of Coronavirus has even affected my humble Airbnb business.<br></br>
<br></br>
Later we lay in our beds and comfortably started watching a new series on Neflix (Stranger) which we would enjoy immensely.<br></br>
<br></br>
Thursday came, the day we left for Montrondo. I was deeply upset to read about yet another racist attack in the world.<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51577196"> A disturbed young man bent on killing muslims</a> went on the rampage in a small town in German, called Hanau. He killed 9 people in shisha bars and elsewhere in the town over a period of a few hours. He then went on to kill his own mother before killing himself. What madness I though and oh how I hate racism. The next day in London there was another racist attack when a man was arrested for attempted murder at a mosque in the centre of the city. The victim was the 70 year old muezzin who was leading the call to prayers when he was stabbed. Thankfully he survived. How awful!<br></br>
<br></br>
Awful was the next episode in my daily life that morning when we were preparing to leave for Montrondo. That's when my recent suspicions of robbery at home were confirmed. Someone who has worked for us for more than 15 years and who I have always trusted was apparently pilfering our larder weekly and taking heavy bags of food from our house every week. I was beginning to notice the diminishing of food, especially fruit and vegetables and couldn't really understand where they were all going. Was someone eating it all? No, they were stealing it. Other things have disappeared recently and if I look back, many things - including items from my lingerie - have disappeared over the years. We had noticed months ago that my father's biscuits were disappearing at the weekend so we hid most of them while the culprit was here. I had thought she was must have been eating them but it's clear now she was stealing them as she couldn't have eaten so many herself.  Ditto for washing detergent. If on a Saturday the 5 kilo box of detergent was full, come Monday morning there was hardly any left. I just thought she was putting too much into the washing machine and even told her so but again I realise now she was stealing it and on a large scale too. This person must have got braver recently as I never noticed things missing on such a large scale before, although other things including my only gold necklace went missing a few years ago. Also a small silver salt spoon belonging to my grandmother and which I used daily suddenly disappeared and no doubt she must have taken it thinking I wouldn't notice but I did. I've been looking for it and it's nowhere to be seen. I cannot confront this person who has deeply disappointed me as I don't have strong enough evidence and if I do she will no doubt deny it. We are going to keep her on but lay a trap to get concrete evidence. If it turns out our suspicions are confirmed, I'm afraid she must go but not until I find a replacement. This episode really took its toll on me on Friday. I was just imagining how much she must have stolen over the years - including tons of our washing detergent weekly - and at the same time coming across as  a trusted person I even considered a friend. I was good to her, finding her jobs with friends and family and this is how she pays me. I also feel dreadful that I was recommending a thief!<br></br>
<br></br>
We left home at about 10.40 or so after saying goodbye to my father, Lucy, Suzy and the other dogs. Of course, Pippa came with us. There would be no traditional stop at Rueda for wine, bread, ham and chocolate as I wanted to keep to healthy eating. Thus we decided to have lunch at a little restaurant in the small village of Pandorado - literally meaning "golden bread" - about 30 minutes from Montrondo. We were in luck as there were tables free. Amazingly, Casa Yordas, a very traditional establishment, offers lunches for 10 euros.<br></br>

Their menu of the day - a Spanish concept called "menu del día" -  included a choice of first courses, second courses and desserts and also included bread, wine and water and all for the paltry price of 10 euros. The food was good if simple but perfect for a roadside stop for lunch. Here is Eladio at the table. He was reading his phone or rather news on his phone. At the moment his main interest is in a story in the news called "Delcygate" which is about how Venezuelas' top government aide came to Spain and was met by the Minister of Transport, Abalos. The problem there is that there is an EU sanction for some members of Maduro's government to travel in EU countries. The story is getting bigger and bigger and includes the tale of Delcy Rodriguez bringing 40 luxury suitcases full of gold she would later take on her ongoing flight to Dubai. It's quite big news here at the moment and Eladio is loving every moment of it likening it to some of the thriller series we see on Netflix hahahhaaha.<br></br>

It was sunny but with a nip in the air when I set off at about 5.40. I was back by around 7 pm and just as I was coming home I got a whatsapp from my neighbour, Salo, to invite me to join her and the other ladies of the village for coffee at her house. I gladly accepted and it was good to see them and catch up on the village news.<br></br>
<br></br>
Eladio and I had an early dinner and a healthy one too hahaha. Later we watched the news. Eladio was tired and nodding off by 9 pm so went to bed. I stayed up wanting to watch "Cuéntame" a big hit here in Spain but fell asleep too. I woke up at  past midnight with a crick in my neck and sleepily made my way to our room. I didn't have a bad night's sleep but the crick in my neck was still there when I got up on Friday morning at 7 am.<br></br>
<br></br>
Friday was perhaps the highlight of the week, seeing us at the market in nearby Villablino (mining town) and exploring the little village of Robles de Laciana. We set off for Villablino at around 11 and were soon parked at Gadis, a supermarket I love and only to be found in the north of Spain. From here we went to have a coffee at a local bar and it was great to be allowed to take Pippa in with us. There has been a recent law passed allowing bar owners to be the ones to decide on whether dogs are allowed in or not. Thus Pippa got to have a bit of the free biscuits that came with the coffee. From the bar we walked in the brilliant sunshine to the Friday market. There I bought a pretty rainbow like scarf and Eladio bought 5 vests and all for a song. Ah and Eladio bought some chorizo, funnily enough made from beef and not pork. I'm not a fan. Here he is looking dapper in his sunglasses while paying for the spicy Spanish sausage.<br></br>

We also got some fresh, natural oranges - i.e. not the waxed ones. We got the rest of our fruit and veg and other provisions to last us the week here at Gadis. The town seemed bustling but it isn't really and was in the news last week as part of demonstrations in León, the capital and other towns in the province. The demonstrations were mostly about the decline of the area and lack of jobs. This has mostly come about because of the closure now of all mines and power stations. Villablino was an important town for coal mining and was once very rich; not so any more. The lack of jobs is driving young people to move out of the area and it is true to say that the ratio of retired people and babies is getting higher and higher. In the last few years 40.000 people moved away from the area. It didn't seem like that to me on Friday but I suppose it was because it was market day attracting people from the villages nearby.<br></br>
<br></br>
After our purchases we set off to visit one of these villages, Robles de Laciana, a tiny place perched high in the mountains with great views of the surrounding landscape. Eladio hadn't been there since he was a child and we were both surprised to find what a pretty village it is. In fact, it was voted the prettiest village in the province in 2011. We could see why when we saw the restaurant where we had booked a table - Hotel Rural La Bolera - and the magnificent little church, San Julian, built in the 11th century and which is partly Romanesque. We wished we could go inside. Here is Eladio posing for me by the church.<br></br>

We had twenty minutes or so to kill before our lunch booking and explored this pretty village. We were most impressed and wondered why we had never been before. We went on Friday as friends had recommended the restaurant which doubles as a country hotel. We were not disappointed. Here is Eladio outside the complex.<br></br>

We particularly liked the glass built dining room where the sun shone in and warmed up the atmosphere. We sat by the window and occasionally went out to check on Pippa who had to remain outside in the garden tied to her lead (sad). There is a cold cut famous in the area of León called "cecina", a sort of smoked beef which goes through a similar process to Spanish ham. I had to try it as I had read from reviews of the restaurant that it was outstanding. This it is and it was outstanding.<br></br>

Eladio went for the 11 euro menu of the day but I went for a la carte and chose lamb chops - my favourite.<br></br>
<br></br>
At around 3.30 after a lovely day out in Villablino and in Robles, we drove the short journey home to Montrondo. We both wanted a siesta. First we had to put away the shopping though. Here is just some of the fruit we bought.<br></br>

We both had a short siesta and then I went on my walk with Pippa. Eladio preferred to stay behind with one of his brothers to do some gardening. I left at around 6.10 pm and it was still sunny. It doesn't get really dark here now until way past 7 pm so I had a pleasant walk. On my way I was happy to see the horses, Shetland pony and its friend the grey donkey in the fields before Murias.<br></br>

I was happy to see too when I got back that I had walked more than 10km that day!!  All good. After dinner,  as usual we later watched the news. I was slightly shocked to hear about the further spread of the Coranavirus outside China including now northern Italy with cases in both Milan and now Rome.  In Italy, by today,   there were 79 cases, 2 deaths and 50.000 people in lock down. These people have been asked to stay at home for 2 weeks. One man died. The outbreak is in the north of the country where schools have been closed and public events cancelled.  The Italian government passed a law to impose lockdown in the focus areas; a dozen or so towns in the areas of Lombardy and Veneto. Imagine! The scary thing is that it is not clear how the first affected person contracted the disease. The other countries most affected are South Korea, Japan and Iran. In China there are over 76000 people with the disease and 2.348 have died. Not good news.<br></br>
<br></br>
Once we had had our fill of the news we turned to Netflix and continued watching Stranger. Meanwhile the girls had arrived at our apartment in Santa Pola. They had to ring Eladio as he is the only one of us who knows 1) how to turn on the water mains, 2) how to turn on the gas for cooking and hot water and 3) how to turn on the gas heater. A video call was in order so he could explain each of the processes to Suzy who, like her father, is quite good at anything slightly technical hahahhaaa.<br></br>
<br></br>
We went to bed early and I got quite a good night's sleep waking up at 7.30 on Saturday morning. Again the sun shone and we had blue skies. The temperature reached at least 20ºc on our walk that morning to Senra and back. I walked in a short sleeved T-shirt, a bit unheard of for this time of year. The lovely thing about the walk to Senra is the reward of a cup of coffee and a rest in the sun before walking back. Here is Eladio enjoying the moment.<br></br>

We were home by 1.30 and as I had prepared lunch before our walk, we were soon sitting at the table and eating a delicious meal of vegetable soup, fish and fresh artichokes. Probably tired from our walk both of us fell asleep over the news. We must be getting old hahhahaa. I remember, as a teenager, my mother falling asleep watching the TV with me and it used to annoy me. Well, it's me who does that these days. Pippa fell asleep too as you can see in the photo below of my dearest little dog covered in a white blanket. She does have a great life as a dog don't you think?<br></br>

We lounged around in the afternoon enjoying our sweet home away from home in the mountains. Meanwhile the girls were enjoying themselves in Santa Pola. In the morning they had breakfast on the terrace in the sun and later went to the market where you can get wonderful fruit and vegetables at low prices. They walked along the seafront which I'm sure was very healthy for little Elliot who I heard later was "enjoying his holiday" (hahaa) and then went to have paella (actually arroz a banda) at the well known restaurant, El Varadero. Here is the photo of my darling daughters with my darling grandson at the market yesterday morning.<br></br>

Believe it or not we were hungry again by 7.30 and I rustled up a dinner of cold cuts which we had with a salad and gazpacho. Later we watched the news again and it was all the same stories so we promptly fell asleep only to wake up at past 10 pm to the beginning of  the talent show, "Prodigios" (prodigy children) which we love. Last night's progarmme was superb but ended really late, after 1 am, in fact.<br></br>
<br></br>
I didn't sleep too badly and was up at 7.20 this morning. Today looks like another sunny day with blue skies and we shall make the most of it again. It's lovely being here on our own with few responsibilities and just time to be together.<br></br>
<br></br>
Now I must leave you. I have a pot boiling on the hob with chickpeas, meat, chorizo, bones and vegetables to make a "cocido madrileño" for today's lunch. But we shall have to earn it first by another long walk, maybe up the mountains this time.<br></br>
<br></br>
Hoping you all have a great Sunday, cheers till next week,<br></br>
