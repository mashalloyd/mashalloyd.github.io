How has your week been? Good I hope. We have had a very quiet and pleasant time in our village. So let me tell you all about it. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">The weeks seem to fly by in the summer. We are now at the end of July, perhaps the hottest period of the summer in Spain. That is why we escaped to Montrondo, to get away from the extreme heat of Madrid.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We escaped Covid to an extent as very few people live here which makes social distancing easy. However it continues to dominate the news. In Spain we are seeing a fifth wave with numbers nearing those of the infections in the UK. The only bright light is that few people are dying and few people are in Intensive Care. But we still have to be careful. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Last Sunday I wasn't thinking, for once, about Covid as it was a wonderful day for me, one of the days that will stick in my memory. That's because I had all my family with me. Again we couldn't go on our walk because of the heat. Thus it was the perfect time for picking more greengages from our bountiful fruit tree in front of the kitchen. Eladio got up on the ladder and handed me down the delicious green fruit. Of course greengages are actually just green plums and as with all fruit there is a variety. These are not what are known as "Reine Claude" (after a Queen in France) but a bigger version. When I was a child living in Ruskington in Lincolnsire (UK) we had a greengage tree and I first learned the word from my dear father who knows a lot about nature. Everything I know comes from him. When I gave him one of the "plums" for lunch, he said "you know they are called greengage". Of course I did. What I didn't know is why they are called that. There is a simple reason. A certain Sir William Gage of Suffolk imported the tree into England in the 18th century but lost the label. Thus the fruit was named after him. I didn't know either that they are considered the finest dessert plum and that the health benefits they reap are multiple. They help purify the colon and improve the processing of food. They are rich in vitamins C, A and K, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus and other names I can't pronounce but also protein. Apparently they help with anxiety too, keep heart disease at bay, are rich in antioxidants, reduce blood sugar and are also good for the bones (the calcium of course). Well, we have been eating them for a week now so I hope we have reaped some of these benefits. We have given a lot away and Miguel has made some jam. Of course the birds and our dogs have enjoyed them too. I only wish we had more fruit trees. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Eladio picked masses and there would be more in the afternoon when the girls were with us. </p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjP9MUHTdnb8igC7kgMlmmFeexus8uBsXaL0RN46rmuaS0iSSYGNFqy8SKltTejjRcfCROnoo078GAqYg1Mp4lIu0GEdfJdZRaRIO-4h27x4XejhVa3WAafPlZ5XB4PuXvYHx6ebw/s2543/Sunday+E+and+the+greengage+pickings.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjP9MUHTdnb8igC7kgMlmmFeexus8uBsXaL0RN46rmuaS0iSSYGNFqy8SKltTejjRcfCROnoo078GAqYg1Mp4lIu0GEdfJdZRaRIO-4h27x4XejhVa3WAafPlZ5XB4PuXvYHx6ebw/w400-h195/Sunday+E+and+the+greengage+pickings.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgjy1_wapJ4BbjjQNbYnZJY3sjrLexh0YAnUO51QxR2r4l88Mt_mO-zlKUmwZ9aiLP2NOKGld6QC0sJv6xNUC9Z4NZZI7pwcJr85qW3T69VAaYLpZrPqzdsCQr1-cSeLZcJy-2wGw/s2543/Sunday+greengage+picking+E+tree.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgjy1_wapJ4BbjjQNbYnZJY3sjrLexh0YAnUO51QxR2r4l88Mt_mO-zlKUmwZ9aiLP2NOKGld6QC0sJv6xNUC9Z4NZZI7pwcJr85qW3T69VAaYLpZrPqzdsCQr1-cSeLZcJy-2wGw/w195-h400/Sunday+greengage+picking+E+tree.jpg" width="195"></img></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLWlgtSFI6Qsx235MjD1WsVGEWGngkkTQSNwiB9pevuq3Y0BXZ3MfEJfavaxTA7VJ3JZ1vKikhuZuQEy21HE91ImNZ5MPnm8yOdZSGyjdOmdOHaN9B0vX-fjUDPWdIVM2pxwmhxw/s2543/Sunday+Greengages+and+branch.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLWlgtSFI6Qsx235MjD1WsVGEWGngkkTQSNwiB9pevuq3Y0BXZ3MfEJfavaxTA7VJ3JZ1vKikhuZuQEy21HE91ImNZ5MPnm8yOdZSGyjdOmdOHaN9B0vX-fjUDPWdIVM2pxwmhxw/w400-h195/Sunday+Greengages+and+branch.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Picking greengages last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Instead of our walk we  went food shopping to leave supplies for my father, Suzy and Lucy. Our group of guests, 4 young men from Vitoria were sleeping off a night on the tiles in Madrid. Lucy told me they had returned at 7 in the morning! Well, that's youth for you but it's also what is contributing to the spread of the virus. </div><p style="text-align: justify;">Sorry to interrupt my tales of last Sunday again with talk of Covid but that day it had affected the family of a dear friend of mine. . Until now I hardly knew anyone who  got it so I was shocked to learn from  Kathy from Keighley in Yorkshire, that her footballer son, Tom, got it on a trip to Scotland. He had had one dose of the vaccine but not two and was actually quite ill. I really hope he recovers soon. Many others are in the same fate or worse. If this time last Sunday the global number of infections and deaths was 190.797.676 and 4.099.170, today's figures have risen again and stand now at 194.425.481 and 4.168.714. In Spain and the UK and to a lesser extent France, the numbers rise every day alarmingly. Thankfully the mortality rate remains low.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In any case I didn't see the "boys" from last weekend's Airbnb group until they got up at about 1.30 (hahahaa). They had some coffee and by lunchtime had left. We had our lunch in peace. I made a beautiful Portuguese dish: "bacalhau á brás" - a fancy name for cod, onions, potatoes and eggs - which everyone loved.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The afternoon was ours for the taking. We slept a restoring siesta and at about 5.30 I went down to the pool with a cuppa (decaf), my kindle, towels and of course Pippa joined me. I had the pool entirely to myself. Soon Eladio came by and I went up to get his bathing suit. He hardly ever goes in the pool and needs coaxing. Once in, he loves it. Here is one of this summer's historic pictures; Eladio in the water.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhlo6wlcXmrfOaba4EWaG2Bi0lcAOA3X7noC-MqtOWXuCI0v4vHljGrPPoNpQ8xQ5JUl-PckWpkB5TVUztP3bso0LVXblr0mL24aip64xJNB_hcVFZD0UqrYXlHdpAyOMXYN3r3PA/s2543/Sunday+E+in+the+pool.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhlo6wlcXmrfOaba4EWaG2Bi0lcAOA3X7noC-MqtOWXuCI0v4vHljGrPPoNpQ8xQ5JUl-PckWpkB5TVUztP3bso0LVXblr0mL24aip64xJNB_hcVFZD0UqrYXlHdpAyOMXYN3r3PA/w400-h195/Sunday+E+in+the+pool.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMoT7veTdoquAbymgxXmwgoQeWMzxUnLRmxlYQ1OOIx7KzVhrESM4QzapYbUcKL-RPq50_nUY8yVblmqYXc9_sgu3DV4i0fppQmjOGrvdbOjOXYEx7QH2GjcHSEgymx4VWfiSv7Q/s2543/20210718_180829.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMoT7veTdoquAbymgxXmwgoQeWMzxUnLRmxlYQ1OOIx7KzVhrESM4QzapYbUcKL-RPq50_nUY8yVblmqYXc9_sgu3DV4i0fppQmjOGrvdbOjOXYEx7QH2GjcHSEgymx4VWfiSv7Q/w400-h195/20210718_180829.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio in the pool last Sunday - an unusual occurrence </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">By about 6 pm, Oli and her family joined us. They had been to lunch at Miguel's parents' house. Miguel goes very often now as his father, sadly, is ill. We were delighted to see Elliot. What a funny little boy he is. At first he didn't want to go in the water, preferring to be with his father and grandfather. Then he took them by the hand and led them to where we "girls" were on the other side of the pool. I had to have a photo.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghONcRWnYsBVnNmjjZrUT6-agNUm6BIfAXP3JIZz9nUCduS1YfI5uD25A4aQWtn2pV13RqVa3TQHzCGVaANgKH-D7eYUVtiy8r3AUjSQmCC1rvRWuiHqmQ88_5yV1UnWUvbc3CyA/s2543/20210718_183942.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghONcRWnYsBVnNmjjZrUT6-agNUm6BIfAXP3JIZz9nUCduS1YfI5uD25A4aQWtn2pV13RqVa3TQHzCGVaANgKH-D7eYUVtiy8r3AUjSQmCC1rvRWuiHqmQ88_5yV1UnWUvbc3CyA/w400-h195/20210718_183942.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Three generations: Grandfather, grandson and father - son in law</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was such a lovely relaxing family afternoon together at the best place to be in the heat; our pool. We don't use it much and of course we leave it to all our guests, so maybe I appreciated it a bit more last Sunday when we were all together.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Oli and family stayed for dinner. It was even hot at 8 pm and we had to move the kitchen patio table further into the garden in the shade. We had a make shift dinner of cold dishes: gazpacho, cold vegetable soup, salad, ham, humus and some of the pie leftover from Asturias. To wash it all down we drank some Asturian cider. Dessert should have been greengages and it was but I also brought out the Magnum and mint chocolate ice cream tubs I had bought that morning. The Magnum was gobbled up by all. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Wanting to give Oli and family more plums, Miguel picked some. Then Eladio had the grand idea of shaking the tree and oh my the result was hilarious. We were all, wrongly, underneath and greengages literally rained on us. I took a video or thought I did but nothing came out. What a pity.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">All in all it was a great day. We were in bed by 10 and I slept quite well that night. I was happy to wake up to read an article in which I featured and which  the Swimmy Communications Director, Estafania, sent  me. It was about the sharing economy and different platforms, like Airbnb, that allow people to rent out all sorts of places, such as their swimming pools. Swimmy is an app to rent private pools. The article was the result of an interview with Sputnik News, of all media - the Russian news agency. The journalist, Esther, had interviewed me on the phone the previous week, just as we were leaving El Cuetu. I was very flattered that she had used the photo of my pool as the feature photo. You can read the article <a href=" https://mundo.sputniknews.com/20210719/quedar-en-un-castillo-o-una-cueva-el-boom-del-alquiler-por-horas-en-espana-de-cualquier-lugar-1114156272.html">here</a>.

We left at around 11.30 and by lunchtime were in Rueda, the town of the famous white wine growing area. In Rueda we always stop at Palacio de Bornos. It is part of the journey to Montrondo and I wouldn't have it any other way.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We always have a plate of ham, a plate of lomo, a basket of bread and wash it all down with the best white wine in the world from this Bodega (Palacio de Bornos). I prefer the local grape called "verdejo" and Eladio prefers the lighter grape "sauvignan". I had to choose the picture of me that Eladio took for this week's feature photo as at that moment I was happy and cheering  life; living life to the full to quote my friend Kathy.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We got more supplies from this amazing bodega which sells lots of local produce. We bought wine, oil, bread and some of their amazing white chocolate with almonds. We always eat a bit of the chocolate as we resume our journey.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">By 5 or so we were in Montrondo where the temperature was  26c,  10 degrees less than Madrid. I only wish it was that temperature all year round everywhere and that it only rained at night. In the UK, my friends were sweltering in the mid 20's which for Spaniards is pleasant weather. But, of course, my countrymen don't have air con or swimming pools. As a child I remember we would get out the hose pipe in the garden on warm summer days of which there weren't very many. In the UK, that day, 19th July, all Covid restrictions were lifted and it was known as "Freedom Day". That is crazy as the number of infected does nothing but rise. In Spain that day the number went above 60.000. However the death rate was very very low as was the number of people in ICUs. Those are the numbers to watch.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">While we were travelling to Montrondo, Lucy let me know the technician had fixed internet - there was some problem with the fixed line - but she also told me "we" had left our luggage behind. That's the second time it's happened recently. But it wasn't me, although I should have checked. I do the packing and Eladio puts everything in the car. Well, once again, he forgot. Oh dear, this meant I only had the clothes I was wearing. I do have clothes in Montrondo but they are all winter clothes. I wondered what we would do. My husband didn't feel at all bothered. I did and I felt cross too.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Thus unpacking took a very short time and soon we were outside in the garden behind the house and lying on the sunbeds, reading.  I wasn't at all hungry for dinner but rustled up a simple meal which we had on the front terrace, just outside the kitchen. By then it was cooler as the minimum temperatures are far lower in Montrondo than in Madrid. Eladio put on the heating believe it or not and I put on some long sleeved pyjamas! What a difference from home.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We later slumped in front of the TV and fell asleep very shortly. Unbelievably for me I was in bed by just after 10 pm. I woke up at 5, then at  6 and finally got up just before 7 am. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was great to be back in our village and especially to have escaped the heat of Madrid. Pippa was especially pleased. She loves being here just as we do. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhPjDe87jzEbU0VEPCm4fGabauq0ASmJ_VF0KNluZPdYEngmrYva8fhVQqsfrJhcnyMVlvOppIET38RQhBn0B14QnmLz87QNvKZncbsIRGuWbSvL5bcq6b80E36TnILtFwbXTlNTg/s717/Tuesday+Pippa+la+era.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="194" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhPjDe87jzEbU0VEPCm4fGabauq0ASmJ_VF0KNluZPdYEngmrYva8fhVQqsfrJhcnyMVlvOppIET38RQhBn0B14QnmLz87QNvKZncbsIRGuWbSvL5bcq6b80E36TnILtFwbXTlNTg/w400-h194/Tuesday+Pippa+la+era.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Pippa, happy to be back in Montrondo</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">That morning we went shopping to the nearest town, Villablino, and came home loaded with provisions for the rest of our stay.

I have sort of lost interest in the news these days. It's only depressing stuff about more and more Covid infections. I should have got excited about the second private and commercial flight into space but I wasn't. If a week or so ago Virgin's owner and CEO, Richard Branson had flown to the edge of space, that day it was the turn of his rival entrepreneur, Amazon's Jeff Bezos. You know why I wasn't impressed? Well I think it is because I do not admire the greed of super rich people. They have done it all and can afford anything in the world yet they need and want to do more. So flying into space is their thing. They remind me of a boss I once had at Yoigo. His secretary told me he wasn't satisfied with 5 star hotels and asked her to find 7 star hotels. That's sheer greed. Don't get me wrong; I like the good life but I detest greed and the fact that people are never satisfied. They always want more. I want more too but with limits and I know how to appreciate what I have. So yes he went into space but I didn't care. Maybe he should have spent some of the money on the people who do the really hard work for Amazon, the packers and the deliverers. I wonder if you agree. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Instead of the news we watched a film and what a film. Titanic was on, one of our all time favourites. I hadn't seen it for yonks. We enjoyed every minute of it and stayed up till nearly 2 in the morning until the end. In my opinion there are very few great films out there and this is one of the good ones. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I was awake at 7.30 am on Wednesday morning. I was upset to get a message from our lodger, Felipe. He told me the group that had arrived very late that night, had turned the swimming pool terrace into a loud discotheque. Damn the guys. I wrote to them to say the neighbours had complained and had threatened to call the police (they hadn't) and asked them to refrain from putting on loud music again. I even looked up the rules for music and noise in the Madrid area and sent them to the person who had made the reservation. In all my 4 years or more of experience with hosting guests, I have had very few rowdy groups so I've been lucky but I was not lucky with this group. Damn them again! Luckily after telling them off they didn't do it again.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Wednesday was another quiet and pleasant day. We stayed at home all day until the evening. Lunch was my famed Portuguese cod dish "bacalhau á brás" made with cod, onions, potatoes and eggs. The highlight of the day was my Facetime call with Kathy and family. They were all in their English garden. English gardens in the summer when the weather is warm are unbeatable. It was just as warm here but of course I am used to it. We spent the afternoon on the sunbeds in the back garden until about 8 pm when it just started to get cooler. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We had booked a table at the only restaurant and bar in Murias, the next village. The main idea was to walk to dinner and walk back afterwards. As to the restaurant, well it was a bit of a disappointment. The menu is very small and there wasn't much on it that we wanted. The bar attendants were not very customer friendly so I doubt we shall be going back. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_ItMjTr1VmZUqlSxMbOEb3xbw7JAgNe42wMRB-JH69ZdE1kcdh7zsozsq69sMzZ2FaNVciRvBDVo3W6yYVxyaimxv7oSH3nAeZQ1eTHVCzTcxZtr34q2kg28JTw4RlEHkC82_aw/s2543/Wed+outside+bar.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_ItMjTr1VmZUqlSxMbOEb3xbw7JAgNe42wMRB-JH69ZdE1kcdh7zsozsq69sMzZ2FaNVciRvBDVo3W6yYVxyaimxv7oSH3nAeZQ1eTHVCzTcxZtr34q2kg28JTw4RlEHkC82_aw/w195-h400/Wed+outside+bar.jpg" width="195"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The bar in Murias,"El Holandés Errante,  with a limited menu and unfriendly staff</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br></br></div><div>What was divine was the walk back at 10 o'clock at night when it was still light.

José Manuel went to school with Eladio and was also sent to a seminary to become a priest (he didn't in the end). He went on to become a school teacher like his wife and they live near Seville. We hadn't seen them for 2 years owing to the pandemic and it was great to catch up.

It only costs 1.99 pounds so please buy a copy and if you do please leave a comment. The more comments I get the more people will see it. There is also a marketing plan in place which looks very humble and shortly the book in printed format will be available in the book shops or at least I hope it will. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div>That afternoon I didn't have a siesta.

I had to have a photo of the two men who went to school together. Of their class in Montrondo back in the 60's there were only a handful who went on to study and they were two of them. That they went on to study was thanks to the Catholic Church. Both of them were sent to a Seminary at an early age. The other alternative was to continue life in the village and become either a farmer or a miner. That was life in Spanish villages in the 50's and 60's. So different to life in England where I grew up.</div><div><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEheJCkxrGFofAI05MMXyG82jUWfyeAxyPqIzg9TT5kXT01c5eIqkKmOQcVO4scWkkNAQAtWcQGl-TsazW4E5hggJsZIw5md91W5TlBXjbTkmIsKNgeJQlNQ21hK-o2gtNLzZ5nFnw/s717/Friday+coffee+friends+E+and+JM.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEheJCkxrGFofAI05MMXyG82jUWfyeAxyPqIzg9TT5kXT01c5eIqkKmOQcVO4scWkkNAQAtWcQGl-TsazW4E5hggJsZIw5md91W5TlBXjbTkmIsKNgeJQlNQ21hK-o2gtNLzZ5nFnw/w400-h195/Friday+coffee+friends+E+and+JM.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio with his old school friend, José Manuel</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br></br></div><div>At about 7.30 we set off on our walk.
