<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The week has
been busy and good in many ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I hope
yours was good too.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">This week
Olivia was working again from Valencia; something she tries to do as much as
possible so as to be with her boyfriend Miguel who lives there and works as a
cameraman for Spanish TV.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Monday saw her
reporting on a lovely story about practically free housing for evicted people
in La Alcudia in Valencia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She appeared
twice that morning and you can see her <a href="http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/la-manana-de-la-1/manana-1-03-12-12/1599170/">here</a> if you fast forward to 13.49h.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">She seemed
happy to be making the report and I’m sure as a journalist she would also loved
to have reported on the great British news of the week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>For on Monday Buckingham Palace confirmed
that Kate Middleton, also known as the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9719842/Kate-Duchess-of-Cambridge-pregnant-the-most-anticipated-baby-since-Prince-William.html">Duchess of Cambridge, was 2 months pregnant</a>, the most anticipated royal birth since Prince William himself. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>The news was great, what was not so great was
what transpired later. An Australian radio programme rang the King Edward VII hospital
where the Duchess had been admitted for acute morning sickness, and pretending
to be the Queen of England and the Prince of Wales the programe DJs actually
managed to talk to the 46 year old India nurse Jacintha Saldanha looking after
her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The conversation went live and the
poor nurse had no idea this was a hoax.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Later this week she committed suicide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>This deeply saddened the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as it did the
whole world.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The royal baby
will be third in line to the throne and as Salic Law has been revoked in
England, unlike Spain, it won’t matter if the baby is a girl or a boy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>There has been talk that the birth could be
twins and as we spoke about the news at lunch the other day, Eladio wondered
who would one day become King or Queen of England if the birth was a
cesarean.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That is a very good question
and I wonder if there if is a law in this case or whether it is the surgeon who
decides by taking out one of the twins first rather than the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>If there is no law, he would have a very big
decision to make.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Let’s hope it doesn’t
come to that.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Monday I
was very busy with confidential work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Yoigo was to announce the inclusion of the iPhone in its portfolio,
something our customers have been clamouring for a long time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We knew that but until we had the go ahead
from Apple’s HQ in Cupertino in Silicon Valley, we could not let anyone
know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>For those of you who have never
worked with Apple as a corporation, you cannot begin to imagine just how strict
they are and how many conditions and procedures must be fulfilled before you
can go to market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They dictate the exact
wording of your press release – where you have to say that their operating
system is the best in the world – and it is the company’s top two executives
who give you the final go ahead to announce the go to market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Our problem was we were in a rush to include
this iconic product in our Christmas campaign and all that that entails and any
delay in the launch would have put the campaign at risk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We didn’t actually get the go ahead until
Wednesday afternoon at a very late hour for Spanish media and bad timing too as
the next day was a bank holiday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was
so relieved when we finally hit the push button and sent the laconic press
release out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It meant we could finally
confirm all the rumours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It also meant
that the market was to learn that Yoigo will be selling the iPhone 5 and the
other models at the best price in the market.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>You can read the press release <a href="http://www.yoigo.com/sobreyoigo/pdf/132_Yoigo_iPhone.doc">here </a>(in Spanish).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I am now waiting avidly for my own device and
wonder whether I will like it as much as the Samsung Galaxy S3. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Tuesday was a
very full day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I went to the hairdresser
early in the morning and of course worked hard from home most of the
morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Oli was on the television again
and this time the story was about toys for deprived children at Christmas which
is funded by a biro sold by TVE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The
news was that this year, for the first time, Spanish children would be included
– another sign of our times and thanks to the crisis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Olivia reported from the factory in Valencia
where the biros are made and you can see her <a href="http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/la-manana-de-la-1/manana-1-04-12-12/1600600/">here</a> if you fast forward to 13.45.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The crisis
affects us all and not only in Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
was deeply saddened to read later that day that Nokia will actually be <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/2012/12/04/struggling-nokia-sells-headquarters-building/wQ8BrrlWL6sgUfVE3KyvxI/story.html">selling their flagship HQ</a>, called Nokia House in Espoo just outside Helsinki.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I love that building and used to love going
there, feeling proud to work for Nokia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Things have changed since I worked for that wonderful Finnish company
and it is sad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Here is a photo I took on
one of my trips there in the “good old days”. It is of the inside which is
spectacular; made of wood and glass and steel and a marvel of Nordic
architecture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Nokia House sits by the
sea and is made of glass so all light penetrates this marvelous building where
workers sit in open plan offices with views of the sea on one side and of the
lake or river on the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>If I found
this news sad, I wonder how the people who still work there feel – devastated
I’m sure.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Tuesday too
I had lunch with Suzy, what we call girly lunches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I haven’t seen much of her lately, so it was
good to get some quality time together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>She is at a crossroads in her life at the moment as she plans to leave
Spain and actually has a ticket to London for 8<sup>th</sup> May.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It is in London, like Dick Turpin, that she
plans to find her fortune.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Again this is
thanks to the crisis as, although she has always wanted to work in London, what
has pushed her to make the decision is the appalling pay she gets with her
otherwise very satisfying job as a dietitian with Armark Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I wish her all the luck in the world and look
forward to visiting her in London, the city of my dreams and where I never
actually got the chance to live or work.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">And finally
Tuesday evening came and brought with it the ex Nokia Spain first reunion
Christmas dinner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I got together some 60
people from both the network and mobile phones division, mostly through
Facebook but also thanks to many whatsapp messages, emails and other means of
contact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was to be held at Gobolem, a
delightful cozy restaurant in Las Rozas where Martin, the owner, put on a
splendid buffet dinner with the whole place to our selves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>My thanks go to Beatriz from QE for her help
in decorating the restaurant with poinsettias, photos from the past and a
wonderful photo call.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The evening
was amazing and everyone was so happy to see everyone that it was difficult to
get them to eat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I really think that if
we had just had bread and water in a garage we would have been just as
happy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I got so many compliments and
thanks from people for making the night possible that it was quite
embarrassing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But I felt the whole
effort was really worthwhile.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The only
damper on the evening was the presence of someone (IM for this purpose),
someone I hadn’t invited and someone who used to make my life a misery in the
last period of my time at Nokia. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I was
amazed when Martin approached me during the dinner to say that someone had
asked for the bill for the whole dinner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>We had all paid 50 euros each mostly by bank transfer so there was to be
no overall bill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was obvious to me
that whoever had asked for it had no good intentions. I asked Martin who the
person was and he pointed to I.M.M.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I just
told Martin to say no.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was appalled at
this person’s behavior but soon forgot about it, until a few days later when he
sent me a private message on FB asking me for the bill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The reason he said was to use it as an
expense to claim for his small consulting firm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I replied that I knew he had asked for it at the restaurant and that I
had said no and that I thought his behavior was not elegant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Believe it or not he wrote again yesterday to
insist adding that it could do no harm to anyone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I replied curtly that what he was asking me
to do was to become involved in a crime called fraud and that such activity
would harm the country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This incident
brought back all the bad memories of this person who, even after leaving the
company, has come back to haunt me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So
yes, the reunion was great but left me with a bittersweet memory because of
this incident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I still feel shocked at
his behavior.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>If he writes again, this
time I shall not answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>What would you
have done?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was very tempted to publish
the story openly but in the end decided not to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I suppose it is best to forget and just to carry on. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Wednesday I
published the photos of that wonderful reunion dinner which you can see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/media/set/?set=a.10151374490276554.540639.612236553&amp;type=3">here</a>.</span><br></br>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Wednesday’s
highlight was a little trip to Gran Plaza 2 shopping centre to do some more
Christmas shopping.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I indulged a little myself
and bought a dark green jumper dress from H+M.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Thursday 6<sup>th</sup>
December was a holiday in Spain to celebrate the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was also Independence Day in Finland and
both my Father and I remembered going to the Parador in Gredos in 2007 with my
dearest Finnish friend Anne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We actually
stayed there on the same bank holiday and you might be interested to know that
it was here that the new Spanish Constitution we are celebrating today was
begun. We must do that again one day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However,
the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/media/set/?set=a.10151374490276554.540639.612236553&amp;type=3">Spanish Paradors </a>(state run hotels in monumental buildings) are in the news
this week and the news is not good thanks to the crisis again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Some are being shut down completely, like the
lovely one in Verín where we have stayed twice and some will be shut down in
the winter months and many jobs will be cut.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/07/uk-spain-hotels-idUSLNE8B602B20121207">The Parador workers have been on strike this week</a>. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I do hope that the Parador in Gredos is not
one of those being shut down.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Thursday was
really quiet at home and only livened up when Susana joined us for lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I must add that afterwards she went off to be
with her friends at Rocio’s new flat in Majadahonda, another of their friends
to fly the nest.</span></div>

in between day; the day after the holiday and the day before another holiday 8<sup>th</sup>
December which celebrates the Immaculate Conception.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Some people have all three days off which is
called a “Puente” (bridge).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I didn’t
take the day off but worked quietly from home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

working from Valencia on Friday and her report that day was actually from far away
Murcia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The news was sad: a married
couple in their 80’s were found dead in their house in San Javier, from
suspected robbery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You can see the story

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">She came back from
Valencia with Miguel that night but we weren’t to see them until the next day. Friday’s
highlight was dinner with Eladio and this week we went to <a href="http://www.la-alpargateria.com/restaurantes/restaurante-c-c-heron-city">La Alpargatería</a>, not
the one we used to go to which shut down in Majadahonda, but to the one in
<a href="http://www.heroncitymadrid.com/">Herón City</a> in Las Rozas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We liked it but
didn’t feel at home as we did at the one that shut down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Saturday of
course was a holiday again and another day off for Oufa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I spent the morning cooking for a big family
lunch. The menu was perushki (small Russian pies filled with minced meat,
onions and rice), homemade ham croquettes, chicken waldorf salad and fruit
salad. Suzy said over lunch that it felt like a mini Christmas Eve dinner and
it did in a way as we usually include these ingredients on the 24<sup>th</sup>
December.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The rest of the day went past
like most Saturday afternoons: our siesta, our walk with the dogs, a bit of
reading in the lounge with candle light and music, then a quick dinner in the
kitchen, then the news on the TV in bed followed by Informe Semanal during
which I always fall asleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So much for
Saturday night on the tiles; that is how our Saturday nights nearly always ocurr.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">And today is
Sunday and I am writing from my desk in our study.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Eladio is preparing lessons at his desk next
to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Oufa is in the kitchen making us
our first Moroccan meal: chicken and vegetable couscous and Olivia is revising
for an exam next week – an exam for a permanent position with TVE based in
Melilla (Spanish occupied Morocco!).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She
is very unlikely to pass as there are at least 50 other people taking the exam
and many with more initial points than her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Even so, I think she still has a chance, albeit very slim. And I am in a
hurry to finish this week’s blog post as this afternoon we have organized an
event at home. I am doing a sort of car boot sale of the girls’ cast off
clothes, many of them still in fashion and some still with shop labels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Olivia is the clothes hoarder, buying new
clothes all the time and her wardrobes are bursting with clothes she no longer
wears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Lots of their friends will be
coming and we plan to do the “mercadillo” in the lounge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I will tell you how it went in next week’s
blogpost.</span></div>
