Mine has been quiet and has had some highlights as you will read after the update on coronavirus in the world. It continues to dominate all our lives. Numbers rise everywhere. No one is free of it. If last week it was Donald Trump who had it, this week we heard that football ace, Cristiano Ronaldo, also tested positive. In Spain we are possibly in the middle of the curve of the second phase but haven't reached the peak yet.  In the UK, Boris Johnson and his government introduced the three tier system to combat the pandemic ever growing there. Critics think it's unfair to the hospitality industry and that it comes late and is not enough as figures rise alarmingly. Here is the map of England divided into the tiers with the north in a much worse state and Liverpool with the highest number of infections; over 600 per 100.000. It was dreadful to see huge crowds partying on the streets of Liverpool just hours before lock down began. How crazy can you get?</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzXunJXWH7b-_2ssQ19rsfnyEaIReYq0ZnCChdZrm0UKcA1fDn2J0q8DzVFEFtgNQDwO3bNDljiuQDfGcdf9AQ9N2ls3ozfxzOhK0iozuBUAGED8nZdJMeOATxeCYTAg0qDHAV-g/s791/2_heat-map-4s.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzXunJXWH7b-_2ssQ19rsfnyEaIReYq0ZnCChdZrm0UKcA1fDn2J0q8DzVFEFtgNQDwO3bNDljiuQDfGcdf9AQ9N2ls3ozfxzOhK0iozuBUAGED8nZdJMeOATxeCYTAg0qDHAV-g/w311-h400/2_heat-map-4s.jpg" width="311"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Map of England and the three tiers</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">And below are the rules for the three tiers. The only areas with limit on movement are those in Tier 3. Later in the week it was announced that London would go into Tier two along with my beloved city York and my not so beloved Essex. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg23cRQsixlNeJrZWlarDSGRIBVaBTCo7OOCYZb9jyOcyOP3hETGMy30M1aWrq6kTsu4Lk5CL4i6KkIHzSjpCjSCIp5Tlt2_ZYU2kb3hkm_OVdUVIJCrlVp_h7Msi7bXMIc6_IYtg/s2048/KH-GRAPHIC-NEW-COVID19-LOCKDOWN-LEVELS-v6-1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg23cRQsixlNeJrZWlarDSGRIBVaBTCo7OOCYZb9jyOcyOP3hETGMy30M1aWrq6kTsu4Lk5CL4i6KkIHzSjpCjSCIp5Tlt2_ZYU2kb3hkm_OVdUVIJCrlVp_h7Msi7bXMIc6_IYtg/w263-h400/KH-GRAPHIC-NEW-COVID19-LOCKDOWN-LEVELS-v6-1.jpg" width="263"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The three tier system in the UK and the rules for each area. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">The government had hoped to make the rules clearer and the same as in Spain, everyone is confused. I follow the figures in the Spain and the UK very closely. Spain has far more many cases with over 900.000 and the UK over 600.000. Countries are judged on the number of cases whereas I think they should really be judged on the number of fatalities. That's the most important number. In Spain, that number is high at over 33.000 but in the UK with fewer cases the death toll is much higher at over 43.000. What is the reason for that I ask myself?  It is not a question being addressed by the media but I think it is revealing. The UK has a far higher population so should have more cases, but why are there more deaths than in Spain if there are more cases in my adopted country? In essence why are more UK nationals dying than Spaniards? </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This week we have seen the figures rise dramatically in other areas of Europe besides Spain. The figures for the Czech Republic, France, the UK, Holland and even Italy and Germany were on the rise giving the impression that in fact what has happened is that some of these countries are just a few weeks behind Spain. This week we there were days when the numbers of newly infected in France and the UK were above 30 and 20 thousand respectively. As to cases per 100.000, Spain is not at the top of the list. The top countries, in this order are: Czech Republic (581.3), Belgium (469.5), Holland (412.2), France (307.1), Spain (293.1), Portugal (140.2), Italy (86.9) and Germany (54.6). My source here was a chart presented by Olivia one morning this week. </div><p style="text-align: justify;">God knows what will happen when winter sets in and the flu season starts. Worldwide this Sunday the total number of cases stands at just under 40 million and the death toll is 1.114.636. God knows when a vaccine will be available. On the subject of vaccines, we have to get our flu vaccine soon. The nurse from the Health centre came to give my father his this week. They may be overloaded but they take good care of him. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Last Sunday was a quiet day for us at least until the evening. It was a sunny day too although the temperatures dropped a bit. We took our lovely dogs for their walk and our walk of course and as usual on Sundays there were lots of cyclists. The dogs are always tired afterwards and as soon as they have drunk copious amounts of water they retire to their beds for a morning nap. I caught them on camera to show you. It's a beautiful sight for dog lovers. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjrmidHIzdwfpsdCQwY6I3oeVX8p7bmktf4BpoQSQO8TZfzAVaCpskrrF9hRpvgiLNnpsgxLfFhIZdA7_k-jo15yf4pbsiOY_fB0JGvn5hdyqRecYE01LHLaLz_erXTbCW1CJpJxA/s2543/Sunday+dogs.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjrmidHIzdwfpsdCQwY6I3oeVX8p7bmktf4BpoQSQO8TZfzAVaCpskrrF9hRpvgiLNnpsgxLfFhIZdA7_k-jo15yf4pbsiOY_fB0JGvn5hdyqRecYE01LHLaLz_erXTbCW1CJpJxA/w400-h195/Sunday+dogs.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our three dogs taking a morning nap after their walk last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">They now have a bed each. It used to be that Norah and Elsa had a bed each, the larger one for Elsa our lab, usually grabbed by Norah our cheeky beagle. Pippa, our miniature chocolate coloured dachshund, shared Elsa's bed until last week in Santa Pola our neighbour Lucy gave us her ex cat's bed. She immediately fell in love with it although it is a bit small for her but she just curls up and fits in its softness. She also matches its colour, brown. Aren't they adorable?</div><p style="text-align: justify;">Between Zena and I we organised lunch and then I was free to read or do whatever I wanted. After seeing the documentary about Edward VIII, great grandson of Queen Victoria,  who abdicated from the throne of England to marry the love of his wife, the twice divorced American socialite, Wallis Simpson, I was intrigued to know more about that time in history. While I was watching the documentary I realised of course that my father would have lived through the moment which shook the British crown. When Edward VIII abdicated in favour of his brother, George VI, the current Queen's father, my own father would have been 15 years old. I understand that the whole episode shook every corner of the Establishment. It has always been rumoured that the ex King, later the Duke of Windsor, had sympathies to the Nazi cause. This intrigued me too so I watched another documentary, "Edward VIII, the traitor king" on You Tube. If the story is true which it probably is, then he was indeed a traitor to his country. I then looked for a decent biography and came upon what seems to be the definitive one by historian Philip Ziegler.  I began reading it in in the afternoon. It's a bit heavy going and I haven't even got to the part where he meets Wallis Simpson yet. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">We were alone for lunch with my father as both girls had gone to have lunch at their great friend, Elenita's house. I had a short siesta but was soon awake and downstairs. It was sunny so I took my cup of decaf tea to the swimming pool terrace and plopped myself down on one our of our very comfortable sun loungers. It was so warm I had to take all my clothes off down to my bra and t-shirt. Pippa was with me and I spent a very pleasant time. When the sun moved away from the pool area, I took the sun lounger to the bottom of the garden in search of more sun to continue reading. I was joined by Eladio and we spent a quiet time there until the sun disappeared and it became cold.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">While we were having a very quiet afternoon, Spain's number one tennis player and one of the world's best ever, Rafa Nadal, was playing the number one player Djokovic on the latter's favourite surface, clay, in the final of the French Open, more commonly known as Roland Garros. He beat him in three sets the first at 6-0 and his winning shot was an ace. What an amazing game. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkQCIHyu0D9Iy3nlurqg5QEnLTv0Sso7ADXNGRS7IZbLK2oNFEJFJMvAcclgmLVG6u_4jkNdiUz-CokJeac4GW2QdirhLU0ajikZXY2IrnsyPXCdt8Sv59wmpj6_1W2jjcDAoUHA/s620/image.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="213" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhkQCIHyu0D9Iy3nlurqg5QEnLTv0Sso7ADXNGRS7IZbLK2oNFEJFJMvAcclgmLVG6u_4jkNdiUz-CokJeac4GW2QdirhLU0ajikZXY2IrnsyPXCdt8Sv59wmpj6_1W2jjcDAoUHA/w400-h213/image.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Nadal celebrating his extraordinary win on Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">When he lifted la Coupe de Mousquetaires for the 13th time in his life, he also became the player to equal his rival and friend, Roger Federer's 20 grand slam titles. Now they are on a par and are perhaps the best players ever to have walked the earth. What a win for Spain and what an achievement. No one has ever won the French Open that many times and to think that the Mallorcan won it for the first time when he was just 19 in 2005. Last Sunday, aged 34, he was on his best form ever. A BBC tennis commentator remarked that he was on such good form that even if two players were competing against him, the Spaniard would have won. Tributes poured in from all over the world and of those I saw the one I liked best came from Roger Federer. For the record this is what he wrote.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKZUIvEEFZ8W6YiaZQGS7w74SWlqvqcGugbOxwSKuO27sgBy54Z_WFZ2f8fPlfb1XLlUGfJJv9EtdLY36-eEkUvHsAyMNZezmOW9HG-ZaARAkmKhbqhXUG80YTJezDn7ZFeGWMGQ/s1242/Federer%2527s+homage+to+Rafa.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="351" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKZUIvEEFZ8W6YiaZQGS7w74SWlqvqcGugbOxwSKuO27sgBy54Z_WFZ2f8fPlfb1XLlUGfJJv9EtdLY36-eEkUvHsAyMNZezmOW9HG-ZaARAkmKhbqhXUG80YTJezDn7ZFeGWMGQ/w400-h351/Federer%2527s+homage+to+Rafa.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Words from Federer for Nadal</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><div style="text-align: justify;">I have to say his win on Sunday afternoon lifted my spirits and was good news for this country, good news we all need in these times of doom and gloom. </div><p style="text-align: justify;">The girls were coming for dinner together with Miguel and little Elliot. They would spent the night too. It was lovely having Elliot to stay again. We hadn't seen our 1 year old grandson for a whole week which is a long time at his age as he doesn't always recognise us when time has lapsed in between visits.  His progress week on week is amazing. If the Sunday before he already walked 4 or 5 steps unaided, he now walks quite well. He also now says "papa", his first words. It's funny to watch him as often when he says it he holds something to his ear as if he were talking on a mobile hahahahaha. He is now also saying "ma ma ma". They arrived just before dinner which we made all together in our guest free house.  Elliot especially loves the dogs and the magnets on our fridge. He prefers real food to his purees and knocked his puree dinner from his high chair during dinner hahahahhaa. Later Eladio entertained him reading to him from one of his first books, the touchy feely type. It was a gift from my great friend Sandra. He also loves the Very Hungry Caterpillar gifted to him by another great friend, Kathy. At home his mother reads him Joanne's Spot Book which he adores too. Here he is enjoying the moment with his grandfather to whom he is very attached and with his Aunty Suzy.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxXFiUhF82OCl-hpBCdLO9LQ08_z8tJmsyIqT_7peu-P9YgOqhO6lmsgfadh-Ot1PnKiUn-Vxjy3Vf0jxoN2QNdQirL33BwvsR629W2ZsabTOI5zfAS6p_ksokXz4NdxIA0nzCOg/s2543/Sunday+dinner+Suzy+E+and+E.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxXFiUhF82OCl-hpBCdLO9LQ08_z8tJmsyIqT_7peu-P9YgOqhO6lmsgfadh-Ot1PnKiUn-Vxjy3Vf0jxoN2QNdQirL33BwvsR629W2ZsabTOI5zfAS6p_ksokXz4NdxIA0nzCOg/w400-h195/Sunday+dinner+Suzy+E+and+E.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Reading with Elliot - last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><div style="text-align: justify;">It was a precious family moment. Later I helped Oli get him ready for bed and was happy to be back changing his nappy. Joy of joys he was to stay the night as Monday was a national holiday, the Day of Spain and neither Oli nor Miguel had to work. I bet they needed the break.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">Later I hooked onto a new series, again about WW2 and  based on a true story. Called, The Heavy Water War (Kampen om tungtvannet) it is a Norwegian production about the Nazi's efforts to develop the atomic bomb sourcing heavy water from Norway. They were dependent on the heavy water to make the atom bomb and the efforts of the Norwegian resistance based in Scotland finally thwarted its supply. This was the reason the Nazis never managed to make the terrible bomb during WW2. If they had the world would be very different today. No doubt my father knows this story well from his time in Norway as head of disarmament when the Germans were driven out of the country. </div><p style="text-align: justify;">I was up at around 7 am on Monday morning. Monday was the first time I plucked up the courage to get on the scales after 2 weeks of dieting. I was actually pleasantly surprised with the result as I hadn't put on as much weight as I had thought after all the excesses during lock down and the summer. So, I tried on my size 12 M&S jeans and wow, they fit. That really spurred me on to continue with the diet. It was wonderful to discard my leggings and wear denims for a change. I only have about 6 kilos to lose and hopefully by then I will fit into all the size 10 jeans that have been collecting dust in my wardrobe  for a long time. Watch this space!</p><p style="text-align: justify;">12th October is what is often called "El Pilar" in Spain and is a national holiday. It is not only the feast of Saint Pilar, the patron saint of Zaragoza, but also Spain's national day. It commemorates Christopher Colombus' arrival in America and it is therefore also known as Hispanic Day. Spaniards are not very good at unity nor in celebrating their national day, except for the Armed Forces. We do not have the spirit that is raised in France on 14th July or in the US on Independence Day. Only the far right were out  last Sunday waving the national flag when the Vox party held demonstrations all over the country against the current government. The Spanish flag instead of unifying the nation has a sort of fascist connotation and is associated with the far right of the political spectrum.  I always think that is a shame. It only seems to unite the country when used to fete sporting achievements such as Nadal's amazing win last Sunday. That is the only acceptable use of the flag by the mainstream population. In other countries on national days, people use their flag proudly decorating gardens and homes - think Denmark, France, Sweden, the US and the UK. Not so, I'm afraid in Spain, such a divided country. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTSquxc9aVGkLl4RCCj5NuHdmbyVjetryfUoloPeQgDRIbbF3UwdKYBCrlB4EZJjBJmPR63b7K4RROxZaFc3c_heoNb-X1oCwSnPtjsJQHztuEaXFOGnpCbYiA-hXmhKvS7WHw1Q/s1200/flag.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTSquxc9aVGkLl4RCCj5NuHdmbyVjetryfUoloPeQgDRIbbF3UwdKYBCrlB4EZJjBJmPR63b7K4RROxZaFc3c_heoNb-X1oCwSnPtjsJQHztuEaXFOGnpCbYiA-hXmhKvS7WHw1Q/w400-h225/flag.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Spain's national flag with its right wing connotations and only used acceptably to celebrate sporting victories. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sadly, the words "nothing to celebrate" (#nadaquecelebrar) were trending topic on Twitter. Oh how I hate the way Spaniards lack a sense of unity and spend most of their time criticising their wonderful country. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">At home we were just thankful it was a holiday and could enjoy the company of Olivia, Miguel and little Elliot. Thus I was able to pick him up from his cot when he woke up. I love the feel and smell of a baby, our baby, when he has just woken up. He always wakes up with a smile and kept us smiling all day long. He came for a walk with us and our three dogs which we all enjoyed as, although quite cool, it was a lovely sunny day. </p></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Lunch was another family affair, one which my father enjoyed immensely. He adores his great grandson and that makes me happy. We all had a siesta afterwards apart from the young generation. While I was taking my nap, Suzy, Oli, Miguel and Elliot were out in the sunshine. I missed the girls singing and playing the ukelele. Oli knows how to play it now. They are both so musical and there is nothing that makes me happier than to hear them singing together and always in harmony. Later Suzy showed me a video of the two of them singing an interpretation of John Lennon's famous song; "Imagine".

Soon he was in my arms just as he woke up and it was one of those delightful moments with my grandson, little Elliot, who we now call "the little boy". </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEicVrjjsnJ24NlV5mQ3jOFm8XVpiHSqj6Nh3bqm-jRSG8nTtGPkQMd1yD6qQ5-9EnZVfD-klC-et3bARfGtUgycF_EC7Aw3hYUKfyh6cWGLfSmJsNOB1uB67sTqMcRN9ulrQ2C7rg/s1598/Monday+cover+photo+me+and+Elliot.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEicVrjjsnJ24NlV5mQ3jOFm8XVpiHSqj6Nh3bqm-jRSG8nTtGPkQMd1yD6qQ5-9EnZVfD-klC-et3bARfGtUgycF_EC7Aw3hYUKfyh6cWGLfSmJsNOB1uB67sTqMcRN9ulrQ2C7rg/w225-h400/Monday+cover+photo+me+and+Elliot.jpg" width="225"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>With Elliot in my arms on Sunday just as he had woken up form his afternoon nap.</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">They had the TV on and I was delighted to see they were semi watching Gone with the wind, one of my all time favourite films. It's so long of course and soon Oli and her family had to leave. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Suzy, my darling daughter, had a meltdown when her sister and little nephew left. She has very mixed feelings about leaving Spain for Costa Rica. On the one hand she is looking forward to a new life but on the other hand she knows she is going to miss little Elliot so much, the darling of her life. I am lucky to have him near. To make her feel better, Oli suggested coming to lunch the next day. We shall also all be going together to our new house in Asturias, which the girls don't know yet, a few days before Suzy leaves and when our current guests have left. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">After a crisis I suggested a cup of tea - that all curing British habit when important things happen. So the three of us; Suzy, Eladio and I sat together in the last of the sun on the pool terrace talking about Suzy's future. Later we had dinner together and by then she had calmed down and so had we. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Tuesday came and I woke up with a headache at 5 bloody 50, excuse my language. I soon realised that Tuesday was the 13th of the month. And so what you may ask? Well, Tuesday 13th in Spain is the UK's equivalent of Friday 13th, traditionally a so-called unlucky day. Thankfully our day was not so bad. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Eladio took Norah our beagle off to the vet for her now weekly check up after her recent health problems. Meanwhile, I worked on a press release but ended up spending about 1.5h trying to send money to my daughter Suzy using Transfer Wise, a nearly commission free international money transfer service, a bit like Paypal but much cheaper for international transfers. It is not at all easy to use  but I finally managed. I also had to prepare for the arrival of a new guest. Adrian, a repeat guest came to stay on Tuesday for 4 nights. He arrived in the afternoon and was happy to be back. You may be interested to know he is a professional tattooist. That is not a profession I admire as I was brought up by my father to equate tattoos with drunken sailors. Today of course tattoos are much in fashion but I still hate them. Not Suzy though who has many on her body. She was more interested in meeting our new guest than I was haha. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Oli and Elliot were coming for lunch which would brighten up our day. But there was hardly any food in the cupboards so Tuesday ended up being food shopping day. By the time Oli and Elliot arrived the food was bought, packed away and lunch made. It was delightful to see Elliot for the third day on the trot and this time he knew where he was immediately. He wanted to be in all our arms bless him. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I immediately took him to see his great grandfather who always loves to see him. It was at that moment that my father pointed to a photo of my mother on his desk, one I had printed for him recently on the anniversary of her passing away. I was taken aback when he suddenly asked me: "Who is this woman?". Oli was with me and she was shocked too. We immediately told him it was "Mummy" and his wife. I then showed him a photo of her when she was young and Oli got out a photo of their wedding day. I think that cleared it up for him. Then at lunchtime he suddenly asked me: "Can you tell me who my children are?" I was devastated and I suppose he was too. I immediately replied that I was his daughter and that my brother had been George. He seemed placated and apologised for not remembering. Well, he is 101 and it is totally understandable but even so it was a sort of turning point. Thankfully the next day he remembered and the poor man even apologised for his lapsus. Then at lunch time I reminded him I was his daughter to which he replied "and who is your mother?" Again I brought out photos to remind him. I felt so sad. I also feel sorry for him too as very suddenly our newspaper delivery company told us that The Times was no longer distributed in Spain. It was the same for The Daily Telegraph and the only UK newspaper they could deliver was The  Financial Times which my father described as "boring".  Until now he spent his  whole morning pouring over The Times and that can no longer be which worries and upsets me. He still reads El País, the Spanish newspaper but it is not the same. To make up for this I looked for new books from my own library for him to read and found a biography of Alexander I and one on Churchill. He chose the former. I was happy to see him reading it that afternoon. His love of Russia and history are still intact and I breathed a sigh of relief. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">After this episode, in the little time left before lunch which is always strictly at 2 pm in this house, we played with Elliot  and he was delighted to be reunited with his tricycle.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIvv09S4EZqYt1wy6_Y3fMpkdocCdkKGiuc5EagnzEIN5Rwn6W0VpDINhlBrNdWh5pnmEgho-Y4TQFsBIVcXxQRztvnxAkMuTcPVAISaJCxf72-dIcEE1UlSyjNuzGsyl8mx4fOw/s2543/Tuesday+Elliot+tricycle.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIvv09S4EZqYt1wy6_Y3fMpkdocCdkKGiuc5EagnzEIN5Rwn6W0VpDINhlBrNdWh5pnmEgho-Y4TQFsBIVcXxQRztvnxAkMuTcPVAISaJCxf72-dIcEE1UlSyjNuzGsyl8mx4fOw/w400-h195/Tuesday+Elliot+tricycle.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Elliot prefers to push his tricycle to riding it hahahaha. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">He loves coming to our house and we love having him here. Oh how he brightens up our life. There is nothing comparable to grandparent love as, I imagine, all grandparents know. It's a love and feeling only to be understood when you become a grandparent.  I think my smile says it all in this week's feature photo of me holding Elliot on my lap and hugging him. He loves hugs and constantly tries to hug the other toddlers at his nursery who generally end up falling on the floor as he is rather big for his age. Hahahahaa. That day Oli sent us a photo of him at the nursery with the other toddlers.

He always poses when you call him to take a photo and usually smiles. That's probably because he has  been a little "poorly" this week with congestion and a bit of a cough and was not his usual self. We think he had a cold - God forbid Covid. Thankfully there was no temperature. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the afternoon Suzy and  I accompanied Oli and Elliot to the local health centre for a routine vaccine and check up. There was to be no vaccine though because of his "cold" until next week. The doctor measured and weighed him and he is a whopping 11 kilos measuring 79 cm. The doctor said that many babies double his age were that size. He is really big. Children's weight and length these days are measured by percentile, the average being 50%. Elliot's is 90%! He already wears clothes for a 2 year old yet he has only just turned 1. That of course may change as babies and children do not develop equally. It is an indication though that he will probably be a "big boy". </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to damned Covid, neither Suzy nor I could accompany Elliot and Oli into the clinic and had to wait outside. We did so in a sunny park with our hated masks on. The park was lovely and was full of all sorts of gym apparatus. I spied some bike pedals at the foot of some of the benches and had to try them out. Here I am when Suzy caught me on camera ahhahaha. A bit like the trampoline in the boulevard the previous week in Alicante, the child in me is always attracted to these sort of things. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0ca7lJl4O9KBXacWfmdHRp3AxjjWZQVcgwHsa5OgZTNmaPbW4j3B_F8qj75lg38V9FAKJ5DzUzfCthaR7OwDzWc0NO64ChSeh3hLcYnYFcbhMP15cQZRe5s-FSAvRQ4KOVkZKhQ/s1136/Tuesday+me+park+bike+pedals.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0ca7lJl4O9KBXacWfmdHRp3AxjjWZQVcgwHsa5OgZTNmaPbW4j3B_F8qj75lg38V9FAKJ5DzUzfCthaR7OwDzWc0NO64ChSeh3hLcYnYFcbhMP15cQZRe5s-FSAvRQ4KOVkZKhQ/w268-h400/Tuesday+me+park+bike+pedals.jpg" width="268"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Silly me trying out the bike pedals on the bench on Tuesday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">When Oli and Elliot emerged from the health centre we drove to our favourite coffee and bakery shop, -Alverán. There we had some quality mother and daughter time together while little Elliot slept. It was lovely to be out and about, something I haven't done for a while and it was wonderful to be with both girls. As Suzy's departure date for Costa Rica comes closer - 30th October - she needs that time with us and we need it with her.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We were home by about 6.30 when she had to give her weekly online English lesson to Olga, her deaf pupil and I changed into my evening wear (i.e. my pyjamas hahahhaha) and sat in the lounge reading the Edward VIII biography. Eladio joined me and soon it was time for dinner which the three of us had together with the dogs, as always, at our feet. Later Suzy and I had more quality time together and spent nearly an hour talking in her room. It was therapeutic for both of us. When I went upstairs to join Eladio in bed he was watching a stupid football match between Spain and Ukraine. I didn't give a fig about it and turned to my kindle to read more about the fascinating life of the Prince of Wales, later to become King and then the Duke of Windsor.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">On Wednesday I was awake at 6.20 in the morning. A friend had recently recommended eating 2 kiwis for dinner as kiwis are rich in serotonin and antioxidants. I read the body uses serotonin (the "happy chemical" like endorphins) to synthesise melatonin, the hormone that regulates sleep. I have tried it but am not sure it really works. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As always I watched Olivia on TV at 8 am when she is always on. I saw her many times that morning as she was still doubling her job. Thankfully her colleague who is in charge of social media was back on Thursday after her confinement. I should add she tested negative. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEijhJLmx-xIrT0_6iBttFFsKe15PxfgoTJPDFERK93NK-9rEDAMbF6T57bjHMytPazR_5tYvNc5vDbTECLL16shzv10hhURwQZVE00xIl3MwQJVrdbPSdMU5vVEDke_JINrBudL_Q/s2543/Wed+Olivia+TV.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEijhJLmx-xIrT0_6iBttFFsKe15PxfgoTJPDFERK93NK-9rEDAMbF6T57bjHMytPazR_5tYvNc5vDbTECLL16shzv10hhURwQZVE00xIl3MwQJVrdbPSdMU5vVEDke_JINrBudL_Q/w400-h195/Wed+Olivia+TV.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Olivia on TV on Wednesday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Olivia is becoming a real expert on Covid data in Spain. Each night she pours over data to report on the next morning. <br></br><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Wednesday was a quiet day all round. We only went out once and that was for our walk. I felt very tired when I got back which was unusual. I even had to lie down and sleep just before lunch. That was not normal as even though I don't sleep well at night I am never tired during the day. In the afternoon Eladio and I had planned to go to Ikea to get some cushions for the sofas at our new house in Asturias. But Eladio wasn't feeling well with all the usual symptoms of a cold. Oh God was this our Covid moment we both wondered? Thankfully we had none of the usual Covid symptoms; cough, temperature, breathing problems, lack of sense of taste or smell, etc. So instead of going out we retired to our bedroom to watch TV. Eladio had put the central heating on for the first time since before the summer and I felt very snug under my mother's home made patchwork blanket.  We finished the enthralling Norwegian series and then started on a film of a completely different genre. "Sand Storm" is set in Southern Israel and is the story of forbidden love between a Muslim girl and a Muslim boy but from a different tribe. My heart went out to them. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We stopped for dinner. A good sign was that we were both hungry. While having dinner we watched the news. Following Covid news is as addictive as the best series on TV but there is no happy ending. The news that day was dire. In France with over 22 thousand new cases that day, Macron called for a new state of emergency and imposed curfew on  Paris and many other cities with all that implies. Barcelona also went into partial lock down with the closure of restaurants and bars causing havoc with the hospitality industry. Even Asturias, the shining example of how to deal with the virus, the local government there told the population to isolate in their homes. The figures are still low in that region but on the rise. We hope that doesn't mean we wont' be able to go next week.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">That night Eladio whose cold was worse than mine - not sure I ever had one - fell asleep really soon after the news. Thus I could choose to watch whatever I wanted and in English on either Netflix or Prime Video. I guiltily watched "Fifty shades darker" - obviously a film Eladio would have hated - and thoroughly enjoyed it.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I was up at 6.35 on Thursday. It was to be a quiet day, a day when Eladio and I didn't feel 100% and which had me worrying about Covid. But I had good news early in the day. Finally, Hacienda, the Spanish equivalent of the Inland Revenue, had paid my tax returns. They should have done so back in July and I was beginning to worry they were doing a check on my accounts. That was a great relief. It was soon tempered though by a call from my accountant to tell me the amount I had to pay in tax for the third quarter (July, August and September) which amounted to a third of the tax returns. Dammit. I indulged myself and celebrated by buying 3 DVDs on Amazon of films I want to see again and which are not available online. They were: Gone with the Wind, Dr. Zhivago and Gandhi. These three films along with The Sound of Music are my top four ever. They all mean a lot to me. It was after seeing Gandhi many years ago that Eladio and I were inspired to visit India for our 25th wedding anniversary some 10 years ago. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Feeling a bit under the weather, we skipped our walk that morning. I cooked instead. Needing some lemons to make artichokes I had to drop what I was doing and drive to Mercadona to get some and a few other items of course as one never goes to a supermarket just to buy one thing. I'm sure you agree. Oli surprised us by coming for lunch again but without Elliot. She preferred not to interrupt his eating and sleeping routine at the nursery. It was funny to have her alone. She left soon after lunch though to return to what she calls "her men". We would see her and Elliot and Miguel this weekend again.  At 16.30 I had an appointment for the last of the tests for my annual "MOT" (aka annual gynecological check up). This was for a bone density scan. I think it measures the minerals in bones and detects osteoporosis. I got the results the next day in my health app but couldn't interpret them. I will have to wait to find out when I see my gynecologist next month.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I was home quite soon to find a woman called Inma visiting who I did not know. Believe it or not she was looking for accommodation. Someone had sent her here. She told me she thought our house was like a palace. I was flattered. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Later Suzy and I started on Gone with the Wind until it was time for dinner. Neither Eladio nor I slept well that night because of our colds or at least we thought we had a cold. Time will tell.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I was awake with a headache at 7 am on Friday morning - not bad for me. After my first cup of coffee it soon went and I was able to concentrate on things I had to do. I had  a sudden task when my London publisher sent me the near to final manuscript of my father's book. They have been so slow - like caterpillars. I immediately sat down to go through it and thankfully there were very few things to correct. I sent it back within the hour. Again we didn't go for a walk as both of us were still feeling under the weather. Because of this I decided the best thing to do was to rest in bed and watch a film. I watched the Professor and the Madman starring Mel Gibson and Sean Penn and loved every minute of it. It's based on a true story.

We are hardly every joined by Suzy as at around our lunch time she is giving her online lessons to Chinese children. Our lunch time is nearly their dinner time. When she goes to Costa Rica she has worked out that because of the time difference her classes will begin at about 5 in the morning! </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Oli of course gets up even earlier at 4.30 but her day finishes at about 13h or so. She came in the afternoon with little Elliot to brighten up our lives and because later we would be going out to dinner together - whoopee, we haven't done that for a long time. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The girls had to do one of those damned birthday videos which have become so popular. They like doing them though. This one was for Chati, Elenita's younger sister who turned 34 on Friday. There could be no birthday party - those days are over. Suzy rummaged in our  chest full of disguises we have collected over the years. She found some baby outfits and soon both she, Oli and Elliot were wearing them hahahhaha. What a laugh. Here they are about to have the video taken by me.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEganm9vqf3Mdc9kYA0nbXoVcAkTBtsNUtQba-ppK_n5ve5izNttJXPQZ08dbbV8u5tKeiMafHtNmUikmQ2RSV2agIlEvjUNNXQ4icttyHcBGVTrshT2YWutYAQ1FOZIuXmbfENwng/s2543/Friday+baby+0utfits+Oli+Suzy+and+Elliot.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEganm9vqf3Mdc9kYA0nbXoVcAkTBtsNUtQba-ppK_n5ve5izNttJXPQZ08dbbV8u5tKeiMafHtNmUikmQ2RSV2agIlEvjUNNXQ4icttyHcBGVTrshT2YWutYAQ1FOZIuXmbfENwng/w400-h195/Friday+baby+0utfits+Oli+Suzy+and+Elliot.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Fun with the girls and Elliot</i></td></tr></tbody></table>It was the huge dummies that came with the outfits that had us laughing most. Later we found a sunny spot in the garden and sat on Elliot's play mat together. Suzy played the ukelele and we sang songs like Imagine and Let it Be until it got too cold. We retired to the library lounge - often called the "cat lounge" because that's where Phoebe, our elusive cat, comes in the mornings for her food. Elliot was asleep for a while but soon woke up and we enjoyed his company. He is so funny these days, saying "papa" all the time while putting his hand or an object to his ear as if he were speaking on the phone. He is so attracted to remote controls and phones. Suzy took this lovely photo of him. Isn't he gorgeous?</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjeqV-NCNyJD7QSR4FYJZFGCudas-7kSNCiMsvoc6V0rmRpi-LcrWwvVK_JIbIopC7ZEzwlGa0JUhiffub5BRwbFE5ZIviLxIZNTOfnNHtc27fSoixxMe4ASgaXHAVVDA7jnxkAbQ/s1599/Friday+Elliot+pm+lounge+photo+by+Suzy.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjeqV-NCNyJD7QSR4FYJZFGCudas-7kSNCiMsvoc6V0rmRpi-LcrWwvVK_JIbIopC7ZEzwlGa0JUhiffub5BRwbFE5ZIviLxIZNTOfnNHtc27fSoixxMe4ASgaXHAVVDA7jnxkAbQ/w225-h400/Friday+Elliot+pm+lounge+photo+by+Suzy.jpg" width="225"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Elliot on Friday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We all had plans that night. Suzy was going to Elenita's house and Eladio, Oli and her family and I were going out to dinner. We had booked a table at the Moroccan joint near us, El Tuareg. Eladio was worried about sitting inside but I wasn't as the tables were very spread and the doors wide open. Thankfully I went warmly dressed. We love the food there and usually order the same, starting always with humus and pita bread and ending with mint tea and baklava. We even brought some back for Suzy. Olivia had found 150 euros in her knicker draw in an envelope. She was so delighted to have found the money that she treated us all to the dinner. How can you lose 150 euros I wondered? It turns out it was my father's Christmas money to her from last year. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We were home by about 11 and while Oli and Miguel put Elliot in his cot, we retired to our room. I was a bit tired and cannot remember for the life of me what we watched. I was awake at 3, then 4 and 5 am and finally got up at 6.22. I was down first and thus fed the dogs before having my first cup of coffee. <br></br><div><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;">I was shocked to read that a young Russian terrorist from Chechenia, had beheaded French school teacher, Samuel Paty, just outside Paris. The teacher had included cartoons of Mohammed in a class about freedom of expression. That was his crime. That is no crime but some Muslim fanatics think it is. France and the world were shocked. I was too. What a dreadful thing to happen, how barbaric can you get?</div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i><br></br></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was lovely to have Elliot with us again that day but it wasn't for long. In fact, soon I was pretty much alone. The girls had gone to have "girly time" and lunch together, Miguel had taken Elliot to his parents' house for lunch and Eladio went to have the Volvo serviced. Thus I went on my walk in brilliant sunshine listening to my favourite classical music from one of my Spotify lists. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The highlight of the afternoon was a Skype call with Sandra and Adele, my University friends. You probably know Sandra lives in Brussels and Adele in France. Here is a photo of them during our call.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQBKepqFnt-5z-ASvXrObKF_mSqi2MTkaW2PkqF9pe0V6NO1yqlYuZsZY7VChb4SjkocgTqWgeodOoeK2C7lNQUX2oXLeGs3A9qpEhBk4io7JfnjTlep1Gj-bF9MzCvsv_StjzNQ/s2543/Sat+skype+call.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQBKepqFnt-5z-ASvXrObKF_mSqi2MTkaW2PkqF9pe0V6NO1yqlYuZsZY7VChb4SjkocgTqWgeodOoeK2C7lNQUX2oXLeGs3A9qpEhBk4io7JfnjTlep1Gj-bF9MzCvsv_StjzNQ/w400-h195/Sat+skype+call.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Yesterday's Skype call with my dear friends Adele and Sandra</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;">We had lots to catch up on. Sandra's dear mother, 96 year old Magda had been taken into hospital recently suffering from a lack of sodium which had left her very confused. Thankfully she is home again and better. We greeted her during the call. Being from Europe's Covid hotspots, France, Belgium and Spain and with our British descent, our conversation focused a lot on the latest figures and measures for these countries.  I was shocked to find out later that that day France recorded the largest increase in cases in any one day since March with more than 32 thousand cases. The UK reported about 16 thousand and little Belgium nearly 9 thousand. Even Italy hit 10 thousand. None of us can see the end coming soon. It's dire to live through. Adele is a University teacher and is hating her job at the moment as most of the lectures are online. I can understand that. For years now we have seen each other at least twice a year either in Brussels, Italy, London, France or Spain but because of Covid this year's reunion is a foregone conclusion. I wonder when we will next meet in the flesh. I do so love these "girls". </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I love my girls too and when we finished our Skype call, it was time to make dinner with them. Elliot and Miguel came just when the table was laid. Oli had bought all sorts of enticing (i.e. fattening) items for dinner but I kept to salad and hams. Oh, but I did have half a glass of the wonderful Luis Cañas Reserva wine she also bought. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Eladio and I were in bed by about 9.30 and watched the tail end of the news and later turned to Netflix as there is so much rubbish on terrestrial TV. There's a lot of rubbish on Netflix and Prime Video, you have to separate the wheat from the chaff and there's a lot more chaff than wheat, at least for us. </div></div></div></div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Today is Sunday and everyone is here but by lunchtime Oli and family will have gone and the house will be quite. I think it will be a quiet day too as Sunday's usually are. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I am now at the end of the tales of this week. I wish you all the very best until next Sunday. If things go according to plan, I shall be writing from our new house in Asturias.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cheers everyone until then,</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Masha</div>
