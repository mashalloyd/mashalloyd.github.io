Spain where we have been on holiday now for a week. We have no return date and
are enjoying every day. Here with us now are Suzy who came with us and Oli and
family who arrived on Wednesday.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It was very quiet before they came and<b> last</b> <b>Sunday
</b>was quiet too, unlike today with all of Eladio’s family here. We counted 42
people yesterday!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">That day Suzy and I walked to Murias which little Elliot,
bless him, calls Murcia, a big town just south of Alicante, hahaha. Our prize
was coffee at the local prison, now turned into a hotel and restaurant. I love
having coffee in the garden there with beautiful views of the mountains. It’s
so peaceful. Everything is peaceful around here and this week, I have hardly
followed the news. Here is a photo of Suzy enjoying time with me.<o:p></o:p></p>

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhaYuSDuENVjBaRadZ9z6yodRkB3lJIygJv6twY1OzFU2FaW1LsqbBEFS_JDFKVLqvVpqHZM7O-KVAWnsQ0eXvQGNtNmOhNu2ve1x4DoDMiFMmUXROkvc6bZQWHbx8mYGl9FLKtPXehEm0VdgG_dWyfV-GUdC4EoxT_8CQvOlm9IoNHG1AMqkdx-A/s4000/20250727_120451.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1848" data-original-width="4000" height="185" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhaYuSDuENVjBaRadZ9z6yodRkB3lJIygJv6twY1OzFU2FaW1LsqbBEFS_JDFKVLqvVpqHZM7O-KVAWnsQ0eXvQGNtNmOhNu2ve1x4DoDMiFMmUXROkvc6bZQWHbx8mYGl9FLKtPXehEm0VdgG_dWyfV-GUdC4EoxT_8CQvOlm9IoNHG1AMqkdx-A/w400-h185/20250727_120451.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Coffee with Suzy in Murias</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><p class="MsoNormal">I have spent nearly all my time with her this week. She has
had her ups and downs but overall, it has done her so much good to be here;
better than any professional therapy. &nbsp;I
have hardly left her side and we have talked endlessly about her progress. Here
she has reconnected with her roots and family. Montrondo is in our souls and
the girls have wonderful memories of long summers spent here with their cousins
when they were young. It is wonderful to watch Juliet and Elliot creating early
memories of Montrondo too. They love it here as much as Suzy and Oli did when
they were children.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Later I accompanied her to mass in the village but had to
stay outside with Pippa. Mass here is the big weekly social event and people
dress up in their Sunday best and enjoy greeting the other church goers.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We spent the afternoon together on the sun loungers under
the shade of the ancient apple trees. Eladio joined us for another walk to
Murias in the early evening where we greeted many people from both Murias and
Montrondo. This walk is the meeting point for everyone who lives here too or
comes to stay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On our way back Suzy and I went to buy eggs from a local
farmer and had fried eggs for dinner. Eggs here taste better than any you can
get from a supermarket as you can imagine. My sister-in-law who has to feed 14
every day, buys dozens and dozens!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Monday </b>was a quiet day again which I spent being with
Suzy. She has made huge progress coming here and I am proud of her. That day I
continued my fight with Movistar, our fibre provider. There was a connection
fault in the fibre box in the street which only affected our house in Madrid. I
was getting nowhere until I tweeted the head of customer service who I happened
to know. Thanks to him, internet was restored by Tuesday afternoon. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Again Suzy and I spent the afternoon under the apple trees
with Pippa by our side, as usual. We also spent time with Eladio’s family; some
of his brothers and sisters and their families were here too. As we did on
Monday, we went for an early evening walk followed by a simple dinner and then
early to bed. Sometimes we were in bed by 9 pm, hahaha.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Tuesday</b> came and we were running out of supplies, as
was Dolores, so the three of us drove to Villablino, the nearest town.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The highlight was coffee with Eladio’s
sister, Adela and her husband Primo. Here is a photo to remember the moment.<o:p></o:p></p>

something and the mini type freshly fried donuts we were served were divine</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We made more coffee in the afternoon and invited all the
family in the front garden which we call “el corral”. It was quite an effort to
make coffee for so many with just one Nespresso machine but it was worth it as
a good time was had by all. Suzy helped me of course as she has done all week,
preparing meals most days.<o:p></o:p></p>

school house where Eladio used to go. It’s not much of a bar, but a great place
to meet people. Suzy made progress again when she went there and reconnected
with friends from her childhood. One of the boys brought along a whole album of
photos of their youth in Montrondo. I was intrigued with one by God’s rock (la
peña de Diós) taken in 2012, thirteen years ago where we all look so much&nbsp; younger. Let me share it with you.</p>

nights and so great to have escaped the heat of Madrid where, this week, it has
reached 40ºc. Montrondo which is 1300m high never gets that kind of heat.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Wednesday </b>dawned and brought with it a booking from
Alaska of all places. I have been running my little business from here and
sometimes it’s a challenge as there is no fibre in the village. And damn it,
yesterday all coverage went at around 4 pm and we didn’t know when it would be
restored. It was funny to be totally isolated from the world and not good for
my business. Suzy and I spent a lot of the morning making lunch for Oli and
family who were arriving that morning but there was also time for coffee in
Senra at the grumpy man’s bar. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The family arrived just in time for lunch and it was great
to be reunited here. They had been on holiday in the French Basque country and
in Cantabria but I knew my grandchildren would be at their happiest here,
reunited with their little cousins. Elliot, although he doesn’t express his
feelings very well, was very excited to be here in what he now considers his
village. What he loves most is the freedom to ride his bike anywhere. I caught
him on camera with a huge smile on his face.<o:p></o:p></p>

reunions, for Suzy, who hasn’t been here for 8 years, were sweet to watch.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After dinner for which Suzy had made watermelon gazpacho, we
all went for a shorter walk and later I spent time with Oli. Since they came, I
have been going to bed later.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The girls and I went to have coffee in Murias. Juliet joined
us and had a bit of a tantrum but soon calmed down when we came back to the
village. Apart from enjoying the bicycles – Juliet learned how to ride one this
week<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>- the smaller kids love the
trampoline where they spend hours jumping up and down. <o:p></o:p></p>

grumpy man’s bar whose wife makes great food. It was the highlight of the day.
Later, of course, I, at least felt too full for dinner.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the afternoon, while I lay under the apple trees the
girls made apple crumble but with apples bought at Gadis in Villablino. They
were following a tradition I had started when they were young as I always used
to make it and we all love it.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Lots of people went to the newly opened bar which is nothing
special but it’s a place where all the young people can meet. More and more
people were arriving for the annual Santa Marta fiestas this Saturday and the
village came to life. I actually prefer it when there are fewer people. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Our day ended with a short walk after a very small dinner;
in my case.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Friday</b> was 1<sup>ST</sup> August. We had to do more
food shopping and it took a while to collect my fellow shoppers. Dolores was
coming and we had to wait until at least 11 until Oli was free of her kids. I
came home to make yet another 3 course lunch for 7 which has been a bit of a
challenge this week but it’s lovely for us all to be around the table together.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It was on Friday that Eladio and I finally visited the bar
and saw the kids and people gathering under the huge marquee built for the

had to have a photo.<o:p></o:p></p>

field (El Campo) here and took some photos; one of which I have chosen to
illustrate this week’s blog post. Here is one of Eladio by the village well
where everyone used to get water in the old days before pipes were laid. What
hard times they endured.</p>

to Murias and back but only Suzy and I made it to the next village together
with Pippa.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Yesterday, <b>Saturday</b> was the fiesta of Santa Marta,
the patron saint of Montrondo and the whole family was together. I was up at
6.30, as usual and by 7.30 was preparing the lunch. I had chosen to make a
Portuguese dish called “Bacalhua a bras” which is basically scrambled eggs with
cod and onion and takes hours to make. I made time though to go with Eladio to
the village church for mass at 12.30.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have never seen the&nbsp;
18<sup>th</sup> century village church so full of people. The mass was
good because the priest did a good job. At one point he wanted a photo with all
the children by the altar and one of everyone in the church. I obliged as I
think I was probably the best person to do the job.</p>

stew which I served on the first day and which my husband loves. Internet was
not back and Juliet didn’t understand how she couldn’t watch Peppa Pig. The
dance in the marquee wasn’t starting until 11.30 pm which is far too late for
me. Thus Eladio and I went to bed.&nbsp; There
was no internet on our phones to entertain us but more worryingly I couldn’t
check in my new guests in El Cuetu&nbsp; nor
could I be in touch with them to see whether they had arrived ok.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Today is <b>Sunday</b> and internet is not back. Thus I’m
not sure when I will be able to publish today’s blog post. I shall have to
drive a few kilometres away to another village where I have heard there is some
coverage. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Today will be another family day in Montrondo all together
just as I like it.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I shall leave you now to have breakfast, get changed and
drive down the road to see whether I can publish this. I do hope internet comes
back soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We can’t live without it can
we?<o:p></o:p></p>
