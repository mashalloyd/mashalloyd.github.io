<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Good morning everyone.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">It's Sunday again and I'm still baching it as  Eladio is still in Montrondo looking after his Mother. Our separation has its ups and downs. I am certainly missing him and of course have needed him on many  occasions when things have gone wrong in the house and garden.I have also needed him when the gate to the street broke down, the pool needed cleaning and  to  carry my Father in his wheelchair up the path which is very steep and I can hardly do it even with Lucy. Lucy, by the way is better, thank goodness and things for the moment seem nearly back to normal. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Last Sunday I was baching it with Olivia who had been so supportive since Eladio left, especially helping me with my Father while Lucy was out of action and being bolshie. I think last weekend if I had had a replacement I would have fired her but I didn't. I think she thinks she is indispensable but actually there are a lot of people out there who would want her job. The downside of changing carers is the difficult learning curve and adapting and integrating into our household. So, at least for the moment and probably until the end of the summer we shall not make any changes.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">That was an error as it was far to hot. Norah protested and kept stopping to rest in the shady spots. We all came back hot and bothered and I needed a second shower that morning. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Oli would be leaving that night and from then on I was baching it alone and could not take all three dogs on the walk. I felt very guilty shutting Norah and Elsa in the kitchen after having bribed them with doggy treats and then waltzing off with Pippa and my headphones. They will have to wait now until Eladio is back, poor things. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We spent the afternoon in the garden while our Dutch guests were enjoying their last day by the pool. Before Oli left we made a delicious dinner of asparagus with "lacón" (cooked ham) Galician style followed by fresh figs and thick black cherries. After I saw her off I spent time with Annelise, the Mother of the Dutch family, a primary school teacher in Holland. They have enjoyed our house enormously and we enjoyed their company. Sweetly they later posted me a 5 star review. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Later that night I watched Invictus (for the first time) and this time I was able to watch a film in English on terrestrial TV after Oli had shown me which button to press on the remote hahaha. It does make a difference. One of the main advantages of Eladio being away are that I can watch what I want and I can watch it in English.  The downsides of his being away or me "baching it" alone were of course his house and garden maintenance skills but also the lack of his company. I would have needed him too on Monday morning to take me to the hospital for my eye operation and bring me back as I would not be allowed to drive. I was going to take a taxi (it's quiet far) when I thought of ringing my friend Fátima, on the off chance she would be in town. Well she was and would be here all week. Thus she agreed to accompany me the next day to the hospital. She would be a great help all the week. Thank you my dearest friend. We had good quality time together as you will read. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Monday came, my big day. I was a bit scared of another eye operation, this time a laser one to correct the astigmatism that the cataract surgery had not resolved in my left eye. Unbelievably for me I was awake at 7.20 - that's really late for me. I had the kitchen patio to myself and the dogs. There would be no walk that morning for any of us.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">After saying goodbye to my Dutch family who were off to the Basque Country, Fátima soon arrived to pick me up. My operation was at 11.30 and we were then well on time. The operation didn't start until 12. It may be a simpler operation to the cataract surgery but the downside of laser surgery on the eye is that they don't put you to sleep. You can feel everything although it doesn't hurt. They cover your eye completely and then open the rubber covering so only your eyeball is visible. The surgeon put something in my eye to keep the eyelids open and eye drops were poured on constantly. You feel a lot of pressure and then smell the  burning from the laser treatment. I didn't know what they were cutting but it didn't feel good.  Soon it was over and I was told to open my eyes although I could not see anything but shadows out of my left eye. I then had to stay in the waiting room with Fátima with my eye closed for 2 hours after which one of they eye specialists would check that the operation had gone well. It had gone well, thankfully but I still don't know whether I will recover full vision. Right now as I write, without glasses, there is still a fuzzy feeling in my left eye. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We came home and had lunch together,  a late one without my Father and then went upstairs for a siesta with Pippa. Believe it or not I then slept for 2 full hours, something I never do. I felt better afterwards although my eye did hurt all day. Later I went to see my Father to tell him how everything had gone and he told me had been praying for me, bless him. I asked him if he really believed in God to which he replied " I cannot not believe in God". He said that was because his Father was an Anglican vicar and that he gone to church every Sunday. He mentioned  communion wine hahaha. I told him I found it difficult to believe. It was an interesting conversation.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">So Monday was not the best of days. It was much worse elsewhere in the world. I have nothing to complain about. That day in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/jul/25/how-the-fires-in-mati-greece-spread-a-visual-guide">Greece, in the coastal area near Athens wild fires</a> occurred, the worst in a century.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">The death toll is over 80, not to mention the houses and vehicles lost. It's a dreadful story, not least because later we heard it was caused by arson; one man provoked it. There have been wild fires and forest fires in many parts of Europe including Sweden where they are nearly unheard of. That's because of the heatwave in Northern Europe. In England this week it reached the high 30's something the country is totally unprepared for. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">On Tuesday my eye felt better. It no longer itched or hurt although I still couldn't see well at all.  Dear sweet Fátima came to take me to the hospital for a next day check up. That was quick and easy. I shall be going back in the middle of August. Hopefully, by then, my vision will have improved. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">On our way back, I took Fátima to my cheap dress shop, "Avanti" in Boadilla where there are garments for 10 euros. It's where I got my "Bereber" trousers from. I bought a lovely spotted dress I had seen when I went with Olivia and love it, even though it shows my arms and all the wrinkles. But it's very cool to wear in this heat as well as sort of romantic.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Oli had gone on holiday to Galicia with her boyfriend Miguel.  They went that morning and will be back tonight. They have gone to completely different weather as up there it is a bit like England. Tuesday saw them in Lugo, a town I have never visited but will soon I know for sure and for work purposes. Her boyfriend is as great photographer being a TV cameraman so we are spoiled for good quality family photos. Here is my stunning younger daughter in Lugo on Tuesday.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">On Tuesday we had the house to ourselves. Our next Airbnb guests were not arriving until Wednesday, a couple from France. That day the professional photographer sent me the Airbn photos I had been given for free as a bonus for being a super host four quarters in a row.

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">That evening, as part of my "baching it" week, I had invited Fátima and our good friend Juliio for dinner. They were supposed to come for a swim at 7 but Julio couldn't make it until dinner time. It was to be Fátima's first bathe of the season.

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I was mesmerised by him and the series which is very well done. My Father asked me what he was most famous for and I think it's for his theory that seems to disprove some of  Newton's laws on general relativity. Don't ask me to explain that.  He was a revolutionary of his time and a true genius. But he is also famous for some amazing equation (mass energy equivalence forma E=mc2) dubbed the world's most famous equation.  I encourage you to watch it. He was the most famous scientist of his time and a Jew living in Berlin when Hitler came to power and his life as a man and a scientist is absolutely fascinating. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">On Wednesday I was busy with work. This week I had to prepare a press release for Adamo which was to go out on Friday morning, never a good day for press but that was the day of the signing of a deal which was to be the subject of the release. It had me busy every morning this week apart from the day of my operation. </span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">But I had time for some errands too. I went to see my Father's doctor to get him some prescriptions and also to the gourmet Carrefour, recently opened here to get a box of thick black cherries, fresh fish and pork ribs. I came home to make baked hake with garlic and basil from the garden accompanied by brocoli, potatoes and my father's favourite vegetable, cauliflower.  It was while my Father was finishing his lunch that I asked Lucy for help to pick some of the greengages from the tree which looked ripe. I brought up Eladio's aluminium ladder from his sacred tool room by the garage and between us we managed to pick at least 2 kilos. We couldn't manage the rest as they are far too high up. I hope some will still be there when my husband comes back but, no doubt, by then the birds will have eaten them all. These were the ones we picked. </span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Some were hard and some were soft. We left the hard ones to ripen and tasted some of the soft ones and my goodness they were delicious. I'm actually not sure whether they are really greengages or just green plums. When I showed them to my Father he said "reine claude" which is what they are called in French. In Spanish they are "reina claudia". God knows what the fruit has to do with Queen Claudia. But they are not "reine claude" which are smaller and darker, like the ones we used to have in our garden in Ruskington (Lincolnshire) when I was a child. There is something romantic and bucolic about picking fruit from your own garden and I loved picking the greengages or plums that day as well as eating them.</span></div>

They had come to look for accommodation for their daughter who will be studying at the UEM University. They tentatively asked whether she could rent a room here but I said no as I get much more from Airbn than from long term rentals. It was their first Airbnb experience and it must have been good as later they gave me 5 stars and asked if they could come again in September.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">James Rhodes is in love with Spain and claims it has given him a whole new lease of life. He is an advocate for everything Spanish, especially food and I follow him on Twitter while he is learning the language. He has become a sort of hero in this country and is on a mission to make misguided Spaniards see just what a wonderful country they live in. This might surprise you but I totally subscribe to everything he says about Spain because he and I agree that Spaniards have one big inferiority complex about their country and spend their time complaining about life here. They don't see the good things and there are many. You should read this <a href="https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/05/18/inenglish/1526643992_376726.html">article written by him (in English) in El País</a>. I love the headline: "I have no reason to lie when I tell you that everything is better in Spain". </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">His story is horrific but at the same time uplifting. It is also different to a normal biography because he accompanies each chapter with music by famous composers and what that music meant to him. For example he fell in love with music when he first heard Bach's "chaconne". He has hooked me because each time he describes music which means a lot to him, I look it up on You Tube and this week have been listening to some of it on Spotify on my walks. Wow thanks James or Jimmy as your friends call you, for introducing me to some new classical music and the meaning behind the different pieces. I admire you profoundly.</span></div>

I had dinner on my own, another downside of being separated from Eladio. While eating alone I felt for people who live alone and have to eat every meal by themselves. I don't think I could do that. </span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I made scrambled eggs on toast, the nearest to healthy comfort food I know and something I often make when I'm not feeling inspired about dinner. Later I took Pippa to bed with me; she is Eladio's substitute and loves sleeping on his pillows hahaha. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Thursday came, the half way mark of my separation with Eladio. Really all these days without him have been all about getting through them until he comes home. But I had to get on with life and be productive. I continued my routines and Thursday morning saw me on my walk again with little Pippa. I always take her on a lead as on her first walks with us when she was a puppy she would run off into the bushes and not come back. On Thursday I decided to let her off her lead and see how she behaved. Well, she got 10 out of 10 for behaviour  as she never strayed from the path or from my side. From that day onward she would walk loose every day. It made me happy for her. Here she is happily walking along the dry path.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I came home to have a second shower even though we had left early. By 9.30 it's hot I can tell you although not as hot as last year when it was constantly in the very high 30's and reached 40ºc and more.  I did more work that day, the final touches of the press release and logistics for it going out on Friday. By lunchtime I was free and after a siesta and a bit of the Genius series, I went out to the garden again to continue reading James Rhodes' book and listen to some of the music he recommends. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Fátima came in the early evening to help me clean the pool. It had to be clean and ready for our English guests coming the next day; Luella and her brood from Northamptonshire  were repeat guests; lovely ones I can tell you. But they were coming mainly for the pool and it needed cleaning. Eladio had cleaned it when he left but that was a week before. We rang him to get instructions which were actually quite easy to follow. What was not so easy was getting the tube of the swimming pool hoover type device into the hole in the pool. But Fátima helped. Without her help I don't think I could have done the job. But between us we did. I chose the photo of me cleaning the pool for the first time in my life as this week's main photo as it was quite an achievement on my part. I have to say though that Fátima did more than me. She is used to living on her own and has to deal with all the maintenance stuff by herself always and I, of course, rely on my husband for nearly everything. Thursday showed me that I could actually do some of the work he does. </span></div>

They had also left the light on in the pool WC!!! I Before retiring to bed I rang Eladio and then later chatted on Whatsapp with Luella. Her little boy, Brody, who is a darling (aged 7) had told her he was too excited to sleep that night. I fell in love with that little boy last year and I think the feeling is mutual.</span></div>

That day they were in a town called Viveiro and then visited the most northerly point in Spain, "Estaca de Bares". I had heard the name many times and hope to go there one day. Galicia is one of my favourite parts of Spain.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I then went to bed with Pippa and I suppose in a way, Albert Einstein, who, by the way, was a  great lover of women as I learned from the series. The love of his life was   Mileva Maric, a Serbian mathematician. She was the first and only woman among Einstein's fellow students at the Zurich Poyltechnic. In fact in the entrance exam only she got higher marks than him. Her career which could have been brilliant was cut short by motherhood for which she was not made out. Einstein pursued his career which she helped him with but she was forever frustrated at not being able to carve out a career for herself. She complained about it to  Marie Curie  and the famous French woman scientist told her that she had abandoned her children for her career and that at least Mileva's children loved her. What a story and how hard for women in those days. No doubt had Mileva been able to pursue her career she would also have won a Nobel Prize, although maybe not as women scientists were frowned upon. Marie Curie only got her Nobel Prize when her husband Pierre rejected his unless it was also given to his wife. There, you have it a fascinating story which has had me up late every night. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">On Friday I was up early. Off I went for my walk with Pippa, off her lead and was back well on time for the sending of the press release. The story is that Adamo, the Swedish owned fiber optic operator who I do communications for, had bought Knet an operator in the Rioja area - yes the area where the famous wine comes from. They signed the deal that morning and we announced that between the acquisition and network deployment Adamo would be investing 10 million euros in the area; no mean figure. They will be deploying in areas where there is no fast internet, part of the company's strategy. To accompany the press release, I had arranged for a photo to be taken of the signing of the deal. It's always important to send a relevant photo to the press with a press release, otherwise your news only comes out in black print. This was the photo.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">And this was the <a href="https://www.adamo.es/press-releases/adamo-adquiere-operador-riojano-knet/">press release</a> I had drafted and worked on all week (in Spanish): I was to see immediate results. These days news is pretty immediate and although this wasn't major news of any kind, it was interesting to some media. The Spanish news agency, Agencia Efe, took it up which is where most of the news came from. So I was pleased. It also came out in the local written press in Logroño the next day. So, a job well done. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">At about 4 0'clock when I was fast asleep my English family arrived, 6 of them and a 7th to come today. It was lovely to greet Luella, her partner Brent, her sister Alyssa, her 14 year old daughter Mia and her friend Maya (Mia and Maya hahha) but above all it was great to see Brody again who immediately gave me a cuddle. He's such a sweetie. Before they had even settled in, he was in the pool which he had been so excited about. When this family came last year they spent nearly the whole time at our house not even visiting Madrid. I think the answer there is that English kids are not used to so much heat and an available pool and that is the attraction. Spaniards nearly all have access to a pool even if it's not their own and it's no big deal here. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">They went out food shopping and I went out too to see my doctor to get my bi monthly sleeping tablet prescription. Without them I would have no quality sleep at all. Dinner was alone again and this time I made no effort and just ate fruit and yogurt.  I went to bed early with Pippa. On Friday night I was looking forward to seeing the <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/amp/lunar-eclipse-rare-blood-moon-will-be-visible-in-the-uk-tonight-11449716?__twitter_impression=true">lunar eclipse</a>, apparently the longest one this century. I went out and out again to the terrace in my bedroom but somehow missed it. My guests did see it though. I would look again on Saturday night too. Yesterday night I finally got to see it. The night before it must have been covered by the trees: I saw it but it wasn't bloody or orange, just big and bright. I caught it on camera the best I could and this is the result.</span><br></br>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">On Friday I finished the series on Einstein and now I am sorely missing Albert. What an amazing man. He died in the USA in 1955 after escaping there from Nazi Germany in the 30's but was forever pursued by that nasty man J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the FBI who was convinced Einstein was a communist. In fact he was really rather apolitical and appalled by the Atom bomb which he wanted to have nothing to do with.  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Saturday came and I was up early and had been and come back from my walk with Pippa all before my English family had even got up. I do wish I could sleep long like them. I gave them a cup of tea before they headed for the market in nearby Majadahonda which may well be one of their few trips away from the house.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">In Montrondo yesterday it was the Santa Marta fiesta and the annual family gathering or annual family lunch. I am actually glad I am not there as I far prefer Montrondo when it is quiet.  I shall be going though sometime in August when there are fewer people. Eladio told me this year there wasn't a family lunch so I haven't missed much. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Saturday was a quiet day. I had lunch with my Father and made fish and chips. I am a bit fed up with healthy food and we hadn't had chips for ages so I thought we deserved it. We all loved yesterday's lunch.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I spent the afternoon reading and writing this blog and once again I would have dinner alone. I made scrambled eggs again. I can't wait for Eladio to come back as dinners are usually the highlight of the day but not when I am on my own. Later we talked on the phone and my dear husband told me he was getting through the days just waiting to come home. So am I. I think it's the longest time we have ever been apart since before we married. He'll be here on Wednesday 1st August and I just can't wait to fold into his arms and get back to normal life.  </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Today is Sunday, the last day of this blog. Today Oli and Miguel will be back from their travels in Galicia and I will see Oli tonight after she drops Miguel off at the Atocha train station to return to Valencia. We will be together tomorrow all day after which she will be leaving again, this time to Vitoria to see Copi. </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I woke up this morning to news of an earthquake in Lombok a tourist island in Indonesia not far from Bali where Suzy is living (25km). 20 people had died! God was I worried and rang her immediately. Thankfully she is fine, was on the beach and hadn't felt or noticed the earthquake although her colleagues who were in bed had. The last thing I wanted to hear was that Suzy was involved in a natural disaster and from afar. So I sighed a huge breath of relief and thanked God for her safety. You see when it comes to the crunch my belief in God gets stronger. I suppose that is very normal.  </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">And so my friends, that's it for this week which as you will have read has had its ups and downs. That's life and as Suzy told me on the phone today I should follow the advice I always gave to my daughters when they were young: when the going gets tough be positive. She's right. I should be. </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">On that note, I will love you and leave you now until next Sunday.</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Hope you are all enjoying the summer. Happy reading, </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Much love Masha</span></div>
