Kate Middleton, the missing Princess of Wales due to a stomach operation clouded in mystery, made the news that the day and all because of a seemingly innocent photo with her children she posted on social media. There has been a lot of speculation around her illness and why she isn't back in public service. I suppose posting the photo was her way of saying she is ok and I'm sure she is. I'm sure she just needs some rest. What she didn't need was world wide coverage and criticism that the photo had been doctored in some way. I mean don't we all edit our photos on our phones in an amateur way? The story got bigger and bigger so poor Kate had to issue a statement justifying the editing. Even The Times had a go at examining the photo with a magnifying glass. Just look. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhVVEoi17MeQD4accwhvNhO2iMw0W3VxXAT0TsVuh1PkVSGdxflPDb8_SLEU0xU8bu10BlCGfOLyk4nPpQVhVuQbFWN97msbsgdmzM-cYvbABm3LWm-va2PqaSGgHB2e4GVs-cZ3mD88kBni-JC4SXlLm45pj91G4fszPfRinc5f2o9DYNq8NyOOw/s1763/Kate&#x27;s%20photo.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhVVEoi17MeQD4accwhvNhO2iMw0W3VxXAT0TsVuh1PkVSGdxflPDb8_SLEU0xU8bu10BlCGfOLyk4nPpQVhVuQbFWN97msbsgdmzM-cYvbABm3LWm-va2PqaSGgHB2e4GVs-cZ3mD88kBni-JC4SXlLm45pj91G4fszPfRinc5f2o9DYNq8NyOOw/w204-h400/Kate&#x27;s%20photo.jpg" width="204"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The picture of discontent<br></br></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Frankly for me the topic was much ado about nothing and I honestly think Kate's photo should not have been subjected to such ridiculous scrutiny. I wonder if you agree. </p><p>It was not "Mother's Day" in Spain last week which is in May. However, I did, however,  perform my role as mother when Oli and the children came for lunch. Because I still couldn't chew, I made something soft; what better than Shepherd's pie? Very British you probably think and you are right.

This week we have had representatives from India, Iraq, Spain and Mexico. Funnily enough they were all young and doing similar courses - a Master in Sport nutrition - and ended up making friends. Sarang came to live semi permanently on Tuesday and my other Indian guest, Niranjan, was delighted as the former made curry for everyone. Sarang is from Mumbai and Niranjan from Nasik. I can only imagine they were both happy  to be able to talk in Marathi together.  If my dear friend Sandra who was born in Bombay had been there, she would have been in her element. PS the only word I know in Hindi is "Namaste". Sandra tells me that in Marathi it is Namaskar. I must say that to them when we go home tomorrow. I love it when my guests make friends.  Mohammad posted a photo of him with Sarang, Rocío and Gabriela having dinner and entitled the picture "the nutrition squad". This is it. It tickled me pink.<br></br></p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiBuirBcoNdHx0gMniWo050-67Uaxz64-eCNk0Kq8IXWj3KHmYdRVTANlmlMAYku35V4vLYRcLq4DSTss9EfNOle7h98yfZP9rEyhF6CxvryrcdEFpGwL5Y39u5moCaAilcSMgIBDf7R1372VtUJhJQFNlIfHmvEQmncPTRdOzTyvANi3AD_EEW7g/s1176/nutrition%20squad.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiBuirBcoNdHx0gMniWo050-67Uaxz64-eCNk0Kq8IXWj3KHmYdRVTANlmlMAYku35V4vLYRcLq4DSTss9EfNOle7h98yfZP9rEyhF6CxvryrcdEFpGwL5Y39u5moCaAilcSMgIBDf7R1372VtUJhJQFNlIfHmvEQmncPTRdOzTyvANi3AD_EEW7g/w360-h400/nutrition%20squad.jpg" width="360"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My Airbnb sport nutrition guests making friends this week.

I was sorry that best foreign film didn't go to The Society of Snow. It went to The Zone of Interest which I have to see. It is about a German officer's family living next door to Auschwitz, so it will be just up my street. Oppenheimer too which is available on Prime Video for just 4.99. So why bother going to the cinema? We shall watch it soon, for sure. </p><p>Monday 11th March was the 20th anniversary of the Madrid train bombings at the hands of Al Qaeda - although at the beginning everyone was sure it was the work of the Basque terrorist group, ETA. 11M is our 11S also perpetrated by Al Qaeda three years before. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrbeHuhDUgiNkexdsXAzLq3RaN1OHxCkV8vbP4492Wq4HXv1PreMBzLYwJxMP4NRcPiQfOfhqYJk4WheV1752RDkv198aOlTlkknmuVX_6FsKDnO1JHlV0eSRkB6gpamLc-7oXuIhxEbx0oZhNQW7r_z7WWmQSRJowjmacBQ2MFIVKu88UrqmO9g/s1024/accident_102923.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="268" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrbeHuhDUgiNkexdsXAzLq3RaN1OHxCkV8vbP4492Wq4HXv1PreMBzLYwJxMP4NRcPiQfOfhqYJk4WheV1752RDkv198aOlTlkknmuVX_6FsKDnO1JHlV0eSRkB6gpamLc-7oXuIhxEbx0oZhNQW7r_z7WWmQSRJowjmacBQ2MFIVKu88UrqmO9g/w400-h268/accident_102923.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>One of the brutal images from the 11th March train bombings</i><br></br></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Anyone who was in Spain that day will remember what they were doing when they found out. I was in Segovia with my dear friend Anne. It was her leaving party as the Head of Marketing for Nokia Spain. The morning after, just as were going to have breakfast, oblivious to the bombing which took place around 7.15, her mother rang from Finland to find out if Anne was ok. That's how we found out. We rushed to a bar with a TV and saw events unfold. It is still the biggest terrorist attack on European soil. About 10 bombs exploded on 4 trains killing 191 people and injuring thousands more. It happened 3 or 4 days before the General Elections and most people think the attacks were politically inclined. The terrorists wanted the left wing opposition party to win rather than the right wing PP party in power. After all, in their mind the government deserved punishment for allying with the US, the UK and Portugal in their war against Iraq. Whatever their objectives, the left wing party, PSOE, did win the elections and most probably because of the train bombings. </p><p>That was the main news on Monday and most of the week. I remember returning from Segovia 20 years ago this week to Nokia House in Pozuelo but none of us could work. I just went home and sat glued to the TV shocked at what I saw. I even went to the mass demonstration in Madrid the next day, one of the very few I have ever been to. </p><p>For Sunni Muslims that day marked the beginning of Ramadan. Mohammad who is a Shia Muslim started his month of fasting on Tuesday. You see, politics also divide Muslims. Amazing. </p><p>I didn't fast on Monday but it has felt like it at times with all the dental treatment I have undergone. I can still only really eat soft food. Oh when will this be over or rather, when will my mouth feel normal? My gums were still sore from the bleaching which made things even worse. All these things were discussed during my weekly Skype call with my dear friend Amanda. Oh how lovely to have a close friend to get things off your chest. I do wish we lived nearer. I wish the same of my other best friends, Sandra, Adele and Kathy. </p><p><b>Tuesday</b> put me in a better mood as we got the good weather back. The sun shone and the weather is going to be great at least until Easter. That day I worked more on the contents of my book or rather travel diary of our road trip last year from Spain to Armenia. It's mostly a compilation of the 8 blog posts I wrote during the trip; one every Sunday; that, the maps and itineraries, accommodation and of course an introduction. My dear friend Sandra helped me with the front cover which is probably going to be this one or similar. No doubt, my editor will be Amanda, bless her, just as she was with my father's book. Adele, Sandra and I spent all week debating the title and subtitle and no doubt we could carry on for months but at some stage I have to make a decision. This is work in progress. Hope you like it.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjH13y0Xxfaq2k2RNrDHL00gtBuRv0xbhUBSvbr56wVJweBK2-SoPlJ72pf37ONLTD7hboyNT9jxsFeLcafjOA28TbW52P8-8JcY2TahjwEVUI50ZCYBmd4IK8BH6RkDQcxESS8eGFnr7tHJair32m7wI40GvI9yeTorMaiFVInp88gNTecl0kSsQ/s1409/front%20cover.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjH13y0Xxfaq2k2RNrDHL00gtBuRv0xbhUBSvbr56wVJweBK2-SoPlJ72pf37ONLTD7hboyNT9jxsFeLcafjOA28TbW52P8-8JcY2TahjwEVUI50ZCYBmd4IK8BH6RkDQcxESS8eGFnr7tHJair32m7wI40GvI9yeTorMaiFVInp88gNTecl0kSsQ/w296-h400/front%20cover.jpg" width="296"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Draft front cover of my book, the diary of our road trip to Armenia - 14 countries in 50 days, two oldies in a Mini. </i><br></br></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The book is just for us really but I shall have a shot at publishing it on Amazon Kindle.

That's our main topic of conversation at the moment. We shall not leave until May this time as we want to be with Suzy when she turns 40 on 28th April. Wow!<br></br><p>We were going to stay with her on <b>Thursday</b> when she sent a message to ask us to postpone our visit until next week. That put a spoke in our wheels but we soon decided we were going to travel anyway - I had done the packing -but to El Cuetu in Asturias instead. In any case we had to come here before Easter when our first guests of the year arrive. But before leaving I had my dental appointment to put in the 3 new bridges, the  final ones. We drove there with our luggage and food as well as Pippa and got to Majadahonda a least an hour too early. So what did we do? We went to have a coffee on the lovely pedestrian precinct Gran Via and we sat in the sun. Here is a photo to prove it. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLfZGaKY1Pi9PegUicKLhAXbylyB6I3Vm49fUNHLMBesphua7rnw7BqrBxwFVVte4rewyq_BMs0CTVKtCu3zzfdbvmh9-gyaBgzPjjQXD-k7W6DPH46B04p5myn5UJub5w0D6BcwytnL1kAIXv8rBcIAPjK9kv4v6LlHst6Ei2jFfBe_mdUOsF1Q/s4032/20240314_105140.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLfZGaKY1Pi9PegUicKLhAXbylyB6I3Vm49fUNHLMBesphua7rnw7BqrBxwFVVte4rewyq_BMs0CTVKtCu3zzfdbvmh9-gyaBgzPjjQXD-k7W6DPH46B04p5myn5UJub5w0D6BcwytnL1kAIXv8rBcIAPjK9kv4v6LlHst6Ei2jFfBe_mdUOsF1Q/w400-h180/20240314_105140.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Coffee in Majadahonda on Thursday <br></br></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>By the way, we were both wearing blue and white stripes that day -a coincidence. I was at the dentist by 11 for my 11.15 appointment. I honestly thought it would be one of the easiest sessions but it was pretty awful. I came out feeling like a zombie and couldn't even smile to show my teeth as my mouth was completely numb. I was not in the best of states for a 5 hour journey to El Cuetu. Thankfully Eladio drove. We stopped for lunch at a godforsaken place in Simancas near Valladolid. Of everything they had on the menu, I could only eat an omelet, the softest food available. It just served to fill my stomach. One of my teeth under the bottom bridge was throbbing and aching, something I had mentioned to my dentist. He told me it is common to feel sensitivity after putting in a new bridge due to some possible inflammation in the pulp of a tooth after such extensive treatment. As I write now it is feeling better and Dr. Google has informed me this side effect  normally disappears within 2 or 3 weeks.</p><p>We didn't get to El Cuetu until at least 5.30 or 6 and I felt tired. Apart from the teeth, I had been on my phone nearly the whole journey with Airbnb related work. I may be retired but I haven't stopped working .I can't believe just how popular our house outside Madrid is with guests. There hasn't been one night this year, so far without any.</p><p>So it was quite a relief to arrive to an empty house. But it was cold even though my neighbour, Loli, had put on the heating that morning. It's 100 years old and is not energy efficient. But it wasn't cold in bed and I had brought my dressing gown so I was fine. However, because of the pain in my tooth and the uncomfortable feeling of the new bridges in my mouth, I slept pretty badly.</p><p>I was up around 7.30 on <b>Friday</b> morning and soon greeted with sunshine. In Russia people started voting on Friday and I think the polls close today. They will mostly be voting for the maniac Putin -as there is no opposition, especially since he did away with Alexei Navalny. Damn the man who has been in power for more than 24 years and will probably die in power.</p><p>But we were't thinking about him when we drove to our nearest town, Posada de Llanes. Eladio took a photo of me as we left - for this blog of course. This is it. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQ4LWnZ0NluWRC9txsEFa3KzhN8JWsexHIC417MCIRZS3dGx4nVtvrxnUMT0FA4DaCpMbdYjumzY1PjBXfIBk2atujHFVckCAAjt2aik_mcL9hnnVgoYjXuyf51Dfj2stNjpEWGmF8w7DRKY_h1BCTKEjNj_6VbQefhgQd2HhHBRwmzzHPKGq8XA/s3465/20240315_104637.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQ4LWnZ0NluWRC9txsEFa3KzhN8JWsexHIC417MCIRZS3dGx4nVtvrxnUMT0FA4DaCpMbdYjumzY1PjBXfIBk2atujHFVckCAAjt2aik_mcL9hnnVgoYjXuyf51Dfj2stNjpEWGmF8w7DRKY_h1BCTKEjNj_6VbQefhgQd2HhHBRwmzzHPKGq8XA/w210-h400/20240315_104637.jpg" width="210"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Outside our village house in El Cuetu on Friday morning</i><br></br></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In Posada we needed things from the ironmonger. However, the market was open and I couldn't resist a visit. I bought a light blue and white summery jumper which I put on later as my other jumper was far too warm. I also got some pretty multi coloured sneakers from a great shoe shop called "Pisando Fuerte". That's where, Sandra, Adele and I had some bought shoes when we came here together in 2021. I later looked up the brand and it's Corina. I think they are wholesale shoemakers who supply to places like Pisando Fuerte. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEga2aIWjhUm78jNCcx3yi7fl1FIlBjMSdBq80AwbnqmwEzvyUuKz2ikNgf_CP1XJCcBhl5Zcl2Vnz2T5ozqTsEqSegFCxwmGIjIIkDcrYlshW8S4r4Q0vC88QMV6ROE_i1gVU5gjO2zyFIpTmcq0qA4RphnycaHOvTiiS0HpNbKHKofYJnlK5HO8Q/s4032/20240315_114828.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEga2aIWjhUm78jNCcx3yi7fl1FIlBjMSdBq80AwbnqmwEzvyUuKz2ikNgf_CP1XJCcBhl5Zcl2Vnz2T5ozqTsEqSegFCxwmGIjIIkDcrYlshW8S4r4Q0vC88QMV6ROE_i1gVU5gjO2zyFIpTmcq0qA4RphnycaHOvTiiS0HpNbKHKofYJnlK5HO8Q/w180-h400/20240315_114828.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Lovely new sneakers I bought on Friday in Posada.

Finally, I could enjoy our stay here.</p><p>We chilled out in the morning, sitting in the sun on our terrace which is looking a little forlorn as most of the flowers are dead or haven't come out yet.

Thank you darling.</p><p>We were soon off again, this time up the mountains - the Peaks of Europe  - where we had booked a table for lunch in the pretty village of Asiego (or Asiegu as it is referred to here). We had been to <a href="https://www.rutalquesuylasidra.com/sidreria-casa-niembro/">Casa Niembro </a>last September and were impressed with the place and the food. Asiego boasts the best views of the famous mountain, El Naranjo de Bulnes - more often called Pico Urriellu in Asturias. It is over 2500 m high and is not the highest in the Picos but the most famous probably because of its unusual shape.
