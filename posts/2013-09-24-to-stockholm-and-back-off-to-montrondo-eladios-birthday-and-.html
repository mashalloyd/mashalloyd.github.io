<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Hi everyone,</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I’m a bit late
with my blog post this week but if you read last week’s entry you will forgive
me because you will know I have been travelling yet again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Today is
Tuesday and finally I am at home and here to stay for a while.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So let me tell you about last week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I left off on Monday 16<sup>th</sup>
September when I wrote my blog on the plane on my way to Stockholm.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I arrived in
the early evening and went straight to my hotel, the <a href="http://www.hotelstureplan.se/">Stureplan</a>, right next door
to the company HQ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was disappointed
with my room as it had a tiny window in the roof which could not be
opened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I knew I couldn’t sleep there as
I would have felt totally claustrophobic, so after some haranguing with the
desk staff, I was finally given a junior suite, for a small extra charge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It turned out to be lovely with its own
balcony, the only negative point being that it was miles from the lift; but that’s
always my luck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was too late to go
out as it was already dark and uninviting because of the rain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I decided thus to publish my blog, order room
service and have an early night on quite a comfortable bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Unfortunately this time I hadn’t brought my
feather pillow which wouldn’t fit in my cabin luggage and I had relied on the
Swedish hotel having one which it didn’t. Thus I got three nights of fitful
sleep and came back with a sore neck. On the plus side, I ordered my favourite
Swedish food for dinner – an open prawn sandwich which is called “Räksmörgås”
as I learned from my Swedish friend Gunilla and Mexican but Swedish bred friend
Ilyana when I posted the picture below on Facebook.</span></div>

watched the end of Mr. Selfridge on my PC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I am now waiting anxiously for series 2 of the latter, series 4 of
Downton Abbey and series 2 of The Paradise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I have pre ordered the last two but I don’t think they will be available
until November or December. My next series will be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadchurch">Broadchurch</a> which was
recommended to me by Amanda and owing to my faulting memory I had forgotten I
had already bought it in a spate of Amazon purchases of British TV films and
series.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The day was
good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We had a day of training in “leadership
communication skills” imparted by a wonderful Brit called Dominic who turned
out to be from Bristol.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He was a
professional trainer who comes from the communications world but what I liked about
him most was his witty way of addressing us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I learned all sorts of new tricks and tools, one I particularly liked is
called “the elevator speech” – i.e. getting across your message in less than 45
seconds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The company he represents is <a href="http://www.synopsisonline.com/who-we-are/">Synopsis Communications Consulting</a>
and their mission is apparently to turn strategy into action; not a bad thing.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">In the evening
our team leader Anna, invited us all to dinner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>When I say all, I mean my colleagues from the communications team she
heads up and who are from the Nordic and Baltic countries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The meal was just up the road at a great
steak house called <a href="http://www.vassaeggen.com/index.php/en/">Vassa Eggen</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The food
was out of this world but I paid for it later as I tossed and turned all night
on a very full stomach.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Wednesday’s
meetings were more hands on and about topics we are all in the throes of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>As usual we had an early lunch and this time
we went offsite, but round the corner again and to the Scandic Anglais
restaurant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The meeting was over earlier
than planned and I realised afterwards that if I had known I would have caught
a flight home that afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So there I
was with time on my hands on Wednesday afternoon in Stockholm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>For once it wasn’t raining and the sun had
come out, although the temperature was only 14ºc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So guess what I did?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Yeah you guessed right, I went shopping and
had a whale of a time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I wanted to go to
Jackpot the Danish designer I liked but the boutique in Bibliotekasgatan had
closed down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>A Swedish colleague warned
me but said there was an outlet at Ahlens, a well known department store.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But first I thought I’d go to the Galerian
shopping centre nearby to visit Lindex, Kappahl and Vero Moda.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I never got to the latter two because I saw
and bought so many things at Lindex.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Lindex is a sort of Scandinavian Zara but as the pretty Hungarian
Italian Swedish born shop assistant who charged me for the clothes said, is not
as “snooty”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had never thought of Zara
as snooty but maybe some people do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
walked out of Lindex with a huge bag of emerald green jeans, various coloured
jumpers and cardigans and a white blouse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>The lovely shop assistant thanked me for adding colour to her day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I thought that was a nice compliment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I took a photo of my bag outside the shop and
immediately sent it to Olivia via whatsapp to tell her I had bought lovely
clothes for her and me as it was my intention to share the clothes with her.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Since I came
home I have found out that Lindex has an <a href="http://www.lindex.com/eu/">online store</a> and you can order clothes
from Spain and that the transport cost is just 7 euros.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That makes me happy as I love their clothes;
the Scandinavian style and up till now I could only shop there on my trips to
Sweden.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Conscious of
the small capacity of my suitcase and the difficulty of packing my new clothes
I skipped on Kappahl and Vero Moda and made my way to Ahlens to see what
Jackpot had to offer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Well they didn’t
have anything that appealed to me. But I did spy a nice boutique called In Wear
and here I invested in a fashionable bright red <a href="http://www.inwear.com/gb/item/fakahina-down-jacket-c50982001/">lightweight down jacket</a> which
everyone in Stockholm seemed to be wearing in different colours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Of course I won’t be wearing it for a while
as we are still experiencing summer weather here.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Ah I nearly
forgot to tell you that the whole purpose of my shopping expedition was to buy
a birthday present for Eladio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>And I
did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I bought him a yellow Gant shirt to
add to his collection of this lovely Swedish menswear.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">That evening I
had another early night in and watched the only film I had on my pc, The King’s
speech and which I adored in English as the first time round I saw it in
Spanish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Unsurprisingly I had the same
prawn sandwich for my dinner that night.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Thursday I
was going home and had no idea what an ordeal the journey back would be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>There were no direct flights that day so the
company had booked me a flight via London, arriving and leaving from Terminal
5.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I can tell you now that I will never
do that again as it is chaos at T5.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The
worst thing about returning via London is that you have to go through security
again – and the queues are endless, as well as passport control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thus I had no time whatsoever for shopping at
the airport, the only reason I agreed to travel back through London.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So there you have it, I left the hotel at
09.30 and didn’t get home till about 9 in the evening, 12 hours of travelling
for a 3.50h direct flight time.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It was good to
be home; but again it wasn’t for long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Yeah
we were going to hit the road again the next day, this time to Montrondo to
spend the weekend with Eladio’s 5 brothers and sisters and their wives/partners
and their Mother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Luckily I had the
morning to get organized and more importantly to go out and get cakes for
Eladio’s birthday to be celebrated in Montrondo and at home the following
Monday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I also had to buy a present from
my Father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had no idea what to get him
so decided on something safe; more Gant clothing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I got a lovely bottle green and white checked
shirt and bottle green cardigan to go with it.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We left after
lunch loaded down with food to share with the family; namely Fátima’s Moroccan
chicken tagine and her wonderful rice, as well as lots of other food for dinner
that night and our breakfasts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We got
there at around 19h and were greeted by the other first arrivals; José Antonio
and Dolores.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Dolores and I immediately
agreed on a brisk walk to Murias and back with Nuba their mongrel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We wanted to go the old way across the fields
and on the old path but hadn’t bargained for a group of horses or is it a herd?
That would have been fine if they hadn’t been so interested in us and started
trotting and then galloping towards us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>We weren’t sure whether it was threatening or not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I love horses but am wary of their size and
as I had no sugar or salt to offer them we opted for crossing the fence in the field

most of the family went off for a siesta.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>The men would need it to produce the energy necessary to stack literally
tons of logs from a field that belongs to them outside the village which would
be brought by a tractor in various journeys to the old house to again be

women looked on, enjoying the afternoon sunshine and also listening to the
radio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You are probably wondering why we
would be listening to the radio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Well it
was to follow a match: Pili and Andres’ son Mario’s was making his debut in the
León Handball first team playing in León on Saturday against the Huesca
team.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In the end they drew.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">One of the
main reasons for gathering together this weekend in Montrondo, apart from the business of transporting and stacking the wood logs for the winter,  was to make plans
to reform the old house which we have inherited. But before we reform ours,
Pili and Andrés will be rebuilding the old house next to it and which is now a
ruin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was where Eladio was born so
has a lot of sentimental value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>On Sunday
morning their builders came to look around and finalise the initial steps that
will be taken to start.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They had good
references from Eladio’s brother Alejandro, so he took them around the old
house we will be reforming too, to get a quote from them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Both young builders gave us the right “vibes”
and right now Eladio and I and, of course, Pili and Andrés are really excited
about our projects.</span></div>

Tuesday, the last day to be recorded in this week’s blogpost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Today I am fasting (yes I stick to the “fast
diet” but only when I am at home), but lots of things are cooking and happening
too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>To start with Oli is off to London
to see Suzy this Saturday (until next Wednesday) and amazingly she has managed
to get the BBC presenter she met in Galicia to show her round the BBC while she
is there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Also her day is now completely
topsy turvy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She went to work but rang
me shortly afterwards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She was coming
home as the editors of the programme are sending her to Galicia again
today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She will be covering the terrible
case of a 12 year old girl who is adopted and of Chinese origin and who was
found dead yesterday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The story is
national news. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I am happy for Olivia

investigative journalism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

thing that got “cooked” today, was another journey to London.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Whilst on our walk to Murias, Adela and I
agreed to go together with my other sisters-in-law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In the end the rest of them decided not to come
but Adela is keen to go and for various reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She has never flown before, nor visited
London but is very happy for me to be her guide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Of course I want to go with her too, but I
have a vested interest as it means visiting Suzy again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So I went and booked our flights for the
December bank holiday and we will fly out on Thursday 5<sup>th</sup> in the
evening and return on Sunday 8<sup>th</sup>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
