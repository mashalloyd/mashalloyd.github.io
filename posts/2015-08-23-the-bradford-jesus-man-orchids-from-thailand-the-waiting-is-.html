<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Hi everyone,</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Here I am
writing again from Montrondo.  It’s a
rainy Sunday and whilst everyone is having a siesta it’s the perfect time to
write my blog.  It has been a very up and
down week as you will find out if you continue reading.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Monday, my
fasting day, there was an item of news that caught my attention.  It was about a man from Bradford in Yorkshire
where I grew up called <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/thestoryofgeoffreybrindley/">Geoffrey Brindley</a> now aged 88.  He apparently had a stroke after a fall and
was in intensive care.  When I saw the
photos of him I recognized the man immediately. 
I always knew him as the “Bradford Jesus” man who used to walk the
streets dressed in a habit and sandals, come rain or shine and used to wave and
smile at all and sundry. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I used to
think he was a bit of a madman but this week I read that in the 60’s he got a
message from God.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">He went to live in a
cave and meditated for 12 days after which he began walking the streets and has
never stopped until he had the fall.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I
pray for his recovery.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">He was and is a

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Monday, a
beautiful plant arrived for Suzy.  They
were orchids from Thailand that dearest Jackie, John, Rafi and Tal had sent to
my oldest daughter the day before her operation.  Jackie knew Suzy had to give up her much
looked forward to trip to Thailand with her friends Rocío, Ana, Elena, Chati
and Ana because of the operation. So they sent her “something from Thailand” to
make up a bit for the lost trip.  What a
beautiful thought behind the present!<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">That very same
day, ironically, there were 2 bombs that exploded in the Thai capital, one of
them near a temple much visited by tourists in the centre.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It killed at least 20 people and was directed
at tourists.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It was easy to guess the
perpetrator. Isis of course.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It felt
funny that it had been Suzy’s destination and that now she wasn’t going.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Many people have cancelled their trips there
but not the “manada” who will be there by now.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I wish them a safe trip and a wonderful time, albeit without my darling
daughter.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Suzy arrived
late that night.  We didn’t get to bed
until past midnight and had to be up really early the next day to be at the
hospital by 7 a.m.  The waiting was
nearly over but not quite.  The worst was
to come, the last few hours before the operation was over.  I told you Suzy had been diagnosed with
endometriosis, a 4cm cyst in her left ovary and a smaller cyst in the
right.  What I didn’t tell you here in
this blog was that there was also a tumour on the left cyst and that the cancer
markers were very high.  So, yes, she and
all of us have been worried sick since we got the news at the end of July.  Originally the operation would have taken
place after her trip to Thailand but because of the tumour markers, it was put
forward to 18<sup>th</sup> August.  Those
3 weeks seemed eternal.  Suzy went back
to London to work to work and keep her mind occupied with other things.  We went to Montrondo and to Santa Pola but
there was always a cloud hanging over us as you can imagine.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We were in the
best of hands at the hospital.  Juan,
Rocio’s father, is the head anesthetist and he would be in the operation which
would be directed by the chief “Manolo”, the gynecologist,a doctor we trusted
from the very start because of his experience and bed side manner.  He was a darling.  Soon Suzy was taken away from us and we had
to endure nearly 3 hours of waiting without knowing the outcome; scared stiff
of course. The operation was to be a laparoscopy, it would last 2 hours and
Suzy would be given a general anesthetic which she would be having for the
first time. I spent the time on my phone exchanging whatsapp messages with my
friends and family and praying.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">When the operation
was over, both doctors came out to tell us the outcome and it was good and I
nearly cried with joy.  In fact at that
moment I felt I was a believer and wanted to thank God and my darling Mother
(RIP) to whom I had prayed constantly. 
They told us the Pathologist had said the tumour did not look at all malignant
(we will have the full results in the middle of September). Thus, Suzy did not
have cancer, oh joy of joys.  They had
removed the whole of the left ovary as it was completely invaded by the cyst as
well as the left fallopian tube.  The
right ovary was in perfect shape, not so the right fallopian tube which was
damaged.  The damage did not come from
endometriosis as the gynochologist had feared but from some past and unknown inflammation
and also from adhesions which had stuck her ovaries to her intestines.  The doctor also removed them during the
operation. This means that Suzy will be able to be a Mother although she will
need help when the time comes.  Thanks to
Juan we were able to see her straight after we got the news.  She was very groggy but awake and able to
understand when I told her she didn’t have cancer.  She cried and I did too, but they were tears
of joy.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We spent the
rest of the day by her bedside where we joined by Olivia and Miguel.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Later some of some of her friends came and we
made quite a noise.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Suzy was chirpy and
felt no pain as she was being fed pain killers.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The photo illustrating this week’s post is of Suzy in hospital
surrounded by her friends. We spent the rest of the day with her until we were
literally asked to leave. Suzy was not in pain and we gave her dinner before
leaving the hospital.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I must admit I was
exhausted and so was Eladio.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">There was
not much to eat at home as I hadn’t done the food shopping for some time (my
mind was on Suzy and not on domestic tasks) so we decided to join Oli and
Miguel at a lovely place in Majadahonda called El Retoque, a place I highly
recommend.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The pain only
came the next day and most of it was from wind in her upper body because of the
gas injected during the laparoscopy.  As
soon as we had finished breakfast on Wednesday morning, Eladio and I headed for
the hospital keen to see Suzy and Manuel who would be giving us instructions
about her recovery. She took her first steps at midday after which she was
discharged and we took her home.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Suzy came home
in much pain. She found it difficult to walk and could not bend down.  We put her straight to bed.  Thankfully by lunchtime she was able to make
it downstairs and we had a family meal. 
My Father was delighted to see her again and to get the good news.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">That afternoon
I did the food shopping helped by Miguel and Olivia.  Meanwhile the fruit and flower basket I had
ordered for Suzy as a get well present from the family came.  I had ordered it from “Las Naranjas de la
China” and this is what it looked like.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

faster), I prepared a lovely Swedish dinner; a platter of salmon and prawns on

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I skipped work
that day to spend all the time I could with Suzy.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Some of her friends from “la manada” came to
see her including Rocío, Elena, Teresa and the latter’s boyfriend whose name I
cannot remember.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I have to say we had a

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Friday 21<sup>st</sup>
was our 32<sup>nd</sup> wedding anniversary. Fancy being happily married for so
many years? Well, that is our case. Although I was completely in love the day
we married I could not have known then what a happy marriage we would have.  As I said on facebook that morning, Eladio is
my friend, my lover, my companion, my doctor, my teacher, my plumber, my
gardener, my electrician and the best husband and father in the world.  I got many remarks to the comment; the best
one coming from Vicente who said “the plumber thing is very important” hahaha.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We left at
about 11.30 with little Pippa and a very full car.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Apart from our luggage and food we were
taking all sorts of things for the new house.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The purpose of the trip for Eladio and I was not actually a normal long weekend
there. We were going because on Saturday morning the lorries with all the
furniture we had ordered from Ikea were coming from Madrid.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It was rather annoying that the furniture was
to be installed inside an unfinished house. The builders have had lots of problems
with the carpenters and other suppliers probably because it is August, the
holiday month in Spain. The truth is there has been literally no progress on
the house since we last came which is infuriating.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></div>

set off in a very good mood and the three of us looked forward to lunch at the
Parador in Benavente.  As usual, both
Eladio and I enjoyed the dish of chickpeas we always order there and which are
from a village called Fuentesauco, famous for these pulses.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

afterwards the carpenters arrived.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We
could hardly believe they were there after having laid half the floor 3 weeks
or so ago and not coming back since.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">

next Tuesday.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">As soon as they arrived,
lo and behold, the 2 Ikea lorries from Madrid arrived followed by our builders.
I have never seen so much activity at the house and Eladio was as busy as a bee
and happy as little boy with new shoes the whole day.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I was happy of course, but didn’t like seeing
the furniture being installed in an unfinished house.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I will love it when it is all finished but do
not get much joy from the process, particularly as it has taken so long (nearly

great success.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Manolita was a star and
is a super actress. As I was leaving I was approached by a polite middle aged
man called Leopoldo who told me he read my blog.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">He wanted me to write more about Murias de
Paredes and not so much about Montrondo.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I was very flattered he read my blog but I don’t know much about Murias
although I walk there every day.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In the
past though I do know that for Eladio’s family going to Murias was like going
to the big town and they would get dressed up to go.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Today there are probably no more than 40
people living in Murias. There are about 15 in Montrondo.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Thanks Leopoldo for approaching me and thanks
for reading my blog.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I made fabada
(bean stew) for lunch and whilst it was bubbling on Dolores’ hob, Suzy and I
went again to Adela’s house for a cup of coffee.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We also went to say goodbye to Marta who was
leaving for Ponferrada where she lives.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We
could have gone to mass today like the rest of the village but preferred to go
to Senra, the next village after Murias, to buy bread.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It’s quite an
experience buying bread in Senra where the bakery seems to have existed for
more than a century.  This was where
Eladio and José Antonio had to walk to buy bread for all the family to last a
few days.  Their load was very heavy and
Eladio, being the oldest and the strongest always carried a heavier load than
José Antonio who was younger and not a good eater.  So every time I go to buy bread at Senra,
apart from enjoying the romance of an old fashioned bakery, the image of the
two young brothers comes to mind.  On the
spur of the moment I asked Dolores to take a photo of me outside the bakery
with the 2 loaves of bread and here I am. 
It’s a great picture. Thanks Dolores. I should add too that the bread
from Senra is the best in the area.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

Sunday or maybe Monday as on Sunday week Suzy will be returning to London and I
want to spend as much remaining time as I can with her and with Oli of
