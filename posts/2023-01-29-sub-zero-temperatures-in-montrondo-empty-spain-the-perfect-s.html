How are you doing?<p>Today is our last day in Montrondo. It's time to go home and as my father used to say "<i>all good things come to an end</i>", They do. After more than 10 days, I am actually looking forward to going home even though we have had a great time. It was the snow that had attracted us and we got plenty of it.  I hadn't seen real snow since the Filomena storm in Madrid two years ago and I got my fill. I also got my fill of cold weather and a wonderful rest in our cosy house. If anything can be described as "slow living" it was our time in Montrondo these last 10 days. </p><p>Last <b>Sunday</b> morning we woke up to -9ºc which is even quite cold for Montrondo. Tucked into a small valley at over 1000 metres high and surrounded by mountains, it often snows here, although, as elsewhere, not as much as when my husband was a child. Even so, it was quite a record for me. Here is a screenshot from my phone to record the sub zero temperatures this week. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIJOpgcw7ByA9QR61YvvDN4OZYmSm3ENX9NN7fwm53iXe-IMbsMofewIVKigpIcDu98DMv4sLtkdVKIrQw9jD0q76gCjMMfyJWK_YXHkHRAru2QfLOcePx0uwWkqkHN55O8gNJuZT36O_GRwQT--bPD4lS8JDRhsnMXJPyFOTyU7uAjCydxOI/s1819/WhatsApp%20Image%202023-01-22%20at%2008.49.59.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiIJOpgcw7ByA9QR61YvvDN4OZYmSm3ENX9NN7fwm53iXe-IMbsMofewIVKigpIcDu98DMv4sLtkdVKIrQw9jD0q76gCjMMfyJWK_YXHkHRAru2QfLOcePx0uwWkqkHN55O8gNJuZT36O_GRwQT--bPD4lS8JDRhsnMXJPyFOTyU7uAjCydxOI/w199-h400/WhatsApp%20Image%202023-01-22%20at%2008.49.59.jpg" width="199"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Sub zero temperatures in Montrondo this week</i></td></tr></tbody></table>I sent it to the family whatsapp group and Suzy, my elder daughter, asked for a photo to prove it and this is what I sent, the view from behind the house.

Before leaving I had to have a photo of the house surrounded by snow. Our house - the stone one with brown windows - can only be seen from one place in the village. Otherwise, it is completely hidden. It is sandwiched in between houses belonging to my husband's siblings. <br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjzVzDN9xNHAROdQ_uLNaZiHuagFX1GJ8f-OnvKds6ZQVQklNAYitFYLUMRMHgebNChKLLdNlArlxzavPNwnjvJYbG4G8gdVa_1tGrM0VhMxy4SuHYUy0GHaF8azsWxPQne5QOqz4cTbfahNsSEDHPrxrZkyZIUgy9npQ2fZawDYK2O-99bXBs/s2014/20230122_125432.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="348" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjzVzDN9xNHAROdQ_uLNaZiHuagFX1GJ8f-OnvKds6ZQVQklNAYitFYLUMRMHgebNChKLLdNlArlxzavPNwnjvJYbG4G8gdVa_1tGrM0VhMxy4SuHYUy0GHaF8azsWxPQne5QOqz4cTbfahNsSEDHPrxrZkyZIUgy9npQ2fZawDYK2O-99bXBs/w400-h348/20230122_125432.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our house surrounded by snow - it's the stone one with brown windows and doors</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We took the only walk we could, the road to Murias de Paredes, as it was impossible to go up the snow covered mountain path where I once broke my leg on ice. On our way out of the village we always pass one of the fields that belongs to Eladio. He likes to know he has it although we won't ever do anything with it, I suppose.Here he is pointing it out, wearing his fetching red winter coat. <br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgNHvCKSiyduJiLOdtCe3nGt8I8-bVMG0DiOJMqYAlWf7Top4AX7lJxK7Tq2t1FtjCb_ZW-eUUhGiyoCEmJFj8R4FAiBebbnAbOmON61dVhtWouXBxlk04qvfvTSf983bzOIPp_ZEakS4HqDA4Ug_3HrQqH2SIhuDbKUyDJZhZx5rpPdp6JvSA/s762/20230122_130553.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgNHvCKSiyduJiLOdtCe3nGt8I8-bVMG0DiOJMqYAlWf7Top4AX7lJxK7Tq2t1FtjCb_ZW-eUUhGiyoCEmJFj8R4FAiBebbnAbOmON61dVhtWouXBxlk04qvfvTSf983bzOIPp_ZEakS4HqDA4Ug_3HrQqH2SIhuDbKUyDJZhZx5rpPdp6JvSA/w400-h180/20230122_130553.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio on our walk last Sunday, pointing out a field he owns - well, I suppose, we own. </i></td></tr></tbody></table>Wherever we went, Pippa went with us but she didn't like the snow.

She had brought us some walnuts and home made sponge cake, bless her. It was good to talk to someone different from my husband for a change, hahahaha.<div><br></br></div><div>Not many people live in the village permanently. I tried to count and think it is just 10. Other people, like us with links to the village or a house here, often come at the weekend and in the holidays, so it isn't completely deserted. However, Montrondo, is definitely part of what they call  "empty Spain". Roughly 90% of the population  (about 42 million) live in towns and cities that occupy just 30% of the land while the remaining 10% occupy the remaining 70% and Spain is pretty big. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgkqUbhK_CXcb7aYyEsb2_01nlczo6SQNi9AEuBMuJzdMoIuiPq4xmgPqcl3jlkUOoTIQh0LUsZ6koBpPV84WIF-SlpiZyBwvOpF2W00aNLnNcFsLoZTg7w7_tWE6UacnBRlejMXKYpWJVFvB7-wlrhBNBnSsQ24P2uWg1H1jAFre4qryehN2s/s640/0exsochf7z781.webp" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="284" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgkqUbhK_CXcb7aYyEsb2_01nlczo6SQNi9AEuBMuJzdMoIuiPq4xmgPqcl3jlkUOoTIQh0LUsZ6koBpPV84WIF-SlpiZyBwvOpF2W00aNLnNcFsLoZTg7w7_tWE6UacnBRlejMXKYpWJVFvB7-wlrhBNBnSsQ24P2uWg1H1jAFre4qryehN2s/w400-h284/0exsochf7z781.webp" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Empty vs crowded Spain 90% live in just 30% of the land and 10% in the remaining 70%</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>There is a lot of talk but not much is being done about it. Empty Spain (la España vacía or España vaciada) lacks the most basic of services; health, education, internet and even though housing is very cheap, rural Spain is not an option for many people from the city precisely because of the lack of services, not to mention the job market. I wonder how many people lived in Montrondo when Eladio was a child, probably a couple of hundred or more. Oh how that figure has dwindled. In the 60's he  persuaded his parents to leave the hard life of farming cows to move to the nearest city- León -  and they did , as many others before and after them; the original cause of "empty Spain" But their roots here have never been forgotten. Our girls now nearing 40, love the village and little Elliot does too. So when we built the house 8 years ago we did it not only for us but for our daughters and future generations. That's why I love seeing Elliot and Juliet enjoying their time here like their mother Oli when she was a child.  It  was more a sentimental investment than anything else. It's also an incredibly safe place to bring children, especially in the summer, when it is anything but empty.</div><div><br></br></div><div>There is not much entertainment around here so you have to bring your own and we came armed with our PCs, my iPad, our mobiles, kindles, DVD player,  smart watches and blue tooth headphones. That means we need more and more plugs so recently I invested in a sort of control tower which is what we call it and it goes with us everywhere.  This is what half the kitchen table looked like in Montrondo this week when we were connected. Quite a sight  I thought I ought to show you. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh83aybEz2shxRkCZeqBMlHmZJ5xaXpEdje3th7Yx4nY9JwVkFkL9x5W4nyu9iDLToKLJXo0kzEAsKpqOUNjqrDHZ8GFre-p6m6jnTmGNSS8InK3wsOs71hlBJxtmlaH4oveVTkTt-mD9YfNl0O1YMeqGdzSDOiiIYkyqD7jCmtRDeg4oJoVQ0/s2016/WhatsApp%20Image%202023-01-24%20at%2010.47.21.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh83aybEz2shxRkCZeqBMlHmZJ5xaXpEdje3th7Yx4nY9JwVkFkL9x5W4nyu9iDLToKLJXo0kzEAsKpqOUNjqrDHZ8GFre-p6m6jnTmGNSS8InK3wsOs71hlBJxtmlaH4oveVTkTt-mD9YfNl0O1YMeqGdzSDOiiIYkyqD7jCmtRDeg4oJoVQ0/w400-h180/WhatsApp%20Image%202023-01-24%20at%2010.47.21.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our control tower in Montrondo</i></td></tr></tbody></table>You might notice there is also a note pad for hand written notes. Well, we all still write by hand occasionally don't we? Funnily enough this last Monday was the International Day of handwriting - there seems to be an international day for everything these days. It caught my attention and brought back memories of lessons in calligraphy at Rossfield, my posh primary school in Bradford. Our teacher, Miss Haze (or was it Miss Haize?), was very strict and thanks to her I had beautiful handwriting. However, it has suffered over the years and she would be appalled at how I write now, owing to the digital age I'm sure she would never understand. <br></br><div><br></br></div><div>There is a semi smart TV  in Montrondo but internet is the basic type (ADSL) which makes watching Netflix a slight challenge. We watched more of Fauda that night. It's very gripping. </div><div><br></br></div><div>I slept so well here, waking at around 8 am instead of 6 am and feel completely restored mentally and physically but I don't think I could live here for longer than a month. However, it's nice to come and go when we please or when we are free to come. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Again we woke up to sub zero temperatures on <b>Monday</b> this week. We had another quiet and repetitive day, not that I am complaining. Our time in the village was very restoring for the soul, the body and the mind. Again we wrapped up well for our walk that morning as you can see in the photo below.</div><div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjp_i4x_hceZhpozxp_s6Ys5pzPQet76IvbguAKTzc9TYO9bvtg9MB9KmS0A64NMVgIAlTOImEmd2O-6MMeD0Bnw8OnYKu16-bIJdCLdoFG1glzSOp8oKfxpaDVLrh2lQGm2XaDAnbd2aSHWuh1Xq5jD1bj3IRi02AivVpOKNLcgopuNNRvOi4/s734/IMG-20230123-WA0003.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="194" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjp_i4x_hceZhpozxp_s6Ys5pzPQet76IvbguAKTzc9TYO9bvtg9MB9KmS0A64NMVgIAlTOImEmd2O-6MMeD0Bnw8OnYKu16-bIJdCLdoFG1glzSOp8oKfxpaDVLrh2lQGm2XaDAnbd2aSHWuh1Xq5jD1bj3IRi02AivVpOKNLcgopuNNRvOi4/w400-h194/IMG-20230123-WA0003.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our walk on Tuesday morning</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></br></div>We met other walkers, not many and curiously a man who is not from the area but upped and left Alicante to live in Murias by himself and his dog.

This is it and I am not an expert at using it but it does make food taste better. It must be thanks to the oak wood Eladio uses to fire it up. When I posted a photo of it on Instagram people thought it was an antique cooking range.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This recipe will make two small to medium tortillas and is much easier
than making one large one.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 13.5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><b><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Ingredients:</span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> Olive oil, 3 to 4 medium sized potatoes, 1 large semi sweet onion,

although some prefer it without onion – not my case.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 13.5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

slightly brown. - use about the same amount of oil you would for making
chips. </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 13.5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

to the pan with the underdone part at the bottom. It must just hit the hot oil

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It’s <b>important </b>for the
egg part of the tortilla to be a bit underdone inside but brown on the outside.
Once out of the pan, it will continue to cook with the residual heat.  So,
if you like yours moist – which is how it tastes best – serve
immediately.  If it is not moist  inside, it can taste a bit
rubbery and dry, so getting the right consistency is key to the perfect
tortilla.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 13.5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; text-align: left;">Later we devoured three more episodes of Season 4 of Fauda and only had two left to watch but decided we would watch it from the beginning again to refresh our memories and keep us entertained.

It seems we had managed to get  a man to come on  Thursday either to repair the induction hub or replace it. We didn't want to  leave here until it was sorted. In the end he came on Friday. He took it away to be repaired and has promised to bring it this morning around midday. We cannot leave until he comes. </div><div><br></br></div><div>That morning I got my first pension pay of the year. The government had announced a rise of 8.5% for pensioners, supposedly in line with inflation and I was interested to know how much more I would be earning.  However, part of that would be offset by rising income tax - in my case by 3.5% which meant the net increase was only 5%.  For people who earn an average or low pension the increase is very little. I was interested to know how many pensioners there are in Spain and it is over 11 million. However, only 463,000 earn the maximum pension. Eladio and I are one of the lucky ones. In Spain too the retirement age is now 66 and will be soon 67. Anyway, enough of that, apart from to say that life as a retiree (hate the word pensioner) is great although I dread old age. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Before our morning walk and my long leisurely shower, I put a shoulder of lamb on in the oven with potatoes.

I couldn't believe I slept for nearly 2 hours!<br></br><p class="MsoNoSpacing">I could't believe I was hungry again either when it was dinner time but the mountain air and snow in Montrondo only increase my appetite. The news was good that day. The NATO allies agreed finally to send tanks to Ukraine. On the other hand, I think their hesistancy is how Russia will react. Well, it can't get much worse can it? Eladio thinks we are in the middle of World War 3. I hope not.</p><p class="MsoNoSpacing">I was cheered up by two more bookings I got that night. Roger, our Canadian guest who was born in Panama was returning that evening and today a professional padel player from Sweden is coming for 13 nights. We also had the Chinese family staying and this weekend a group of 8 students. So the house was chock a block. When we go home it will be less so. </p><p class="MsoNoSpacing">That night we devoured the last two episodes of Fauda's Season 4 and I hated the ending - no spoilers if you haven't reached the end. We both agree it is one of the best spy thriller series out there, as good or better than Homeland. And then we started watching it from the beginning again. My memory is so sketchy these days that there is no problem watching series more than once as I can hardly remember anything. The exceptions are my favourite films of all times: The Sound of Music, Dr. Zhivago, Gandhi, Gone with the Wind and The  Inn of Sixth Happiness. </p><p class="MsoNoSpacing"><b>Wednesday</b> came and again we woke up to -9ºc.

I think our supplies could have lasted longer but I, at least, needed a change in our routine. </p><p class="MsoNoSpacing">We didn't leave until I had had my leisurely shower. I love the slow living in Montrondo and the house we built to spec from the original family house. I especially love  our bedroom  which we designed ourselves - lots of black and white. I was a bit inspired by a hotel I love in Barcelona, the 1898 where all the rooms are decorated in  stripes. So I took some photos for you to see. </p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg-ygsvPtE1W-Lq4kudQaPveAWLP4sy9I3DaCtRt1-xY8BJK5uYM1ZPBOAglsSJNxSzXi_egJS3JLVqjsAoQJDMqzFKKgs5uzCxPI6KA7N9ycF7TttC5TruxQc61d4CVtn2QWeYOm6uhWFY3wAngAC7bWbzbLuRfWfv-281Fsc5TPPX_-DYEj0/s762/20230125_094330.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg-ygsvPtE1W-Lq4kudQaPveAWLP4sy9I3DaCtRt1-xY8BJK5uYM1ZPBOAglsSJNxSzXi_egJS3JLVqjsAoQJDMqzFKKgs5uzCxPI6KA7N9ycF7TttC5TruxQc61d4CVtn2QWeYOm6uhWFY3wAngAC7bWbzbLuRfWfv-281Fsc5TPPX_-DYEj0/w400-h180/20230125_094330.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuG8jI4yW_d7z05OmuJ8ox-XOi7ufQRKQS05L12EXcnGIc89zKFUyjBZgjm391hU_Xil8YfFSuZ9u5EYfEJ278h1GFS19OsFwdXcMDJBRhUNeV4_hof5TFv2ZTLI9__ktjIfpsC_etBQo4k3hI9rjuMGGfAIslFQkfJJi8MTTnnK1viXckACg/s4032/20230125_094422.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuG8jI4yW_d7z05OmuJ8ox-XOi7ufQRKQS05L12EXcnGIc89zKFUyjBZgjm391hU_Xil8YfFSuZ9u5EYfEJ278h1GFS19OsFwdXcMDJBRhUNeV4_hof5TFv2ZTLI9__ktjIfpsC_etBQo4k3hI9rjuMGGfAIslFQkfJJi8MTTnnK1viXckACg/w180-h400/20230125_094422.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></br></div>The huge modern shower is great but I particularly love our claw foot bath tub.

We stocked up for the remainder of our time in Montrondo and to take provisions home where I suspected the fridge would be rather bare.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Finally this week we got to have coffee out at "elevenses" (12 midday for us in Spain). That was quite a luxury. Our last stop was to buy delicious "cecina" (cured beef, similar to braseola) and some ibérico ham from a shop I discovered through my sister-in-law Dolores. Called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/elasdeljamon/">El As de Jamón</a>, it is run by a young South American woman, Patricia, and her husband and sells the best quality cecina I have ever bought, even better than at "Aramburu" in Asturias and far cheaper. I noticed they sell online so when I run out I might make an order from Madrid. </div><div><br></br></div><div>The drive home was just as beautiful and we were nearly alone on the road. What I appreciate most about this area - Omaña (a sub region of the province of León) is that it hasn't been discovered by tourists. That is its salient feature and may it remain tourist free for a long time. As we drove through Murias, I spotted a white horse in a snowy white field. It's not often that happens so I asked Eladio to stop the car so I could take a photo for you. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7pfNAc1OsJLxZ63juqbvAHerlweEbyxx7tVslbVF2ZTXbG-Fw5yfi6fqGBJyfEuSk6UkVsrJrk8VcWRDn6Edw4fcTLVW-gm94PdhjJyf-Dv16bAcjx0Gvi3YUqCpGDb-XJ4u9G-6spr7a_pV30tBs9FluuCk1NSpbgat4PMbYQouoYWIm2MY/s762/20230125_132602.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7pfNAc1OsJLxZ63juqbvAHerlweEbyxx7tVslbVF2ZTXbG-Fw5yfi6fqGBJyfEuSk6UkVsrJrk8VcWRDn6Edw4fcTLVW-gm94PdhjJyf-Dv16bAcjx0Gvi3YUqCpGDb-XJ4u9G-6spr7a_pV30tBs9FluuCk1NSpbgat4PMbYQouoYWIm2MY/w400-h180/20230125_132602.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A camouflaged white horse in a white field as seen in Murias on Wednesday morning</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br></br></div><div>It's beautiful isn't it?  Although I felt a little sorry for the horse which must feel very lonely. If it was mine it would have company and be covered in a blanket which I have seen in fields in Sweden and in the UK.<br></br><p class="MsoNoSpacing">We were home just before 2 pm, unloaded the shopping and Eladio lit the cooking range as I needed it to make our lunch. Lunch was soup, fried fish and salad followed by delicious fruit. That's something we eat a lot of and I always have a huge variety that must include mangoes, pineapple, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries. We are fruit and veg freaks but I'm afraid we are old fashioned and still enjoy meat. No way will I ever become a vegetarian. </p><p class="MsoNoSpacing">The news was all about tanks for Ukraine which Russia said they will destroy. It was also about the Brazilian ex Barça football player, Dani Alves, who allegedly raped a girl at a discotheque in Barcelona in December - shame on him. There seem to be so many stories of sexual assault  these days it makes me sick. I wonder if it is happening more now than in the past or is just that more stories are being reported on? I guess the answer is the latter. There was also a horrible story which could have come straight from Fauda. A lone Moroccan man wielding a machete went on the rampage, going into 2 churches in Algeciras in Southern Spain. He killed a verger and tried to kill a clergyman and all this while a service was going on. Is he a terrorist or just a madman? Killing in the name of religion is loathsome but has happened throughout the centuries. Empty Spain might be empty but it is far safer than the cities in these mad times. We always say that if war comes we are moving here. </p><p class="MsoNoSpacing">On <b>Thursday</b> morning we woke up to new snow. It snowed most of the morning, new snow on top of old snow and soon most surfaces were covered in the white stuff. Here is a photo of the back garden while it was snowing.

I was dressed in my skiing trousers, thick boots, thick knitted socks (yours Anne from Finland) and my winter skiing coat. I felt and moved like an astronaut. I love the snow but skiing was never for me although I did try twice in my life. My husband, in contrast, is a natural. When he was a child, he wore home made wooden skis to ski to school with in the winter.  It was common in Montrondo. What weren't common in the "old days" in Montrondo were snow ploughs. Just as we opened the gates onto the road we were met by one and I had to have a photo.

The same horses we had seen the previous day were still in the same field and I hoped they had not spent the night there. I was worried they would be cold but even so enjoyed looking at them. I love horses and think the horse is one of the most beautiful animals in the world. When I was a child I wanted riding lessons but my parents thought that was for rich kids. My mother told me the nearest I would get to them was with my pony tail. I would have loved to learn to ride. Eladio did as it was the natural thing when he was a child. They had a horse called "Moro" (the Moor) which they all rode. He remembers his father taking him on their horse after the Christmas holidays all the way to Murias to catch the coach that would take him all the way back to the Seminary in León. He doesn't like that memory. I can hardly imagine a scene like that today. Life was hard in the village but people have fond memories.

We weren't leaving until the induction hob technician came so I hoped by then the snow plough would have made an appearance. I was wrong. Even so I badgered my reluctant husband to remove the snow from the car and drive to Villablino. I knew it was a challenge and he wasn't happy about it. He went along with me to keep the peace I suppose but you know what?

So off we went to Sosas de Laciana to El Campillo. We have been quite a few times and it never disappoints. They offer a menu of the day for just 15 euros. It includes wine, bread, dessert and coffee and has at least 8 choices for both the first and second courses. If our house was nearer we would go more often. Being January it was very quiet and we were the only diners. We were ushered to a corner table which we loved. The waiter took our orders and then I went to spend a penny and when I came back this was the sight that greeted me - a table full of wonderful food and drink and my husband with a big smile on his face.

She was ecstatic to see us, as usual. But I didn't feel bad about leaving her alone in our warm and cosy house. Friday was the only day we skipped our siesta. Instead we watched a bit more of Fauda and then Eladio went on a cleaning spree of the bathrooms, bless him. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Meanwhile, in Auckland, New Zealand, where my cousin Katty and family live,  the city was experiencing the worst floods ever recorded. People died, the airport closed and my Kiwi family battled with draining the water that had flooded their whole first floor. They also tried to battle with the insurance company. I was flabbergasted and felt for them. Freak weather is becoming more and more frequent. Another cousin, Andrei, in Canada, reported "<i>it snowed enough here yesterday that we beat the 100 year record for accumulation for the 25th January</i>! Our adventure in the snow here is nothing compared to what he faces so often in the winter and where they use snow ploughs even to clear the "sidewalks". We only met once and it was in 1977 - when I was just 20. I traveled with my mother who was to meet her brother, Andrei's father, Sasha, for the first time since WW2. What a meeting. I shall never forget the snow in Montreal - snow here is kid's play compared - and how we actually managed to fly out of the city in the biggest snow storm I have ever witnessed. </div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Saturday</b> dawned and it had snowed again. I love the snow but don't like walking on the slippery road to Murias as I dread a fall  - I have a tendency to fall as you probably know. Yesterday though it was quite covered with snow and not slippery at all. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We woke up to a quiet house unlike our house in Madrid where, unbelievably, 13 people had slept - the group of 8, the Chinese family of 3 as well as Suzy and Lucy. Our Chinese family have finally found a flat and may be gone by the time we are home.  I am going to stay in touch with the mother, Amanda - a teacher of English  - as we really hit it off. The big group will have left this morning and in their place, Roger - the Canadian from Panama - and a Swedish padel player will be coming. <br></br><p class="MsoNoSpacing">Yesterday Eladio went into cleaning mode again and hoovered the whole house. I did a few shelves (I hate cleaning) and surfaces but mostly concentrated on making soup for lunch on the cooking range. It was snowing again and we were determined to get in another walk, our last here before going home. But first for my long and leisurely shower after my long and leisurely breakfast - I love slow mornings! While I was showering, Pippa was waiting for me right outside on the bathroom mat. She literally follows me everywhere and I had to have a photo to record that moment too. So many moments to record..... No worries, you can't see any of my ugly ageing body haha. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjn3jmntwDUZPfnwoiI12FSZ3nuHF-LRK2ZMLXjBVV58leWvsiD1mKUu_9k6HjO1NAUAuuGft-8GWVeEwIDYMFUjjL3m28OSvcQKAebNm6w3Vj3Sw8Fw5cJolYTHUwCv3a5dbRIz7jPJXCmt1UV95_MMJ8MHnNAq53j6dXl0Nhs1jwxi_b_9E0/s1655/Screenshot_20230128_121533_Instagram.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjn3jmntwDUZPfnwoiI12FSZ3nuHF-LRK2ZMLXjBVV58leWvsiD1mKUu_9k6HjO1NAUAuuGft-8GWVeEwIDYMFUjjL3m28OSvcQKAebNm6w3Vj3Sw8Fw5cJolYTHUwCv3a5dbRIz7jPJXCmt1UV95_MMJ8MHnNAq53j6dXl0Nhs1jwxi_b_9E0/w254-h400/Screenshot_20230128_121533_Instagram.jpg" width="254"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Me in the shower and Pippa on the mat waiting for me!

Just as we were leaving some of Eladio's siblings and their families were arriving from León - they are about 1h away from here - we would see them later.</div><div><br></br></div><div>And off we went into our private winter wonderland once again. I had had my fill of snow but it still awed me. Eladio took a couple of photos of me ready to go and I quite like them so chose one for this week's feature photo. My friend Sandra commented "<i>you are such a fashion icon! Pink boots pink gloves, lovely blue coat</i>".  If only she knew none of it was worn consciously, it just worked out that way. The pink wellington boots are hand me downs from Oli, the fuchsia gloves came from Yoigo merchandising and as to the coat, it's a very old H&M one I bought in Stockholm once. It's very warm but rather heavy. What Sandra couldn't see were that the trousers I'm wearing are Eladio's  old Adidas bottoms.  So no I'm not a fashion icon but I do like the result hahahha. </div><div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhP_nrNjG38bzK7synfizR5FY1tZgLTEA-78Z9hr-Ex7QBt-kWs1reD8ZCDeqIF6WQZZ8IfCK4QMq4UKUkHJQ7mBQQ9y2H4cxAQKEQwcNNugK8i_yvkx1Z7egT6ZcGVoHSsy63xCAxkWvv4ARRTpjYFnRrBOMVvGAOhDlyPlsdXS0MWybtjcu4/s735/IMG-20230128-WA0004.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="194" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhP_nrNjG38bzK7synfizR5FY1tZgLTEA-78Z9hr-Ex7QBt-kWs1reD8ZCDeqIF6WQZZ8IfCK4QMq4UKUkHJQ7mBQQ9y2H4cxAQKEQwcNNugK8i_yvkx1Z7egT6ZcGVoHSsy63xCAxkWvv4ARRTpjYFnRrBOMVvGAOhDlyPlsdXS0MWybtjcu4/w400-h194/IMG-20230128-WA0004.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>In the snow yesterday - colour coordinated but not a fashion icon hahaha</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We came home to a ready made meal - my leftover bean stew (fabada) and then another siesta.
