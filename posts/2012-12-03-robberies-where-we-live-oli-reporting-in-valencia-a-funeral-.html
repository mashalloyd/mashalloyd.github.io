<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"> </span></b><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Hi everyone,</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Well it’s been
two weeks since I last wrote.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Sorry if
you missed my post last Sunday but I was in Brussels and just didn’t have the
heart to spend any of my precious time there writing my blog.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So, here is a bumper edition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I shall start
this post then from Monday 19<sup>th</sup> November.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We woke up to news in the papers about
robberies in the area we live; multiple robberies carried out by Albanian
Kosovar immigrants who are known for their violence.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">You can read
the news in El País about the robberies <a href="http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2012/11/18/madrid/1353262202_335549.html">here</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>That very day Eladio decided to reinforce our alarm system and now we
have the most up to date alarm you can imagine with cameras in most of the
rooms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The great thing is that you can manage
it and switch it on and off from your mobile phone. So far, so good, just let’s
hope we are not a target.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Eladio is
delighted with what I call his new toy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Monday too,
Oufa, our new and delightful Moroccan living in home help, rang to say she
couldn’t come back from her day off as she had fallen ill and was at the
Emergency Ward at the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So she
sent her older sister Achouak to cover for her while she was ill.  Achouak is a
few years older and seemingly more religious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>She arrived with a veil and prayer mat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>What she didn’t tell us was that it was the first time she would be
separated from her 4 month old baby boy which would prove a problem as she is
still breastfeeding him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>When we found
out a couple of days later, we sent her home to take care of her baby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was interested to see that although Ramadan
is over, she was fasting now as during her pregnancy she couldn’t.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I already knew but witnessed firsthand that
she could only eat when the sun set and just before it rose; thus she would get
up at 5 in the morning to eat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>During
the day she could not eat or drink and mentioned that she got very
thirsty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She kept going off to pray so I
asked her to pray for us, I mean to make use of the time!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Luckily Oufa was better soon and came back
the following Monday and the house is well looked after, as is my Father.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Meanwhile
Olivia was in Valencia where she was to be all week and working again with her
boyfriend Miguel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Monday saw her in
Tarragona reporting on devastation there because of storms. She did not warn us
so we didn’t see it nor have any pictures to show.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I don’t think she knows quite how much, her
appearances on television brighten up our day and I wish she would be more
proactive in telling us.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Monday
night I had bad news.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>A former colleague
Carlos rang to tell me that his ex boss at Nokia, Juan Carlos, had lost his 19
year old son of the same name after he was run over in the street when crossing
the road near his home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was very fond
of Juan Carlos and was shocked and upset.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Being a Mother I can only imagine how terrible it must be to lose a
child.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I sent him a message to which he
replied and I was to see him the next day at the very sad funeral.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Tuesday was 20<sup>th</sup>
November and the anniversary of the death of Franco.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I can’t tell you how much Spain has changed
since his dictatorship and I know because I started coming to Spain with my
parents towards the end of his life. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Tuesday I
went into the office for the weekly management team meeting and there were
cakes on the table.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I commented that I
hoped they were not in honour of the Spanish dictator.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>While I was at the office I missed Oli on the
television reporting on a very sad case, the death of Vicente Guarner from the
small town of Benigámin, who was violently robbed in his jeweler shop a few
weeks ago. Olivia had reported on the robbery and met the whole family
including Vicente who she immediately liked, a jovial man in his early
60’s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So when she heard the news of his
death, probably caused by the vicious attack, she went to cover the story but
decided to talk about it outside the funeral parlour before going into to greet
the grieving family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She said if she had
done it the other way round she would probably have broken down and cried live
on the television.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You can see the clip <a href="http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/la-manana-de-la-1/manana-1-20-11-12/1584859/">here</a> if you fast forward to 13.49h.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Tuesday was a
sad day in many ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In the evening I
went to the funeral of Juan Carlos’ son. The church was absolutely packed with
friends and family and many of his colleagues including José Antonio M, Emilio
E, Carlos LA, Luis R, Oscar C, Barbara U and myself of course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>His loss is enormous, something he and his
family will never get over, just as my Father will never get over the loss of
his brother and sister.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I have my own
losses too, Mummy, George, Aunty Gloria and her family, Aunty Masha and then my
dear sister-in-law Sanya.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So I could
understand some of Juan Carlos’ pain.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">After the
funeral I went to a goodbye party for a well loved journalist Antonio Ruiz del
Arbol, one of the best in the telecoms sector.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>He has lost his job with the financial daily Cinco Días at the very
wrong age, his late 50’s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I felt for
him, just as all my other colleagues and journalist friends probably did and
who were with me at the party held at <a href="http://madridalacarta.com/guia-de-restaurantes-de-madrid/obsidian/neighbors/?r2wppg=404&amp;r2cat%5B%5D=restaurant-type.catering">Obsidian</a> in Madrid on Tuesday night.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Tuesday was
not a good day for the Church of England either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The Synod in the UK <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20421576">voted against women clergy becoming bishops</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Funnily enough
the votes against this came not from the clergy but from the House of
Laity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I mean if more than 30% of the
clergy in the UK are women, why is there discrimination in them moving up the
echelons?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I for one was not happy with
the outcome of the vote.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Wednesday
there was again bad news from the church, this time from the Vatican.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Pope Benedictus XVI revealed to the world
that the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/the-pope/9691295/Nativity-donkeys-and-cattle-are-a-myth-says-Pope.html">Nativity cattle and donkeys were a myth</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thankfully he added that that shouldn’t stop
people putting them in crèches at Christmas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I think this news from His Holiness was quite uncalled for and we didn’t
need to know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In fact I consider him a
bit of a Christmas wet blanket.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Wednesday
Olivia was on the television live again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Her report was about a group of Mothers, sort of Valencian Calendar
girls, who were trying to raise money for the school bus by making an erotic
calendar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Their problem is that the
route to the children’s school is just over 3km, the minimum the local council
will consider to provide a free bus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>And
they have to pay 90 euros per child per month for the school bus which is a lot
in these times of crisis, especially for families with more than one
child.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You can <a href="http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/la-manana-de-la-1/manana-1-21-11-12/1586043/">see the clip here</a> if you
fast forward to 11.30h.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Achouak, Oufa’s
religious sister watched the report with us and I think was very disappointed with
the subject of the report as she walked out of the room before it finished! </span></div>

favourite report of the week from his granddaughter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This time the story was about the oldest
couple to run the Valencian marathon the weekend before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was a great piece of innocent news which

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Thursday I
was tickled pink to receive some photos from a photo shoot some weeks before
which I had completely forgotten about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I have always been known as the “woman with the phone” as I work in the
mobile phone sector, so the photo illustrating this week’s blog, completely
sums that up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>At first I wasn’t
particularly pleased with it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>There was
no photo shop and if you enlarge it you can see so many wrinkles around my eyes
that I was a bit shocked at how old I look.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>However I have very generous friends who posted some great
compliments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Now I like it a lot and I
hope you do too.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Friday, the
day Oli and I were going to Brussels, I was up early to get a hairdo. I was
there by 8.30 and was the first customer, so was home just on time to see
Olivia reporting again at 10.22.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This
time the story was about a small town in Valencia, twinned with another small
town in Germany and the agreement to offer jobs to unemployed Spaniards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This, of course, is news in Spain as jobs are
now so scarce.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You can see the story on
<a href="http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/la-manana-de-la-1/manana-1-23-11-12/1588762/">this link </a>if you go to 10.22h.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">She was on
again later, this time reporting on a super Christmas hamper worth 100.000
euros, which would be raffled to coincide with the the 6<sup>th</sup> January seasonal
lottery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Some local people from Ibi in
Alicante, a town well known for producing toys and now struggling to compete
with Chinese produce, came up with this great idea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They bought all the goods, including a car, a
motor bike, trips worth thousands of euros, a salary of 15.000 euros and even
gold bars, not to mention cured Spanish hams and many other enticing goods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The idea is to sell some 250.000 lottery tickets
at 10 euros each which if they do so, will result in huge profit for the people
behind the idea of the “<a href="http://www.lasupercesta.com/">super cesta</a>”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Olivia and Miguel bought tickets and told us that in fact there were
very few left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However, can still buy a
ticket on their website. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>As I wrote that
I decided to try myself and I have just bought 5.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Hope I’m lucky.  <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">By the way you can see the clip <a href="http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/la-manana-de-la-1/manana-1-23-11-12/1588762/">here</a> if you fast forward to 13.48h.</span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">After the
report from Ibi, Oli had to rush back to Valencia to catch the high speed train
to Madrid and we were to meet at the airport in time to catch the 19.50 flight
to Brussels. You are probably wondering why we were going to Belgium.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Well Olivia was to be the MC for the <a href="http://u4energy.eu/web/guest;jsessionid=9D7C38DA43D257373DFE489DE832F8EB">U4Energy school competition </a>organized by the Commission for Energy to be held on Monday
night at the Belgian Comic Strip Museum and I was going along for the
ride.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We decided to go out on Friday and
make a long weekend of it and stay with my great friend from University Sandra
who I have mentioned many times before in this blog.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We go way back and are kindred souls in many
ways.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Sandie was born in India to a
Catholic Italian Father and Jewish Hungarian Mother, Magda (my friend on
Facebook) now aged 84 and who is a survivor of the Holocaust. Sandra was
educated in England and now lives in Belgium.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I don’t think you can get more multicultural than that. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We arrived at
her lovely flat in Fort Jaco on Waterloo way, at around 11 and after settling
in we probably chatted until way past 1.30h. We slept in separate bedrooms,
partly because Olivia says I snore but for my part it was because I didn’t want
the mess Olivia carries around with her to invade my privacy hahaha.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Saturday was
ours for taking and we enjoyed it immensely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>We were up at a decent time and enjoyed some pastries and croissants
Sandie had bought for our breakfast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Our
idea was to go out shopping to Brussels and shop was what did until we
dropped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>First we attacked a little
boutique in her high street called Blue Wood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Here I bought a practical warm and pretty little red jumper dress which
I adore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Olivia invested in two
colourful jumpers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Then we caught the
tram into Brussels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But that alone is a
story to tell as Sandie got talking to some of our fellow passengers; a gay
couple, a man from England who works at the EU Foreign Affairs office and his
Lebanese Syrian Jewish partner from Jerusalem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>They had a delightful little boy and Sandra being Sandra interrogated
them for all the bus to here as to whether the boy was theirs biologically or
not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She added that they were the first
gay couple she had met with a child.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
had thought that but didn’t dare say it to them like she did. By the time our
journey ended we had become firm friends.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Our first
destination in town was the Apple Reseller store.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Olivia had wanted to buy an iPad for a while
and Sandra finally persuaded her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We
came out with a lovely iPad 2 for which Sandie had bought Oli a beautiful pink
case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">From the shop
we walked towards <a href="http://www.sablon-bruxelles.com/">Le Sablon</a>, one of Brussels’ most beautiful squares and here
we stopped at the <a href="http://www.gien.com/cms/Ress_56/Europe/France/Les-points-de-vente/Les-boutiques-Gien/La-boutique-Gien-Bruxelles.html">Gien shop</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was on
my first trip to Brussels to see Sandie with Eladio that we had bought the
beautiful Indian motif plates here and I wanted to buy the matching tray and I
did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It is now in pride of place in the
dining room at home, far too good to use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Our next destination was lunch at the nearby <a href="http://www.lepainquotidien.com/">Le Pain Quotidien</a>, which
has become a tradition when in Brussels with Sandra.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Here we restored our energy with their
wonderful food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>After lunch we explored
the chocolate shops in Le Sablon and ended up buying low cost Belgian chocolate
at <a href="http://www.leonidas-chocolate.com/">Leonidas</a> which I thought was great. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We were
meaning to go home as it was getting late and we had a dinner date but Olivia
spotted a shop called CKS which had a huge closing down sale on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Here Sandie and Olivia bought armfuls of
jumpers, jumper dresses and trousers but I didn’t spot anything I particularly
liked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I kept wondering how on earth
Olivia and I were going to get all our purchases in our already quite full
suitcases.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The dinner
appointment was exciting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We were going
to have dinner at a former Motorola colleague’s house, Didier who had been head
of Motorola Belgium and then Denmark and France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He had invited another great colleague Harry
H who used to head up Motorola Holland and they were a very lively pair who would
make any meeting I used to be lots of fun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Didier and his lovely family live in a very up market street in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uccle">Uccle</a>
not so far from Sandra’s in a fabulous old house which we later saw was full of
paintings his wife Dolores does for a living.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We
were joined by their teenage children and another couple, a Belgian woman who
had worked at Motorola and her American husband who works for the EU.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Ah and I forgot to mention that Harry came
with his delightful wife Virginia, a South African teacher. So yes we were a
real mixture of nationalities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We had a
great evening and the food was fabulous, the only awkward moment being when I
dropped some lentils on their expensive looking carpet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We laughed about that afterwards of course.</span></div>

we visited the slightly disappointing Marche de Noel (Christmas market) where

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On our way
back we did a bit of food shopping for dinner that night at Jeffer’s (Sandra’s
partner) after which we drove Olivia to her long rehearsal at the <a href="http://www.comicscenter.net/en/home">Strip Comic Centre</a>, a beautiful art deco building near the Grand Plaçe and which is home to

then walked through the beautiful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galeries_Royales_Saint-Hubert">Galeries Royales </a>to the Grand Plaçe which was
preparing for Christmas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We wanted to
have a bite to eat and had decided upon a kebab or rather a doner kebab at a
great little Lebanese place called <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.in/Restaurant_Review-g188644-d810860-Reviews-L_Express-Brussels.html">L’Express</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It was time for coffee afterwards and we chose a cozy cafeteria called
<a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maison_de_la_Chaloupe_d%27Or">La Chaloupe D’Or </a>and were lucky enough to sit on a table next to an open
fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Our next stop was the biscuit shop
called <a href="http://www.biscuiteriedandoy.be/">Maison Dandoy </a>where I was eager to buy the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculoos">speculoos biscuits</a> we had

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I was rather
disappointed to learn later that they were replicas and actually the exhibition
was rather small, so we had soon seen everything and made our way again to the Strip
Comic Centre to pick up Olivia. I think we sort of barged into her meeting with
the organizers of the event, one of them being Carolina, a friend of Sandra’s,
and through whom Olivia got the job of MC last year and of course was repeating
the experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Olivia did look a little
embarrassed to see the two of us larger than life, very visible and rather
noisy (yes that is how we are), barge into the quiet of her rehearsal come
meeting. In any case it was time to go, so they called a stop and soon the
three of us were on our way to what turned out to be the highlight of the day;
dinner with Jeffer and his daughter Isaline, who I was to meet for the first
time, at their house outside Brussels.</span></div>

American communications professional, is a very creative cook and he had
rustled up a delicious carrot soup and quiche to which we added some of the
food, mostly of the finger type, we had bought earlier in the day. Isaline was

and it was Olivia’s big day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She was up
early to continue preparing and was off at midday by taxi for an all day
rehearsal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Olivia is used to doing live
TV and prefers last minute preparations to long winded organization of work, so
I think this event frustrated her a bit, or at least the way it was
managed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Sandie and I both worked
happily and peacefully from her flat and at midday she left me on my own when

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The prize
giving ceremony was to take place from 17.30 to 20h after which there was a
walk around dinner for which we were not going to stay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The plan was dinner at a Moroccan place called
<a href="http://www.lakasbahresto.com/">Kasbah</a> with Jeffer and Sandra.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Sandie
and I thought we had arrived late, as our tram had broken down but we were
lucky that the start was delayed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The
prizes were for national winners of the four categories of the <a href="http://u4energy.eu/web/guest;jsessionid=9D7C38DA43D257373DFE489DE832F8EB">U4Energy programme</a> and there were representatives from the best winners, the countries
being Croatia, Malta, Portugal, Spain, Frane, Italy, Austria, Romania, Sloveia
and Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In fact Spain was represented
by three schools, one from a small village in Zamora, another from Las Rozas in
Madrid and the last one from Alcalá de Henares near Madrid.</span></div>

be the MC of this high profile event and I spied her studying her notes in a
corner of the room full of 300 attendants, the teachers, their pupils, the
sponsors and the representatives from the EU Energy Commision. I was literally
dazzled by how she looked, so professional and oh so beautiful in the black and
blue sparkling dress by Zara which I lent to her for the occasion.</span></div>

English.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>And I was so proud of her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So many people congratulated her afterwards

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It was
extremely difficult to get away afterwards as everyone wanted Olivia’s
attention, plus she was interviewing the Spanish teams as she hoped to include
their stories on her programme on TVE back in Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But eventually we did and we made it to
Kasbah.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Here over the great pastela,
couscous and tajin, I made friends with a youngish Moroccan waiter. He asked me
if Olivia was my daughter and I replied, “yes, isn’t she beautiful” to which he
made me a wonderful compliment by replying: “her mother is the beauty, she
takes after her mother”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Wow I liked
that and will treasure that moment as I am now at the invisible age for women
in their 50’s who don’t often get noticed.</span></div>

with our hosts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They soon left, but
before so, Sandra helped me pack my case and I learned a great lesson from her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Instead of folding all your clothes in little
piles, as I have done all my life, if you put them in all flat you get much
more into your case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Later I tried this
out with Olivia, whose case was overflowing and amazingly we were able to get
everything in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I thought that was a bit
of a miracle. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Before leaving, as our
plane was not until 15.30, Olivia and I enjoyed a long walk in the forest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>On our way back we spied a great tree trunk
from where to take photos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The photo

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Believe it or
not, just before we went back to Sandie’s flat, once again we went into the
closing down shop called CKS where Olivia bought even more clothes, some for
Suzy of course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This time I found a
lovely indigo jumper dress, identical to one Oli had bought the day before and
now I am delighted I did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had some
trouble getting this last shopping spree into our cases but thanks to Sandie’s
technique I managed it.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">By 13.30 we
were in the taxi on our way to the airport where of course we did more
shopping: biscuits and chocolate mostly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>They would later contribute to the family dinner that evening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was so good to be home and to have dinner
with Eladio, Suzy, Olivia and her boyfriend Miguel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We had had a great time in Brussels, but
there is nothing like coming home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You
can see the rest of the photos of our great trip to the capital of Europe <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151360559706554.538713.612236553&amp;type=1&amp;l=554bbe32f4">here</a>.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Wenesday I
worked hard at home on preparations for the Yoigo press conference to be held
on Friday but stopped for lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had an
engagement with my great friends Julio and Fátima at La Txitxarrería in
Pozuelo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We talked about the ex Nokia
Christmas reunion dinner I was organizing the following week, but my dearest
Nokia friends will disappoint me by not attending.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Thursday I
was busy all day with frantic last minute preparations for the press
conference.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was to be my first
without my old boss Johan and I told him so in a message on Facebook.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He assured me everything would go well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>And it did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>We held the press conference which was to celebrate Yoigo being 6 years
old.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Fancy, already 6!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But the main reason was to present our
fabulous new tariffs which will come into force on 10<sup>th</sup> December for
our Christmas campaign.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was pleased to
see some 25 journalists and how we managed to create a party and friendly
atmosphere at a great little bar called <a href="http://whitby.es/">Whitby</a> (but nothing to do with the seaside town in England).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>For the record I wore my new Belgian red jumper dress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You can see more photos of the press
conference <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151366838816554.539490.612236553&amp;type=1#!/media/set/?set=a.10151366838816554.539490.612236553&amp;type=1">here</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Ah and I also want to
share with you, a <a href="http://www.eleconomista.es/videos/embed.php?idVideo=4438429">video</a> El Economista published of the event.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>If you watch it, even if it’s in Spanish, you
will get a feel of how the press conference went. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Friday was all
a big rush. I rushed home after the press conference to have lunch with the
family and again I rushed in the afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>This time the rush was with Suzy, for our annual MOT (gyno) and then
back for a late and rather dark walk with Eladio and the dogs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Later Eladio and I went out to dinner to
Ginos and it was a great way to celebrate the success of my press conference
and a great way too to wind up a very busy but great week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Plus of course I had some quality time with
my wonderful and patient husband.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Something
else happened on Friday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Just as we were
leaving for Ginos, the girls were preparing their dinner with Oufa and it was
then that Miguel, Oli’s boyfriend, handed us a pre seasonal Christmas present.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We were surprised and pleased to receive a
big Spanish ham which now has pride of place too in our kitchen. Thanks Miguel
and by the way I tried it last night for dinner and it tastes delicious.</span></div>

Saturday too was a bit of a rush.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was
1<sup>st</sup> December and I gave out the advent calendars I had bought for my
Father and the girls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>1<sup>st</sup>
December in many ways is the beginning of Christmas, a period we love in this
house.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It was another
rushed day actually. In the morning I did the weekly food shopping with Oufa
and Susana joined us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had to rush back
though as I had to be at the Phone House convention at nearby Kinépolis by
14.30 for the Yoigo part of the programme.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>And I only just managed it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was
home at 16h but on time to have lunch with the family who were finishing their
meal and had left some scraps for me hahaha.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Saturday was
another highlight of the week as I was going to the ex Motorola employee
Christmas bash at <a href="http://www.clerico.es/donde_estamos.html">Clericó</a> (an Argentinian joint) in Herón City.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Vicente H and Vicky S had organized the
dinner and my thanks go out to them as for me it turned out to be the most
enjoyable Motorola reunion dinner of all the ones I have attended.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Most of us who came, some 19, formed part of
what we always call the “analogical group”, the group of people who started
Motorola Spain in the early 90’s, 22 years ago. The photo below, where I am
wearing my red Brussels dress, is of the group but you can see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151369603241554.539959.612236553&amp;type=1">more photos of the dinner here</a>.</span></div>

friends I am nearly at the end of this bumper edition of my blog.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I started writing yesterday Sunday and today
is Monday morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Yesterday Olivia went
off to Valencia again with Miguel from where she will be working this week and
covering the news there for her programme.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Suzy didn’t come for lunch, it was Oufa’s day off so the house was very
quiet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We just did the usual things we
do on<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>a Sunday, write my blog, have a
quiet lunch, go for a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>walk with the dogs
and watch the Jorde Evole Salvados programme in the evening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span>It was good that I had a quiet day to relax
and unwind after such a busy period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
say it was quiet but we had a bit of a scare when my Father fell, trying to get
off the zimmer frame and into his chair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>He had a huge fright and was worried he might have dislocated his
replacement hip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But thankfully
everything seems alright. I gave him a shot of whisky to calm him down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He’s amazing at 93 to fall and not break
anything. However we shall have to keep a better eye on him from now on. </span></div>
