Good afternoon my friends this sunny Sunday afternoon in May. <br></br>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">I hope you’ve had a good week. Mine has been a bit like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curate&#x27;s_egg">curate’s egg</a>, only good in parts. How can an egg be good in parts you may ask? If an egg is not good, it’s bad I would have thought. That expression has been used often in my family and was first seen in a cartoon in the famous magazine Punch in 1895. A bishop and his curate were having breakfast and the bishop told the curate his egg looked bad. The curate, trying to be polite, answered it was “good in parts”. The exact conversation actually went like this: “Bishop: "I'm afraid you've got a bad egg, Mr Jones"; Curate: "Oh, no, my Lord, I assure you that parts of it are excellent!" My Father used it again this week to refer to the pineapple we had at lunch one day and when he explained the joke to Eladio we all had a good laugh.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">So yes, this week has been a bit like the “curate’s egg”, only good in parts. Bad news came for me last Monday when I heard that a colleague of mine, Fernando’s Mother had died. She was just 70 and had an attack in the car last weekend whilst they were driving with his small children to a first holy communion. She had thrombosis caused by defective arteries and died later in the hospital. A year and a half before Fernando had lost his Father too, so now he is an orphan. What a tragedy.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">There was news of another <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cycling/13333589.stm">tragedy</a> on Monday too when the 26 year old Belgian rider Wouter Weylandt met his death at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giro_d%27Italia">Giro</a>, the Tour of Italy. It was after a high-speed crash during a descent about 25km from the finish of the stage from Reggio Emilia to Rapallo on 3rd day of the Tour. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>

</tbody></table></div><div style="text-align: justify;">His death which the cycling world mourns brought memories for me of the equally tragic death of another cyclist, the young Italian Olympic gold medallist, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Casartelli">Fabio Casartelli</a>. He rode for the Motorola Cycling Team when I worked for Motorola and I happened to be at the stage at the Tour of France when he died. It was on another descent, that of the very steep Col de Portet d’Aspet during the 15th stage of the 1995 Tour de France. I had been with him that same morning before the start when the team were fooling about and we were all laughing. I shall never forget how I found out. I was in one of the team support cars with Fátima and Eddie, the Belgian soigneur, was driving. We were going towards the finish line ahead of the peloton and were out of the range of the race radio so wouldn’t have heard the news. A Belgian press car was going passed and stopped to tell us the news in French: “Fabio est mort” (Fabio has died). We stopped the car, not quite believing the news and were only confronted with reality when we reached the finish line. That was a terrible day for cycling and something I shall never forget. The next day Lance Armstrong, the team leader, with the blessing of the whole peloton, won the stage and dedicated the victory to his team mate Casartelli. Fátima and I could only watch it in on the TV in our bleak hotel room in Paris and cried our eyes out. We had left the mourning cycling world and felt orphaned and bereft watching this amazing gesture alone in Paris. Being part of something like that leaves a mark on you and so the sad news of the death of Vouter Weyland reminded me of that tragic day in the Tour de France. I used to be very close to the cycling world and so could understand how the cycling family will have felt at the Giro on Monday, bereft, just as Fátima and I felt in that hotel room in Paris in 1995. RIP Wouter, the cycling world will always remember you. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>

She has been visiting a psychiatric hospital and senior citizen residence this week as well as going to a meeting at the Madrid headquarters on Thursday. She has also worked from home quite a lot; something she will be encouraged to do with her new job. Now that’s a step in the right direction I certainly think.

It was the day of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/golf/13344400.stm">Seve Ballestero’s funeral</a> which I watched part of live. I was amazed to see the coverage on the BBC.

</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Just a few hours later, we heard that tragedy had struck the small town of Lorca in the province of Murcia in south east Spain. This town of some 90.000 inhabitants was hit by an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13371472">earthquake</a>. The first one of a magnitude of 4.4 hit the town early on Wednesday evening and around two hours later it was hit by a bigger one measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale. Murcia lies close to the large fault line where Europe and Africa meet. I didn’t know it but apparently Spain has hundreds of earthquakes every year, most of them being too small to be noticed. But this was the worst earthquake for Spain in 50 years, killing 9 people and destroying some 20.000 buildings. It has come as a huge shock to this country and was completely unexpected. We hear about earthquakes in other parts of the world and were shocked reading about Japan’s recent experience, but never believe it could happen here. The whole country has rallied around to help the town and the inhabitants affected. Some 20% of the people are immigrants and they are the ones you see mostly on the television in the make shift camps queuing for blankets and food. The local residents either have second homes or families nearby to go to. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>

</div><div style="text-align: justify;">As soon as I heard, I knew that at Yoigo we should do something to help. So I got in touch with my RSC colleague and friend Belén who soon organised an sms number for our customers to send messages to and donate the cost of the message. The text messages would be in the form of donations to the Red Cross. So if you are a Yoigo customer reading this, or even a customer of our competitors Orange or Movistar here in Spain, I urge you to send a message to 28077 with the text LORCA. You will contribute 1.20 euros which will go entirely to the Spanish Red Cross and will be used for aid for the people and town of Lorca. Thanks.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">All this bad news put a bit of a damper on me really this week and I didn’t pick up until the weekend. Yesterday, Saturday, was a good day, perhaps the best of this week. I went shopping with Suzy to Centro Oeste, a nearby shopping centre. I couldn’t resist some lovely bright red and bright green tight trousers at Zara which I shall be sharing with the girls. It’s nice to be able to do that these days I must say. In the evening I dragged Eladio back there with me to try on some white shorts at Zara which he didn’t like. We ended up buying him some very colourful bathing trunks at Cortefiel. As shopping makes you hungry we decided to go to dinner to one of our all time favourites at the nearby Equinoccio leisure centre, to <a href="http://www.la-alpargateria.com/">La Alpargatería</a>. As we got there early we were able to sit at our favourite corner table number 7. To our delight the menu has been improved with some delicious new dishes, such as the green tagliatelli with artichoke and ham I tried. True to habit, dessert was at Haagen Dazs afterwards. I mean they do have the best ice cream in the world don’t they?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">We were home early and could have watched the end of this year’s <a href="http://www.eurovision.tv/page/dusseldorf-2011">Eurovision Song Contest</a> but Eladio refused point blank. I didn’t insist as these days it’s just not what it used to be. The songs are more than lousy, Spain never wins and England doesn’t either these days. One of reasons is that countries near each other vote for their neighbours and neither England nor Spain have many so it’s nearly impossible to win. There was not much interest in the event this year as seems to be the tonic of the last 10 or 15 years. I used to enjoy it as a child and teenager but for me at least, it no longer has the magic it used to hold. I woke up to the news that Azerbaijan (and I had to google the name to know how to spell it!) had won which didn’t really excite me. The couple called Ell and Nikki who won will of course be delighted. You can listen to their song, Running Scared,  here on <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvZlEAP5Z28">You Tube</a> and judge for yourselves whether they deserved to win. One good thing for Ell and Nikki, a lot more people will now know how to spell their country’s name. Well done for winning this year’s contest.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>

</tbody></table></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Today as I write and think about him I have a lump in my throat. George was born with all the talents. He was tall, blonde, blue eyed, incredibly good looking, gentle and very talented at music, sport and languages. He excelled at them all but could not make a career of any of them because of drugs and later mental illness. He loved travelling and had the same “itchy feet” bug I have inherited from my Father. Life did not treat him fairly but I like to think he had his good moments when he was speaking to locals in some village in Afghanistan or Mexico or composing a song on his guitar or working out a piece of music on my grandmother’s old piano. I think one of his happiest moments was probably two years before he died when he married Sanya, his dear Serbian wife who sadly is no longer with us either. She died of a broken heart. RIP together dear George and Sanya. I carry you both in my heat always.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>

</div><div style="text-align: justify;">I don’t want to finish this week’s blogpost on a sad note, so let me tell you about the news from abroad I have had this week. On Monday I got a surprise email from someone I don’t know. It was from Andrea all the way from San Francisco. She is the niece of <a href="http://mashalloyd.blogspot.com/search/label/George%20Konzevich">George Konzevich</a> and his wife Valya, my parents’ friends, who I had written about here when George passed away in March this year. She had googled his name and up came my blog post. Isn’t the world a small place in these days of the internet I thought, and how marvellous that all these communication tools are available for people to keep in touch. Life would have been very different for George, Valya and my Mother, all of whom were refugees and had family all over the world with whom it was not possible to communicate with as it is for us today. And it was thanks to Internet too this week that I heard for the first time from my school friend Maggie W. since we left <a href="http://www.stjcc.co.uk/">St. Joseph’s College</a> in Bradford. Maggie it was great to get your news and know you are living in Edinburgh and have two grown up children like me. I do hope you will write again. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>

</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Maybe Maggie and Andrea will now read my blog too. I hope so. Well dear readers, I have come to the end of this week’s activities and will now leave you before we go for our daily walk and out to dinner with Roberto and Mari Carmen as we do most Sundays. I hope you all have a good week ahead of you and that mine this time will not be like the curate's egg; only good in parts. </div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cheers till next week</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>
