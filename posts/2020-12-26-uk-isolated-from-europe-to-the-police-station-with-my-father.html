Different right? Not so good of course but still Christmas. I'll be telling you about ours later. But first let me rewind to last Sunday.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As I have done, every Sunday, since Covid appeared in our lives, I record the latest global figures. I hope I won't have to carry on doing this for the whole of next year. I remember being alarmed when Spain recorded 1000 deaths. That was back in March. Today it is over 48.000. I never ever envisaged that. I am sad but also relieved that, so far, we have escaped the virus. But I wonder for how long. Will we be safe until we are inoculated. How long will we be immune once vaccinated? No one knows. We can only hope and keep safe meanwhile.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If last Sunday, the total death toll  was 1.692.114. Today that figure stands at 1.764.794. Last Sunday the total number of cases  was 76.6 million. Today that figure stands at just over 80 million. The US and Europe are the hot spots. I wonder why that is? Or is it because the US and Europe are reporting the correct numbers and other countries aren't? I don't believe the Chinese and Russian figures, nor do I believe the figures coming out of some of the most populated countries in the world such as Indonesia or Pakistan. No, I don't. On Monday we were pleased to hear the EU medical regulatory authority approved the Pfizer vaccine and it would be rolled out from today. Yes, today. Isn't that marvelous? Well, it would be if there were enough doses to go around and if everyone wants to be vaccinated. Not all do. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Last Sunday I was down in the doll drums. Christmas has helped but I still feel as if I am trapped in a wheel going round and round and not advancing. Every day seems the same. Does it feel the same for you? I feel in a rut but, to quote my friend Sandra, who told me off for complaining, I live in a nice rut. I do, it's true. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Last Sunday was quiet for us. We were horrified seeing people thronging the streets in Madrid and elsewhere doing their Christmas shopping or the 4000 or so so who attended a music concert here, even if all Covid measures were in place. I hate to think how the numbers are going to spike in January. Apart from one quiet shopping expedition with Oli weeks ago, I had done all my Christmas shopping online. It was a sunny day and we went for a quiet and pleasant walk. I made shepherds' pie for lunch. I spent most of the rest of the day watching Homeland. After finishing the excellent Season 7 (one of the best), missing Carrie and Saul so much, I returned to Season 1 to see Brody, etc. I was enthralled. I only interrupted my watching for a Skype call with my dear friends Sandra (in Brussels) and Adele (in Orleans, France). That was the highlight of my day. My girlfriends cheered me up. They always do.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, no one was feeling cheered up in my home country, the UK. After the bomb shell announcement by Boris Johnson on a clamp down on Christmas and full lockdown in London and the South East owing to the new and more infectious strain of Covid, we began to see the consequences. The new restrictions came into force that day but many flocked to airports and train stations on Saturday and Sunday to try and escape. Not many succeeded. Then came the bans on travelers from the UK. It was France who first imposed the ban. France included accompanied freight traffic. That literally isolated the UK from Europe and had huge consequences in goods entering the country. If you are worried about the vaccine, the Air Force was in place with military planes ready to fly it in. What a state of affairs. After France's announcement, many other countries followed suit and literally isolated the UK from the rest of Europe. No one wants the new strain to enter their countries but it may be too late as cases had already been detected in Denmark, Holland and Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden and Spain (4 cases detected yesterday). You know what? I felt sorry for my country. I really did. In the first wave of the virus it was China, then Italy and then Spain who were the countries pointed at. Today it is the UK and the US. It must have been a dreadful day for Boris Johnson dealing with this. But he also had on his plate the deal or no deal on leaving Europe. It was ironic really that the UK was shut off from the rest of Europe while it also looked like it might crash out with no deal on 31st December. The deadline for coming to an agreement passed again last Sunday and the two sides were still talking. So, as usual, the Brexit saga continued until finally a deal was struck, "in extremis" and announced on Christmas Eve.  But there was not much reason for cheer last Sunday.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On the home front, I had news from Oli that night about the squatters in Miguel's flat in Valencia. After the police refused to follow the judge's order to evict them, his lawyer requested permission from the judge to enter his flat to see what state it was in. Miguel was furious and saddened to know that they had got rid of (and probably sold) everything he owned except for the furniture. Getting compensation won't be easy, especially as the squatters will plead they have no funds. That's not true of course, as they had bought a new TV and playstation and own luxury cars. He would leave at 6 am on Monday morning to get to Valencia on time for the apparent leaving of the squatters. They had said they would leave at 10 am, one day before the "express" trial.  The trial never took place as the squatters left but Miguel is now accusing them of a bigger crime which may at some time come to trial and see proper justice done.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Monday came, the day my father and I were going to the police station to submit our papers to request the new post Brexit residency card for UK citizens in Spain (TIE card). It was a moment of mixed feelings and also a moment that made Brexit become real for us. It was indignant to have to take my 101 year old father to the police station to renew his residency card. I felt sick to the core when I thought how my father had fought in WW2 for unity in Europe and that because of Brexit he had to go through this ordeal when he should be looked after at home and not be dragged out to a police station at his age. Is there no provision for people his age or people who are sick or bed ridden. No, they have to go in person. That is the rule. So on Monday morning, we prepared my father for his first outing from the house since the pandemic began. I didn't feel good about him going out. It's very difficult for him to get in the car and Eladio has to almost lift up his whole body. It felt, to quote my cousin Katty in New Zealand, just so, so wrong. My friend Kathy in Yorkshire said it was diabolical. It was a very cold day, the first day of winter and we had to wrap my father up warm. We tried to put gloves on his arthritic hands and they wouldn't go on of course. Oh how cruel to have to take him to the police station. Eladio drove us to the police station in Carabanchel, a working class area outside Madrid. He double parked his car across the road and with great care and difficulty got my father out and into his wheel chair. I had to push his chair across the road and was very thankful to the policemen there who helped push it up the ramp. I don't think I could have done it on my own and Eladio wouldn't have been let in because of Covid. Once inside we had to wait just under 1 hour for our turn. I discretely took a photo of my dear father patiently waiting and probably wondering what was going on or what the world was coming to. I say discretely because there were signs on the wall not to use mobile phones. But I was damned if I wasn't going to record this unpleasant historic moment. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjOBWJwbGyTqHX3h5xQtjMrwmqIcH3ta9mf1Yav_cSOC7DfmBt9HeK9LKuH8pX_0iTvnp7vFDDL0oe2A50vh9WcjslaO3w0hrz3nwLG8kpbaFfrdwX4yB3Qbp7VdiMwrf8ZQn1OIQ/s2543/Monday+Daddy+Police.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjOBWJwbGyTqHX3h5xQtjMrwmqIcH3ta9mf1Yav_cSOC7DfmBt9HeK9LKuH8pX_0iTvnp7vFDDL0oe2A50vh9WcjslaO3w0hrz3nwLG8kpbaFfrdwX4yB3Qbp7VdiMwrf8ZQn1OIQ/w195-h400/Monday+Daddy+Police.jpg" width="195"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My dear poor father waiting at the police station on Monday morning. It was oh so wrong</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">When our turn was finally called and thankfully I had managed an appointment one after the other, I wheeled my father to the right desk. We were well treated by the clerk there. While handing over all the papers, it felt like some sort of betrayal, betrayal from our birth country because of Brexit. I told the clerk with tears coming down my face that my father had fought in WW2. He was impressed and very sympathetic, bless the man. Not many clerks are. The appointment was to submit the papers but we would have to go back to get the new card. I asked if I could somehow avoid my father coming again and my wish was granted. The way round this was not to fingerprint my father - another indignity for which I was very grateful. In any case I don't think they would have managed with his arthritic fingers. They had problems with mine so imagine with my father. As you get older the prints fade and it was extremely difficult to get mine recorded with the little machine they were using. In the end they had to use my ring finger and middle finger rather than my index finger. Thankfully all our documents were in order - I never told the clerk I had forged my father's signature on the forms - and we were out about 1.5h after arriving. I have to ask for an appointment for after 2nd February to collect our cards that will guarantee our permanent residency status in Spain. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">We were home very shortly aftewards thank goodness. On the way I got good news from Oli; well good and bad. That morning when Miguel and his brother arrived from Madrid to witness the possible departure of the squatters from their flat, they had already gone. Gone too were all his belongings, everything he owned there, apart from the furniture. Miguel and Olivia were very relieved that within a week they had managed to get the squatters to go. They were devastated though about all his possessions which included his coffee machine, TV, music set, diving equipment, clothes and all his household goods. He said it did not feel like his home anymore. During the day he and his brother decided either to rent it or to sell it. Once the squatters had left they had to change the lock, put in an alarm and set about seeking compensation for the robbery and the costs incurred by the squatters. Miguel has insurance but it doesn't cover theft if you have been away from your home for more than a month. Well, he hasn't been able to go back because of Covid. He may or may not get compensation but we have to look on the bright side and be happy that the squatters were evicted in what must be record time. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Oli took the day off again as she had Elliot to take care of and the nursery doesn't open until 7 am while she has to be at work at 5 am. Thus she took him to the nursery at about 9 and was free for the rest of the day. She was home briefly and then out for lunch with a friend. She was happy that day and so were we. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">It was a great tonic to talk to my cousin Katty in New Zealand that day. New Zealand, being pretty cut off from the rest of the world, is pretty Covid free and they are living a very normal life. She can hardly believe what is happening in Europe and especially in the UK where she lived as a young girl. It was also a tonic to talk to our great friends Kathy and Phil in Yorkshire. Oh how I pine for Yorkshire. They pine for Spain. We can't wait to see each other again. That day was probably one of the worst days in history for the UK what with the blockade with Europe, the problem of freight and of course Brexit looming and still no agreement. We could hardly talk about anything else I'm afraid but at least we had the odd laugh. Laughter is always a great cure when you are down or depressed and Kathy always makes me laugh. Love you my love.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Elliot was home in the afternoon and after my Facetime call with Kathy and Phil, I turned my attention to him. He was playing in the lounge but was much more interested in "my toys" than his. My toys are of course the ornaments we have and the Christmas decorations. The lounge looked like a bomb had hit it by the end of the evening. I quickly cleared everything away - I hate a mess - and tried to think of something for dinner. Oli suggested scrambled eggs, always a good option.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Once again I had to get in the bath with my grandson. It was fun really, splashing and playing with his ducks hahaha. His father had bought him some new extra warm pyjamas as he thinks our house is cold - Eladio always has the temperature on at 22c - and because Elliot always sleeps without a blanket or cover. He looked very funny as they were far too big for him. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjEuP9-sFxW_3Q6x4I_3jw_dCTWARFGQM2dUxyiaTbG4aWkEj1ojArW-RrUxegg7jUu-hVH-r-IpEys_RMgbePd7pUhHl02YS-BM94JQ3HloVE2Xk1crSQr2bm5vrDYGBEql5kZmg/s2048/Monday+Elliot+big+pyjamas.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjEuP9-sFxW_3Q6x4I_3jw_dCTWARFGQM2dUxyiaTbG4aWkEj1ojArW-RrUxegg7jUu-hVH-r-IpEys_RMgbePd7pUhHl02YS-BM94JQ3HloVE2Xk1crSQr2bm5vrDYGBEql5kZmg/w244-h400/Monday+Elliot+big+pyjamas.jpg" width="244"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Elliot's big and warm pyjamas</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">When Eladio called Suzy, she was able to see her nephew and asked whether he was wearing a space suit. It certainly looked like it. She was very happy that day as her new bosses were very pleased with her first translation work. It was a 90 page document. They told her she had done a great job. We were happy for her. Finally Elliot went to bed and we were able to watch the tail end of the news and then relax with Netflix.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">Tuesday came, the day of the Spanish Christmas lottery draw, a huge event here. I was up at 6 am in the morning and was soon joined by Olivia. That day her programme would be dedicated to reporting on the lottery.  I waited for it all morning and also waited to see whether we had won anything. We didn't I'm afraid. Other people did though and it was  joy to see people celebrating. It was lovely too that El Gordo was the main news in Spain that day after all the gloom and doom.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Gloom and doom continued in the UK but there was light at the end of the tunnel when the French and British authorities came to an agreement to unblock the frontier, letting lorries through. They could do so as from Wednesday so long as they provided a negative Covid test, not an easy feat for all those European lorry drivers stuck near Dover. I read there were up to 10.000 lorries stuck in England, 3000 of them from Spain. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhgwKf8IeBSpNhMf1gRK0rbW32HzKi2MIZuhFylvrX5ysZlsWSJDd2BZPIm-hmzreoFCOd7ZoRETFzuvBfsh4P34-7isA7e9bhmqS-ikLntwyCRnHQmVDpvwQ_Q-gBBRLERIeRhgg/s1600/skynews-lorry-brexit-kent_5215690.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhgwKf8IeBSpNhMf1gRK0rbW32HzKi2MIZuhFylvrX5ysZlsWSJDd2BZPIm-hmzreoFCOd7ZoRETFzuvBfsh4P34-7isA7e9bhmqS-ikLntwyCRnHQmVDpvwQ_Q-gBBRLERIeRhgg/w400-h225/skynews-lorry-brexit-kent_5215690.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Lorries stuck in Kent this week</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">As there are thousands of them, it was very doubtful they would be able to be on the move on time to join their families for Christmas. My heart went out to them. Meanwhile much of their cargo if it was fresh produce will be rotten by now. People in the UK worried of shortages rushed to the supermarkets to load up, just as many people did in the first wave. This bottleneck can be seen as a picture of what Brexit without a deal could bring or when it comes into full force, I got a glimpse of that on Monday at the police station. Oh, what a mess.</div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">At home we have no issues with supplies so with a house full of food, lunch was made and life continued as usual. We had a nice dinner together too - fresh artichokes, croquettes and ham washed down by Rioja wine. Oli is a great lover of that Spanish tapa, "croquetas" and I was tempted by an ad on Facebook for gourmet croquettes coming from a company called "la cocreta" - named so as many people pronounce the name wrong. My box of 24 duly arrived that day. They were supposed to be for Christmas Eve but as we would have more than enough food, I fried a few of them for our dinner. They were delicious. I could never make them as well. This was the box.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJl0QU8VqcqCgDKWZ6_y8Sy1x6xfOWPsfBhso011JdVg1lcQ-VqvtjEF4lfoAXcLzqmzod7CzCbHCZ2z5Gfj3NV2PQrg7d_iBlYHy9uTNiBndJMzqJZ_valcM9Y_oe5F1x-hj1Ww/s2543/Tuesday+La+Cocreta.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJl0QU8VqcqCgDKWZ6_y8Sy1x6xfOWPsfBhso011JdVg1lcQ-VqvtjEF4lfoAXcLzqmzod7CzCbHCZ2z5Gfj3NV2PQrg7d_iBlYHy9uTNiBndJMzqJZ_valcM9Y_oe5F1x-hj1Ww/w400-h195/Tuesday+La+Cocreta.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My box of gourmet croquettes</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Suzy, all the way away in Costa Rica and 7 hours behind us, wanted a bit of talk time with her mother. We hadn't spoken for ages. So we tried that day to skype. It doesn't always work as it depends on her having a good connection. But we made it that night. Here is my lovely daughter who seems to be in good spirits these days. She is especially happy with her new job - translating which will help supplement her income from teaching English. Thanks Jacky again for your help giving her the right tools. Her "bosses" (an American couple) were delighted with the job she did. I was delighted with their praise.

As Oli had to be up at 4.30 the next morning, it was up to Eladio and I to put him to bed - no mean task. We sent Oli to sleep at 9.30 and then the baby was our responsibility. It's been more than 35 years since we had babies the same age but we still obviously have the skills. Elliot eludes sleep and is very active in the evenings. I remember singing my girls to sleep so that's what we did. I held him in my arms in bed while Eladio sang. I then took him to his cot and he immediately protested and started a tantrum. I repeated the process and then I took him again. He protested of course, but I insisted and kept on singing - Sing a song of Sixpence. Every time he cried, I did not lift him out of the cot, but stroked him and soothed him with the song. It worked! Eladio said it was a miracle. He then slept right through the night and didn't hear his mother leave at 4.45 in the morning.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">He woke up just as his father arrived at about 8.15, to take him to the nursery. It was my joy and privilege to be the one to pick him up and he clung to me with love and sleepiness which is when I most love him. I soon handed him to his father who he must have missed.

That would be the greatest Christmas present for the UK and parting gift from the EU. The blockade at the port in Dover continued when tests started on lorry drivers but they would not be back home on time for Christmas. Meanwhile the news about Covid was dire with nearly 40.000 new cases in the UK that day and the announcement of many more counties moving into Tier 4 from Boxing Day. There was also news of yet another new and more contagious strain of the virus which apparently comes from South Africa. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In Spain the numbers were not good either but not as high as in the UK, Italy, France or Germany, but alarming too. We have yet to know  whether the vaccine will work on the new strains. It's not that clear.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">But life went on here in our quiet house. That morning we did our last shopping before Christmas as I wanted to avoid the crowds on 24th December. Friends in my circle, especially from the UK, were asking me whether we celebrate the "Continental way" - i.e. Christmas Eve dinner, or the British way on Christmas day. Well, friends and readers, being a great fan of Christmas and a mixed Anglo Spanish family, we do both. Want to know what we had for dinner on Christmas Eve and for lunch on Christmas Day?  This is the men:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Christmas Eve menu: bacon rolls, potato salad with giant prawns, perushki (small Russian meat pies made with puff pastry), vol au vent with tuna fish spread, foie gras and croquettes.

A meal at Christmas wouldn't be the same without them.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We were alone on Thursday and apart from our food shopping outing, we didn't go out again. It was foggy, cold and damp. I spent most of my free time watching more of Homeland. Oh how I love Carrie and Brody and Saul of course.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Christmas Eve came and you know what? It still didn't feel Christmassy, however much I tried with the food preparation and decorations. That's because of Covid. We spent the day waiting for the announcement of the Brexit deal. There were rumours it was ready to be announced but there were lots of last minute glitches. I hoped and prayed there would be one and even if it wasn't perfect it would be better than crashing out. The evidence for the latter was there as the thousands of lorry drivers remained stuck in Kent, nearly all of whom spent Christmas Eve in their lorries. As I said, I felt very sorry for them.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I was awake and up by 5.30 am in the morning. Crazy right? Well, I had lots to do, all food preparations for our Christmas Eve dinner. Very soon after breakfast I was making the trifle and the potato salad. I was worried the jelly would take ages to settle but it didn't. I learned many years ago not to add any tropical food such as pineapple which prevents settling. Much better is to add strawberries or raspberries. I never put in alcohol - some do - but it't not in my traditional trifle. Here is the result my friends. It's news as I only ever make it once a year.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4BhwZNC_ie_RFRdTY1hRxTyK5qNIEbIlKacvcCnNcIRPHCC_HBLnNHz0CP5qvMLacgZjqTSGaAkAHSF2b4pTb-krMCxxt0A2R5B662Lufp6TFG0yPincD_i-Mh6ofKE42jwhoVA/s2543/Trifle.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4BhwZNC_ie_RFRdTY1hRxTyK5qNIEbIlKacvcCnNcIRPHCC_HBLnNHz0CP5qvMLacgZjqTSGaAkAHSF2b4pTb-krMCxxt0A2R5B662Lufp6TFG0yPincD_i-Mh6ofKE42jwhoVA/w400-h195/Trifle.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My trifle</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">The potato salad took longer as there are loads of ingredients. These are: potatoes, carrots, peas, chopped spring onion, hard boiled eggs, prawns and home made mayonnaise. I had forgotten to buy the spring onion so when we went to pick up the croissants for our breakfast on Christmas morning, we got them then. We also had a coffee and I had a little mini cream and strawberry tartlet (yummy) at Alverán, our favourite local bakery. It began to feel like Christmas as Eladio and I walked the streets. We came home for me to finish the potato salad. This is the result friends. I may remind you it is a recipe I inherited from my mother who always told me she got it from her father who got it from a Swiss cookery book. We love it.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjYdSNBOe_ddljsI2n1ZVgyOy9vTwsrnKhck9gshlNX_c1_icUPd2v1hOLV3oBgYmuJrDXach2ZlIDJ5HHgPbYlzt24GfnUi8bGfaEMD1-7WhCr-B7NngbTyQEuzp4dlVq-ZeoqZw/s2543/potato+salad.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjYdSNBOe_ddljsI2n1ZVgyOy9vTwsrnKhck9gshlNX_c1_icUPd2v1hOLV3oBgYmuJrDXach2ZlIDJ5HHgPbYlzt24GfnUi8bGfaEMD1-7WhCr-B7NngbTyQEuzp4dlVq-ZeoqZw/w400-h195/potato+salad.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My potato salad</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It's not traditional Christmas fare either here or in the UK or anywhere else for that matter, but it is a dish we always have on special days. In Spain people go more for roast lamb or suckling pig, fillet steak and very many go for expensive fish or seafood. I heard this week that "merluza" (hake), popular at Christmas was going for 48 euros a kilo when it normally costs about 18 or 20. Crazy right? Prices go up a lot here for meat and fish the days before Christmas. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I got on with the rest of the food preparations and really had little left to make in the afternoon. Oli joined us for lunch and we had leftovers. I was damned if I was going to cook for lunch too. Besides, we couldn't eat much as we had to save our appetites for dinner. Meanwhile, Eladio got on with his yearly Christmas task which is to light the fire in the TV lounge or library as we sometimes call it. You know it's Christmas Eve when it is lit. I do wish he could light it more often. I love the coziness of it. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxMeHBvGuAZrsjLq93cS_PKFdjQfHDUb2_Pj8kZIS90rjVQ0oUYEzN6MglA8Pg9yQ9nB8JsT1RnjiGBUIJ1BiU0cCqr3qYeYF3cZ02gzjqSDcc-uaDQKc1KzC5u48QBwWMovOMHw/s2543/fire+place.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxMeHBvGuAZrsjLq93cS_PKFdjQfHDUb2_Pj8kZIS90rjVQ0oUYEzN6MglA8Pg9yQ9nB8JsT1RnjiGBUIJ1BiU0cCqr3qYeYF3cZ02gzjqSDcc-uaDQKc1KzC5u48QBwWMovOMHw/w400-h195/fire+place.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The fire was lit on Christmas Eve</i></td></tr></tbody></table><i><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div></i><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Soon we were joined by Elliot and Miguel which put an end to our siesta or time I would have liked to dedicate to Carry, Saul and Brody in Homeland. No way José with Elliot around. With their arrival, our family for this year's Christmas was complete. We were just 6 people, counting Zena, my father's weekend carer, so adhered to the Christmas Covid restrictions. I hope everyone else did. We were in our Covid bubble as is right. Thankfully, thus, we didn't have to wear masks or open the windows. I felt sorry for other people who couldn't be with their loved ones because of the restrictions but they are there for a reason. Yes, the vaccine is coming but it is not coming fast. One loved one was missing though, Suzy. It was the first time in our lives that she hasn't been with us for Christmas. We sorely missed her but were lucky to have our grandson with us and Oli and Miguel, not to mention my father. It is a privilege that he is still here with us. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was in the middle of the afternoon that the last minute Brexit deal was announced. It couldn't have come at a better time, Christmas Eve. I hate Brexit and the fact that the UK has left the EU but I didn't want to see my birth country crash out with all the dreadful consequences. It is nowhere near an ideal deal but at least it will mean free trade; not really freedom of movement though which I think is the worst thing to come out of Brexit. Hopefully I shall have free movement in the EU when I eventually get a Spanish passport. Of course both sides announced victory. It was a bitter sweet moment. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Soon it was time to lay the Christmas table, a job I love. I try to make it as festive as possible. I found some fun green Christmas hats which we would all wear.

This year there were fewer from our side but, my goodness, Oli and Miguel made up for any of my lacking. How generous of them. I think every household is different when it comes to the timing of present giving. I have always followed my paternal grandmother's traditions and ours come after breakfast. She always used to give a stocking to George and I for when we woke up and, until this year, I continued the tradition with the girls. Oli broke the rule by giving a present to Elliot before breakfast and I relented. I mean, if this is a different sort of Christmas, traditions can be broken.

I usually wear a party dress. This year I chose my black lace one with a hint of orange or  red from the petticoat underneath. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Soon the present giving started. We missed Suzy who usually is the one to hand them out. This year one of the presents I got for my father was the autobiography of the now famous "Captain Tom" - the 100 year old who walked to fund raise for the NHS during the first wave of the pandemic and who is now Sir Captain Tom. Being my father's contemporary and both having fought in WW2, I thought his story might interest my father. I think it did as he was reading it shortly afterwards.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAhzO4-otO5TM1EKCCOOEM_HQ-PmIoz6zOWcNBRu6LMZHS_ADaIyYKuqdai7HARgC6gf3y4zWiiOk1qScQ5hQaRMJQdUiik4TO6H9ckDwliGuQNqkwfv18owdAhyphenhyphenhSKh6sMvztzQ/s2016/My+father+Captain+Tom.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAhzO4-otO5TM1EKCCOOEM_HQ-PmIoz6zOWcNBRu6LMZHS_ADaIyYKuqdai7HARgC6gf3y4zWiiOk1qScQ5hQaRMJQdUiik4TO6H9ckDwliGuQNqkwfv18owdAhyphenhyphenhSKh6sMvztzQ/w225-h400/My+father+Captain+Tom.jpg" width="225"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Photo with my father on Christmas morning with one of his presents, Captain Tom's book</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">While posing for the picture, I thought that my own best present was still having my 101 year old father with me.

I was able to join Eladio and the dogs on a much needed walk while Zena had an eye on the oven. We changed clothes for the walk and I wore the lovely Oysho Christmas jumper Oli had bought me. The sun glasses were a present from her too.</div></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEipEixs87HvBEzYTiyLQF1as5KiiRPK_Wexee6Cs8BZulgXOcHPI0GcugbqwgvOLKqXZKGmdZvyLiyYTmI-oa8jwsnDOA9ealFvFkSgnRJZpslVbcGkEwJFfupJhyphenhyphenkNl0rRvZSZpg/s2543/walk+new+jumper.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEipEixs87HvBEzYTiyLQF1as5KiiRPK_Wexee6Cs8BZulgXOcHPI0GcugbqwgvOLKqXZKGmdZvyLiyYTmI-oa8jwsnDOA9ealFvFkSgnRJZpslVbcGkEwJFfupJhyphenhyphenkNl0rRvZSZpg/w400-h195/walk+new+jumper.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Going on our walk  and wearing my new Christmas jumper</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">It was all hands on deck when I got back to make sure our lunch was perfect and it was. We ate too much of course. It's the Christmas pudding that finishes me off and the chocolates. Miguel and Elliot were having lunch at his parents, so we were all able to enjoy a nice long siesta afterwards. I couldn't sleep and was happy to continue watching Homeland. I did not miss the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL9JR0A4yCU">Queen's speech</a> though. How could I? Her speech is a constant in my life at Christmas and long may that last. Her speech is always apolitical as it should be and not scrutinised for political nuances as the King's speech is here in Spain. And, unlike the King of Spain, The Queen's speech is just never criticised by the media. It shouldn't be as she is there as a figure of unity. Her speech always brings me comfort. It is always uplifting and this year it was, unusually for her, somewhat emotional too. I loved it as I loved the video put together with the Horse Guards playing the National Anthem on horseback. Wow. That set the tone and sent shivers down my spine, shivers of patriotism I must admit, patriotism I will soon be betraying, albeit on paper only, when I get Spanish nationality due to Brexit. Oh don't get me going on that. So back to the broadcast. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">She never mentioned the words Covid, pandemic or Coronavirus, but they were there everywhere in her speech. Her main messages were how well people have risen to the occasion, and that we are not alone - how right she is - Her belief in God is what has kept her going but I loved her references to the religions over the world, the story of the Good Samaritan (such as Captain Tom) and also how we would all love a hug or a squeeze of the hand this Christmas. That is the most emotional she has ever got I think. It is the first time she is not with the rest of the family so I really do think she knows what others are feeling. She spoke about the light, it was her main theme, the light of the star that led the shepherd's to Jesus, the lights of the Diwali festival and how light will bring us a better future, or at least, that is what I understood. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"> The only photo present in the video was one of Prince Philip. Oh, how much he means to her. I wonder if she ever could have done her job without him beside her? To think the Queen is now 94, yet is as articulate as she was when she first became our sovereign. She has aged very very well. She was a beautiful woman and I think she is now too a beautiful old woman. Whether you like her dress sense or not, she always looks her best. I also loved the Joy for the World song sung by the NHS choir afterwards. For her they were the Good Samaritans too and so they are. P.S. Did you notice how at the beginning of the broadcast the title is "The Queen"? I reflected on that and tend to agree, Her Majesty, is that. She is The Queen, there is no other Queen like her. </div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjymdZ2qHdoS-LP_R94i2jf6KQBjucG6d4emsmFBDYtrzs063GKg4MTXAQgAAApgowz4bfDRl3U3Rua4wgiLNklvNsfnT8dlxeTTiYt2IlnujwqBX3zpLnv-TuejHHRp_t11ccU7Q/s2048/queen.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="265" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjymdZ2qHdoS-LP_R94i2jf6KQBjucG6d4emsmFBDYtrzs063GKg4MTXAQgAAApgowz4bfDRl3U3Rua4wgiLNklvNsfnT8dlxeTTiYt2IlnujwqBX3zpLnv-TuejHHRp_t11ccU7Q/w400-h265/queen.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Queen in the recording of this year's speech. Marvelous. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">By the time I had digested the speech and made Eladio and Oli listen to it, Miguel and Elliot were back. Thus it was grandparent playtime with Elliot. I had bought him a wooden bench with a hammer and xylophone and even a bath bubble making machine. He preferred the former and was much entertained by it as he is with all my Christmas decorations, oh dear. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We all said we weren't hungry and didn't want any dinner but at about 9.45 pm, we were hitting the fridge to find the Christmas Eve leftovers and tucking into potato salad and even the trifle and chocolates. So once again we went to bed with very heavy stomachs. Christmas shouldn't be all about eating but it is and I am one of the main culprits.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Saturday was Boxing Day and it was probably the quietest ever. Oli and family left us just after we came back from our walk. They were off to lunch at Elenita's and would then go back to their flat. We won't see them again until New Year's Eve. The house seemed so quiet afterwards. Lunch, true to Boxing Day traditions, was leftovers of our Christmas Day lunch, followed by trifle. Dinner was leftovers too but today there are none left, so damn it, I shall have to cook again. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Today looks like it will be equally quiet. It is cold  but the sun is forecast to come out making our walk more pleasant. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">When I write next Sunday it will already be 2021. I can only hope it will be a better year than 2020. Did you ever imagine in your lifetime that you would live through a global pandemic? I didn't. I want to see this through though and come out safe. I am hoping against hope that the new vaccines will play their part in that happening. Today in Spain the vaccinations are starting and hopefully by the summer enough people will be immune so as to be able to resume normal life as we knew it this time a year ago. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Keep safe my friends,</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Happy New Year</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Masha. </div><div><div><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
