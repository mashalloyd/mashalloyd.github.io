<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">What a week it has been in all senses, full of

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Monday the
world woke up to hear that Hugo Chavez’s successor <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-22160684">Nicolas Maduro had won the elections in Venezuela</a> but by a very small margin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>His opponent, Hector Capriles, called for a
recount after 3000 or so “incidents” in the voting which the new Government
rejected and later in the week Maduro was sworn in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>There have been protests every since and it
remains to be seen how the situation will progress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It is certainly a questionable victory that
the democratic countries are not happy with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I for one would have liked to have seen an audit take place.</span></div>

enjoying dinner that night outside, albeit a very frugal meal for me as Monday
was my fasting day, the news was breaking about <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/9996363/Boston-Marathon-explosions-live.html">bombs at the Boston Marathon</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We were amazed to hear on TV
in bed later how homemade bombs, using pressure cookers (the Spanish Fagor
brand), killed three people and injured and maimed for life many of the
spectators and runners.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I mean
terrorism, if that’s what it was – and we didn’t know at the time – just
doesn’t go with sport.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The news
continued through the week of the repercussions of the terror and how the US
police and FBI finally caught up with the culprits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They were two young brothers, Tamerlan
Tsarnaev and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, of Chechen origin aged 26 and 19. They were
spied on the public cameras wearing black and white caps and people who knew
them identified them immediately and alerted the authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It is yet to be found out why they targeted
the Boston Marathon, one of the big five, and it will be some time before we
know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Tamerlan is now dead after a
shooting fight with the police and his younger brother who managed to get away
but was caught a while later, was shot in the throat and is clinging for life
in a Boston hospital and obviously because of the wound will be unable to talk for
sometime if he recovers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">There have
been articles about Tamerlan and Dzhokhar, but one which caught my attention
was written by David Remnick and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2013/04/29/130429ta_talk_remnick">published in The New Yorker</a> and analyses the
story behind the woes of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya">Chechen</a> people and the story of the Tsarnaev family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It all boils down to Stalin who in the middle
of the second world war declared this region’s people disloyal to the USSR and
banished them from their homeland in the northern Caucasus to Central Asia and
Siberia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Many did survive but the
Tsarnaev family finally found themselves in Kyrgyzstan and some ten years ago
moved to the US.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The rest of the story
you know, how Tamerlan did not adapt and yearned for his roots and eventually
became a fundamentalist. He committed this awful crime and is now dead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>And you know what? I just think it is all the
fault of one of the worst dictators to ever walk the earth, Joseph Stalin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>If you think Hitler was worse, talk to my
Father who knows his history and will tell you that the latter devil massacred
many more people than the former some of whom were Chechens and whose ancestors
bear a grudge still today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In my
readings to document this story, I was fascinated to find out that Chechens who
turned to Islam in the 15<sup>th</sup> century, speak Russian with a thick
accent and that their own language is called “Noxchiin Mott”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I wonder whether the two now famous brothers
who perpetrated the horror of the Boston Marathon spoke that language or
whether they were more familiar with English after having spent their formative
years and done all their schooling in the US, the true melting pot of the world
and supposed bastion of democracy.</span></div>

thinking about the Boston bombings but busy at the office in the morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Tuesday was also the day the news of this
year’s Pulitzer prizes was announced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
was happy to hear that a Spaniard, <a href="http://manubrabo.com/">Manu Brabo</a>, had won the <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2013-Breaking-News-Photography">Breaking  News Photography prize</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The prize was awarded
to him and his team from the Associated Press for their “compelling coverage of
the civil war in Syria, producing memorable images under extreme hazard”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You can see the <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/works/2013-Breaking-News-Photography">full collection here</a>, but the
one that stands out most is of a Syrian man crying whilst holding the body of
his son.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It was on
Tuesday afternoon that I found out we would be having an English neighbour.
Imagine that for me!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>As I came back from
an errand, I met two women just outside the house next door which has been on
sale for quite a few years now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It has
been difficult to sell not just because of the crisis but because the house,
more of a shell really, is unfinished and will need a lot of work and money to
become a proper home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We began to talk
in Spanish and I immediately recognized the English accent of one of the
women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Kate too was very surprised and
pleased and told me she had made an offer for the house and that it had been
accepted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I invited my new English
neighbour and her friend in for a “nice cup of tea” on our outside dining room
table and here we introduced ourselves properly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Kate is a teacher of English at a local
school and is married to a Spaniard, like me of course which tickled us both
pink.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Her husband is from the north of
Spain and works in the telecoms market the same as me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So they are just like us; an English woman
married to a Spaniard and with similar professions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In their case she is the teacher and in my
case Eladio is the teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I look
forward to their moving in and having an English neighbour and hopefully a
friend but I think it will take some time because of the work needed doing on
their new house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Many of us
have been following the news of her death and not unsurprisingly the nation was
divided in its sentiment as it was during her premiership and indeed for much
of her life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>There were those who
mourned her death and those who celebrated it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I am sort of in the middle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was
a teenager when she came to power and I lived through the major events when she
governed such as the Miners’ strikes, when she removed the school milk
allowance and was called “Thatcher the milk snatcher”, the bomb attack on her
own life during one of the Conservative Party conferences, the war with
Argentina over the Falklands and of course her downfall which had much to do
with the proposal of the “poll tax”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
think she became just a little too regal or full of herself especially towards
the end of her last government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So yes,
she did some good things and some bad things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>She will be very much remembered for some amazing public speaking and
celebratory quotes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I think the most
famous quote of all is when she said “the lady’s not for turning” at a
Conservative Party Conference in 1980.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It has now become a Thatcherite motto and even a name to describe
Baroness Thatcher which is why I have chosen it for this week’s headline.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The full declaration was the following: “you
turn if you want to” but “the lady’s not for turning” in reference to her
opposition to the liberalization of the economy that her predecessor, Ted or
Edward Heath had urged. Another quote I read this week and loved was this:
“Being powerful is like being a lady.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>If
you have to tell people you are, you aren’t”.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"> More trivia
that day for you, but important for me: my new Clarks red and blue shoes
ordered online the day before arrived just as the dogs were having their baths.
So why is that important you may ask? Well, I have ungainly and funnily shaped
feet, rather too wide and cannot wear dainty shoes to be found in the shops
here for Spanish women with elegant feet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Clarks, the good old English shoemaker, makes shoes which are good for
imperfect feet like mine; i.e. they are slightly wider and generally more
comfortable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I needed some blue shoes
and some red shoes to go with all the new outfits I keep buying and this week I
found just what I wanted on </span><a href="http://www.clarks.es/"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">www.clarks.es</span></a><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">,
shoes in those colours with medium sized heels which would fit the bill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>And they arrived on Wednesday and were a
perfect fit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>All I can say is 10/10 for
Clarks for making shoes that are nice (not beautiful but pretty enough), that
fit me, are not too expensive and are delivered almost for free the day after
purchasing them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

photo below on FB I got comments from ex Nokia colleagues to say that didn’t
happen to Nokia phones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I don’t know if
it does but it is true that I never broke the screen of any of my Nokia
phones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I am lucky I work in the
industry as I soon got a replacement phone whilst mine is being mended.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But I decided I didn’t want it to happen
again because of the fuss of restoring all the information, pictures and
applications which can take a few hours and went in search of a full
cover.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I went to the Apple store at Gran
Plaza 2 but didn’t find anything suitable there. In the end it was at The Phone
House that I found a lovely white leather case which is now protecting my
replacement phone.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">One good thing
about being busy on Thursday, my second fast day of the week, is that it took
my mind off food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had to be in the
office for a meeting with my boss to go over an important agenda for next
Monday and to discuss some other important upcoming projects I am responsible for.
Some of the items discussed at the meeting had me working a lot of this weekend,
but I do not mind. I hardly distinguish my work time from my private time and
always prefer to have lots of projects to deal with being the busy bee I am.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">That evening,
Eladio and I went out for dinner as we often do on Friday nights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The restaurant we went to was new and one
that had been recommended by Juana for a lunch engagement some of my ex Nokia
women colleagues and I will be having next month.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But intrigued by her recommendation, we
decided to try out <a href="http://todosobremadrid.com/donde-comer/restaurante-xa-casa-picon/ficha-fotos">Xa Casa Picón</a> in Majadahonda on Friday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The pretty building it is housed in is one I
am very familiar with having driven past it many times and one I have always
liked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It used to be a furniture shop
but is now a restaurant. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>It certainly
lived up to our expectations and also the positive reviews I had seen on
Foursquare and Trip Advisor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We will
definitely going back if only for the “salmorejo” which was out of this world.</span></div>

Suzy went off to a rural hotel near Avila with her Russian friend who we call

were invited out to dinner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Olivia’s
boyfriend, Miguel, invited the three of us out to dinner for a belated
celebration of his birthday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We went to
a great place called <a href="http://www.lamision.es/sibara.htm">Sibara</a> in Majadahonda.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>They serve fish and chips amongst other things and which of course I
chose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was a good occasion to get to
know Miguel a little better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Apart from
being an engineer and cameraman for TVE he is a keen sportsman and especially
loves swimming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In May he will be
swimming the 30km stretch between Ibiza and Formentera which will take him some
10 hours to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I don’t think I could
even swim for an hour without stopping so am very impressed with his new
challenge.</span></div>

right now will be finishing an exam for a fixed job in Melilla with TVE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She works for TVE but does not have a fixed
