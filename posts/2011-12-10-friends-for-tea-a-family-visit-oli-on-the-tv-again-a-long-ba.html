<span>Hello again</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>I’m sorry for not writing last Sunday but I
think you will excuse me when you see just how busy I have been since I last
wrote.  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>Let me start from where I left off.  It was Sunday 27<sup>th</sup> November and a
special day at home as we were expecting visitors.  Rocío, the girls’ best friend, came to
afternoon tea with her parents Esmeralda and Juan Ignacio.  Juan is the doctor at my Father’s hospital
who has been looking after his every need since he first fell ill.  To show our gratitude, we invited them to our
home and I went all out in making a splendid English cum Spanish platter of
food, including Rioja and Port wine and of course the proverbial pot of English
Typhoo tea.  The photo below is of us all
enjoying the occasion.  Oli is not in the
photo as she joined us later. We have so much in common with Rocío’s parents
that I trust one day we will be become proper friends.  As you know, most of our “couple” friends
live abroad or outside Madrid and the only ones who live near us have just
divorced, so we are well in need of a local replacement.  The same goes for my girlfriends; they all
live abroad or far away.  That is a bit
of a sad reflection actually.</span><br></br>

<span>I mentioned my Father’s health and you may want
to know how he is these days.  In reality
his life hasn’t changed very much, habit wise, in that he still enjoys his
English newspapers, his books and the BBC news as well as his food and
chocolates (oh yes he is a chocolate freak!) but of course he is now bound to a
wheel chair.  He was making progress with
walking again using a zimmer but unfortunately he developed a bed sore on his
heel which is now heavily bandaged and on the mend but it means he cannot even
try to walk until it gets better and that could take months.  On the bright side, he is recovering the
movement in his right hand which had suffered from a small stroke.  He goes to physiotherapy three or four times
a week in the afternoons to Juan’s hospital and they are doing a grand job with
him.  Olga tells us he is very popular in
the hospital because he is such an “English gentleman” and everyone calls him
“Charlés” with the accent on the “es”. 
His real name is Charles Courtenay Lloyd and he is known as Courtenay
but I have given up trying to explain that to anyone in Spain for obvious
pronunciation reasons. So I was very happy the other day when he asked me for a
pen to do the Daily Telegraph crossword. 
He can now write again, hip hip hurray.</span></div>

<span>The week commencing the 28<sup>th</sup>
November was full of action for me on the work front, the most important day
being Thursday 1<sup>st</sup>, Yoigo’s fifth anniversary.  We celebrated it with the staff and here is a
great picture of us all with our hands in the air symbolizing Yoigo’s five
incredible years making a bigger and bigger niche for itself in the Spanish
market as a low cost mobile operator.  I really
hope the next 5 years are just as successful and as much fun as the last.</span></div>

<span>The same day as the anniversary I had an
appointment with the urologist for a diagnosis after all the ghastly tests I
have had to go through in the last few weeks. 
The doctor was young and unsympathetic. 
He prescribed me a new medicine called Toviaz 8mg and said it had an  80% success rate but I wouldn’t notice any
improvement until after 6 weeks of taking the very expensive tablet (76 euros a
box!).  I was very disappointed there was
no better cure and had absolutely no faith whatsoever in the new medication
which I started on 2<sup>nd</sup> December. 
That was 8 days ago and actually I am already beginning to notice a
minor improvement.  I am determined to
try it for at least 3 months and then decide whether it really works.  Meanwhile the nights are getting better, you
will be glad to read.</span></div>

<span>The 1<sup>st</sup> of December was good and
bad, like the curate’s egg.  Most
important for me that day though was Olivia on the television, which of course
I missed.  Thankfully I can see her live
reports later on the programme website, La Mañana de la 1.  This time she was reporting on an initiative
by a washing machine manufacturer called Beko who had the great idea of
building a fake gigantic washing machine in the centre of Madrid for people to
donate clothes for Africa. You can see her report <a href="http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/la-manana-de-la-1/manana-1-29-11-11/1261227/">here at minute 12.20</a>.  </span><br></br>

<span>I missed her again on Monday last (5<sup>th</sup>
December) when she reported on a gruesome homicide case when a schizophrenic
son killed his elderly mother who had terminal cancer.  You can see that report <a href="http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/la-manana-de-la-1/manana-1-05-12-11/1266328/">on this link</a> at

<span>Friday, 2<sup>nd</sup> December was much better
and a good end to the week.  I went
shopping with Eladio to Carrefour in Centro Oeste and we tried the “scan and
go” technique for the first time.  I was
curious to see that the devices are made by Motorola, the first
telecommunications company I worked for. 
It worked ok until we got to the till and here it turned out that our
heaving trolley had to be inspected before we could pay and go.  We tried again this week and this time the
whole trolley had to be inspected just because one item had not been scanned
properly.  Frankly we will not be
bothering again until the system works better.  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>On Friday too we went to the cinema and out to
dinner, as our weekly Friday treat. 
Saturdays and Sundays are more difficult as Olga is away and we cannot
leave my Father alone at home.  We went to
see<a href="http://focusfeatures.com/jane_eyre"> the new Jane Eyre film</a> by Cary Fukunaga who I had never heard of.   Of course you know I am a great Brontë fan,
having lived near Haworth and visited it so often, so I was not going to be
critical.  I have seen many versions of
this wonderful classic by the only Brontë sister, Charlotte, to reach the age
of 40.  But wow, what an imagination
these girls had and how I would have loved to know them.  I loved the film from beginning to end.  It enthralled me and brought me right back to
the Brontë world of gloom, rain, the Yorkshire moors, the strict, cruel and
rigid society, the formal language, large, imposing and dark houses and vintage
costumes, all woven into an amazing story, one that remains a classic and has
fascinated me always. If you are a Brontë fan, go and see it, you won’t be
disappointed.  <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8J6Cjn06kA">Here</a>, by the way, is the trailer to whet your appetite.</span><br></br>

<span>Dinner afterwards was at La Alpargatería as
usual and here we enjoyed a meal at our table but annoyingly not at table 7, as we hadn't booked in advance.  Afterwards I made the difficult decision of
not going to Hagen Dazs for one of their delicious ice creams.</span><br></br>

<span>Saturday was spent at home and was very
quiet.  Of note that day Mario, my
nephew and Eladio’s sister, Pili’s son,  turned 21.  Imagine! 
When he was a little boy he was known as “the little terrorist”.  Today he is a groomed, quiet and charming
young man.  Gone are the days when he
would wreck my parents-in-law’s curtains or groan to his Mother constantly.</span></div>

<span>Last Sunday was a highlight in the recounting
of this week’s blog post.  First we had a
bit of an emergency with my Father’s bed sore which had taken a turn for the
worse.  Luckily the Samur (Madrid
emergency medical service) came to take care of it but we did have a bit of a
scare. Up till then we were changing the bandage ourselves every two days but
after last Sunday, the local nurse now comes and it has got much better ever
since.  Carmen the nurse also calls my
Father “Charlés” but is very efficient.</span></div>

<span>That day we were having visitors for lunch and
we were to be 12 around the table.  Pili
and Andrés had come to stay with Paula their daughter who now lives and studies
in Madrid with her cousin and our god daughter, Alicia.  They were all coming for lunch and we would be joined by Toño and Dolores and little Nuba; a nice canine visitor for Elsa and Norah.   </span><br></br>

<span>Whilst we were having a siesta and going for a
walk with the dogs, Spain was playing Argentina in the<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/16024500.stm"> Davis Cup final</a>.  We were able to watch the exciting end of the
match between Spain’s beloved Rafa Nadal and Argentina’s tough opponent Del
Potro.  To our joy and relief Nadal won
not just the match but the whole championship. 
Thus Spain has now garnered 5 Davis Cups, four of them in the last five
years.  Well done Spain and what a great
sporting country it has turned into. 
That was not the case when I first started living in Spain when it was
hardly on the sports’ map.  Today Spain
excels in cycling, Formula 1, motor cycling, tennis, football, basketball and
brings a lot of joy to a country whose sporting victories are often seen as an
antidote to its deep financial crisis. </span><br></br>

<span>The next day was Monday 5<sup>th</sup> and the
beginning of a semi holiday week. In Spain the 6<sup>th</sup> December is a
national holiday to celebrate the Spanish constitution and the 8<sup>th</sup>
is also a holiday to commemorate the Immaculate Conception.  Thus Tuesday and Thursday were “days off” and
many people will have chosen to take the whole week off, adding three days of
their official holiday days, or maybe just the Monday or the Friday, thus enjoying
what people call here a “Puente” or bridge. 
I chose to work most of the week taking time off now and then.  Suzy chose to take the whole week off as Gaby
her boyfriend was obliged to take two weeks of his annual holiday in
November.  They went off on Monday to our
apartment in Santa Pola near Alicante and we have not heard much from them
since they left.  As I write, today
Saturday 10<sup>th</sup>, they are on their way home and we are expecting them
any minute.  I know they had good weather
as there seemed to be sun and temperatures of up to 21ºc every day.  I have also seen some pictures of the food
Gaby cooked for them.  He is rather a
good cook which is very fortunate for Suzy. 
In this photo, Suzy is enjoying a dish he made called “fabes con
almejas” (big white beans with clams).</span><br></br>

<span>On Monday while Susana was on her way to Santa
Pola, I went to the chiropodist and then to the hairdresser for a haircut and
my Father went to the hospital for a check-up with Olga who is his constant
companion.  In the afternoon we met up
with Pili, Andrés and Paula and Oli joined us as did Pedro, Paula’s boyfriend.  We met in Callao, the centre of Madrid which
was a bit of a mistake as it was far too crowded.  The women wanted to shop for clothes in Zara
and HM and we bored the men stiff of course, so we had to abandon our retail
therapy until the next day when we would meet again at La Vaguada shopping
centre.  Eladio took the opportunity to
buy some more Christmas lottery tickets for what is called “El Gordo” in Spain
and which is probably gives the biggest lottery prize money in the world. He did so
in one of Madrid’s most famous streets, Alcalá and I caught the moment on my
camera.</span><br></br>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>Later we were joined by José Antonio and
Dolores and we had a great meal together in the centre of town.</span><br></br>
</div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>Tuesday was the first of the two holidays in
the week and we had agreed to meet up with Pili, Andrés, Paula and Alicia at La
Vaguada, where this time we were able to enjoy our retail therapy whilst the
men had a glass of beer and a cup of coffee in one of the numerous bars in this
gigantic shopping centre.  Shopping is
fun but can be tiring as you can see in the 
photo illustrating this week’s blog.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span><br></br></span><span>In the picture I am holding a wonderful dress
I bought in Zara.  It is a size M tight
figure hugging black sequined evening dress with a low back and elbow length
sleeves which is very slightly too tight for me.  Yet I adore it and Pili, Paula and Oli urged
me to buy it when they saw it on me.  I will be wearing it on New Year's Eve, that is if I don't put on too much weight around Christmas.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>Later we all had lunch together.  Guess where? 
La Alpargatería of course.  We
were joined again by Paula’s beau, Pedro. 
They make such a lovely couple and radiate love just by looking at
them.  I should mention here, that Andrés
treated us, and not only because he is a great fan of this blog but because
it’s worth a mention.  !Gracias Andrés!</span><br></br>

<span>Pili and Andrés were returning to León later
that afternoon, so soon we were to part. 
It was great spending so much time with them.  After their visit, life was pretty quiet and
there is not much to report about the rest of this week really.  We went on our walks, my Father went to his
physiotherapy sessions, Oli went to her TV programme and I worked on and off
most of the week.  And suddenly the week
came to an end and it was Friday again and Eladio and I did the enormous weekly
shopping at Carrefour where we had the bad experience I mentioned earlier with
the “scan and go” system.  In the
evening, for our weekly Friday treat, we skipped on the cinema as there was
no new film that caught our fancy.  We
did however go out to dinner, but not, I am sure you are happy to read, to La
Alpargatería.  No, we went to De Brasa y
Puchero in nearby Boadilla where we had the most scrumptious meal in a long
time.  Want to know what we had? Feeling
hungry?  Well we had “patatas revolconas”
(sort of potato bubble and squeak but with paprika) and fried artichokes for
starters.  My second course was a sort of
bomb as I chose to eat Fabada (Asturian bean dish) as I am a sucker for Spanish
pulses.  Eladio, being the moderate guy
he is, chose fish.  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>As I am on the topic of restaurants, very soon
we will be trying an English one in nearby Pozuelo, recommended to us by Rocío
and her parents.  For an English restaurant it is very fittingly called <a href="http://www.laperfidaalbion.com/">La Pérfida Albión</a> (in English: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfidious_Albion">Perfidious Albion</a>), a term which took me right
back to my history books during the period of the Napoleonic Wars but
apparently its origin is far older if you read the entry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfidious_Albion">here in Wikipedia</a>.  In Wikipedia it says Albión
comes from the Greek for England.  When I
told my philosopher husband, he corrected Wikipedia and told me Albion was
Latin for white and referred probably to the white cliffs of Dover and thus
England.  My Father tended to agree.  Perfidious, of course, means a lack of faith
and I am not getting into a discussion here about England having faith or not
having faith.  The name reminded me too
of my history lessons with my favourite teacher Miss. Scorer at St. Joseph’s
College from whom I learned and will never forget that Napoleon called England
a “nation of shopkeepers”.  Be that as it
may, I look forward to tasting the restaurant’s fish and chips and I am tied
between the Eton Mess and Autumn crumble on their dessert menu.  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>As I am writing this, it is half past eight and
time for our dinner and I’m hungry again. 
But no worries, as I have a wonderful broth (sopa de cocido) waiting for
me to have with some of my home made ham croquettes with Eladio and my Father.  So, on that gastronomic note I will leave you
until next week.  Ah but before I go I
must mention that tonight is the “clásico” or derby between Real Madrid and
Barcelona which my Father and Eladio will be watching with great interest.  I am less interested in the play and more
interested in the result, so will probably be uploading this blog whilst they
are enjoying the two teams playing in the Bernabeu stadium this foggy rainy
night in November.  </span><br></br>
<span>  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>Tomorrow Christmas will be coming
to this house as it’s time to put up our tree and all the Christmassy things I
have collected over the years to decorate the house and bring in some of the
season’s magic.  I have only begun to prepare for Christmas but the main ingredients are on their way with crackers from <a href="http://www.christmascrackershop.com/">The Christmas Cracker shop </a>and Christmas pudding, cranberry sauce and chocolates  from <a href="http://www.britishcornershop.co.uk/">The British Corner Shop</a>.  I could get neither from Marks and Spencers online or Amazon.co.uk because neither will send crackers abroad as they are now considered fireworks!  M+S won't send food abroad and it was very difficult to chocolates from Amazon too.  So let's hope my orders from the two newly discovered online sources will arrive ok.</span><br></br>
<span><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>And that is it my friends for this
edition.  I wish you all a great
week.  I will have a busy one, I’m
sure.  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>Until next week, take care.</span></div>
