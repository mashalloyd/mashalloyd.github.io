Olivia, my youngest daughter,&nbsp; and I had been so looking forward to it and it certainly met our expectations. New York is big, it's brash, very expensive, confusing, dirty, both poor and obscenely rich, one of the biggest shopping meccas I have ever seen, mind boggling and overwhelming at times. It's full&nbsp; of people from all over&nbsp; the world,&nbsp; a true melting pot and many, many of them speak Spanish. All the skyscrapers make you feel so small and Madrid is like a village in comparison Honestly, I don't think I could ever live there as I am more of a country girl but New York is always fun and fun we had as you will read on.</div><div><br /></div><div>So let me tell you the stories of the second half of our stay there. I left off&nbsp;<b>last Sunday</b>. Sadly, that day, we had to check out of our amazing 159m2 suite at <a href="https://www.rosewoodhotels.com/en/the-carlyle-new-york?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=sem&amp;utm_campaign=acr-rwcdb-pmax-conv-prosp&amp;utm_content=suitesojourn&amp;utm_term=na&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAlsy5BhDeARIsABRc6ZtsiAMnBGKjXYuveJzln3dtyunpRsvL3ppOIYuj95BZMKiPzBiSb3EaAp-bEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">The Carlyle</a> where we had been invited by the President of Rosewood Hotels himself and learned how the other half live for two glorious nights. I later found out that the price per night was around 6.500 dollars!!!&nbsp; We were moving to <a href="https://www.editionhotels.com/times-square/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAlsy5BhDeARIsABRc6Zs8rBBaim894k3UYqEn-cFJHWp5gK3u-BHdOXxEMVQu5kj0WpbgVDsaAgMaEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">The Times Square Edition</a>, another 5 star hotel but not in the same league. That's where Illy, the Italian coffee company had booked a room for the other 3 nights for Olivia who was to be their MC for the Ernesto Illy International Award Ceremony on Tuesday in New York. We downsized but moved nearer to the centre.</div><div><br /></div><div>Before checking out at noon, we took a stroll in Central Park and had a quick glimpse of the famous "Met" (Metropolitan Museum), both very near our hotel. We did not go inside as it would have taken a whole morning and we were only in the Big Apple for 5 nights. No worries, as I saw it last time I was in NY and, no doubt, Oli will return one day.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>We saw Central Park in Autumn, or in the Fall as the Americans say,&nbsp; It is New York's version of Hyde Park and similar in many senses. It's full mostly of locals either running, strolling, cycling or chatting and eating and enjoying the scenery. Last time I was there, Eladio and I did the classic horse and carriage ride but Oli thought that was too cheesy. So we just walked and feasted our eyes on what we saw.&nbsp;</div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgWcAKNO-yUhfyP3YHD73j_cCdavNe6JuB27SFf6yq-ktCZ7lLoeGIZwyyrXWSf79j7qiF4ZwqmY-01XOUvEio1lixTXHApzQKDJKelXxgY_1vgWI88V67Vb-QH1Pm_se8V8QTALoC5-x2kuXA7eLGwPqyKIZrsoOJXSd1IyesAZgdtyT_eTbTFQ/s4032/20241110_102405.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1816" data-original-width="4032" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgWcAKNO-yUhfyP3YHD73j_cCdavNe6JuB27SFf6yq-ktCZ7lLoeGIZwyyrXWSf79j7qiF4ZwqmY-01XOUvEio1lixTXHApzQKDJKelXxgY_1vgWI88V67Vb-QH1Pm_se8V8QTALoC5-x2kuXA7eLGwPqyKIZrsoOJXSd1IyesAZgdtyT_eTbTFQ/w400-h180/20241110_102405.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>In Central Park last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We were well wrapped up but actually we had very good weather during our whole stay. It hardly ever rained and was never very cold. Thus we had the perfect weather to do all the classic things one does when in New York. I was keen to show Oli "Strawberry Fields", the memorial to John Lennon who was killed in 1980 in the archway of his house, Dakota, where I think his wife, Yoko Ono, still lives. Many had the same idea and I just had to include a photo here of two Trump supporters of whom we saw more than we imagined. We saw lots of MAGA (Make America Great Again) memorabilia. It's funny but it's not.<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidk2at3yQZb_p5Jjgw_g7DKMYY_-UKDvyyXqTvHPopZjEj17A6Rqs2IiAC6jG8al2HZSBMut-TlTyC0D9tq206JwAIf9emAZZSA4XjnNY0-ivmPQqmptuAh9jptlKJXCHo-c4S4jnNOnGU2F_70HiGTkiwBQqMtxn58CKW72K7P_RjQfTeJYjk6Q/s1600/IMG-20241110-WA0022.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1490" data-original-width="1600" height="373" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidk2at3yQZb_p5Jjgw_g7DKMYY_-UKDvyyXqTvHPopZjEj17A6Rqs2IiAC6jG8al2HZSBMut-TlTyC0D9tq206JwAIf9emAZZSA4XjnNY0-ivmPQqmptuAh9jptlKJXCHo-c4S4jnNOnGU2F_70HiGTkiwBQqMtxn58CKW72K7P_RjQfTeJYjk6Q/w400-h373/IMG-20241110-WA0022.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjDyN4wiVjKyRn39Mwv3PDq12Zwz7Oc4OJNj8WyWJncOO37_uSUB6ZwLBhJJdGMCARxbOVHzAVrT1y0ozRUx2XaWjxYINPfop_6XQ58wuCavt1gtNj1fpY6q8YXEgQHWevwL-p5IBexY_ngh-jepRblhLMQuWfy_QyC97QB1rPWX-FSrwxvGiStTQ/s2000/IMG-20241110-WA0044.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1500" data-original-width="2000" height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjDyN4wiVjKyRn39Mwv3PDq12Zwz7Oc4OJNj8WyWJncOO37_uSUB6ZwLBhJJdGMCARxbOVHzAVrT1y0ozRUx2XaWjxYINPfop_6XQ58wuCavt1gtNj1fpY6q8YXEgQHWevwL-p5IBexY_ngh-jepRblhLMQuWfy_QyC97QB1rPWX-FSrwxvGiStTQ/w400-h300/IMG-20241110-WA0044.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>At the John Lennon memorial in Central Park</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Someone was playing and singing Beatles' songs and it was an emotional moment.

Reception was on the 10th floor and we were given a room on the 35th! It was nice but 23m2 compared to 159m2 is pure downsizing and downgrading. However, it was also free and beggars can't be choosers and we very happy to be there.&nbsp;<div><br /><div>As soon as we had settled in, we went out into the street to explore Times Square which I had seen before but was new for Olivia. It's like Piccadilly but much bigger and brasher. I had always heard there was a naked cowboy there but never saw him last time so I was stunned to find him. I was also stunned he let me have a photo taken of him with a security guard from Times Square. That just has to be this week's feature photo. I later learned that apart from a street performer, he is also a singer, songwriter and occasional actor. When I asked him why he goes round Times Square naked (apart from some underpants with the American flag on them), he replied because he was born naked. I couldn't argue with that and was delighted to have met him.</div><div><br /></div><div>We took more photos to remember this trip which will be forever etched in our minds.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQx6tgcC438TI81pBGnYwv5eCfd7t3ryHZfW9QqfKW3w4BpFz2V8dJx8c0gFhN_q0ZPM5mL7Xvpo2wZ8YmubMw3UQJwlHvA7vCDnJZpW4ldU_-aHvUsLm4DHOXUkTdoDXQjgWPkqQK8O_8TkNWyWd5ZZfMeHkq3aBV0TtKknF_IjW_PO9adqTDdw/s3326/20241110_134834.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="3326" data-original-width="1816" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQx6tgcC438TI81pBGnYwv5eCfd7t3ryHZfW9QqfKW3w4BpFz2V8dJx8c0gFhN_q0ZPM5mL7Xvpo2wZ8YmubMw3UQJwlHvA7vCDnJZpW4ldU_-aHvUsLm4DHOXUkTdoDXQjgWPkqQK8O_8TkNWyWd5ZZfMeHkq3aBV0TtKknF_IjW_PO9adqTDdw/w219-h400/20241110_134834.jpg" width="219" /></a></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2RuVKhjRxNSUmTtC-CExX4jJoclOyqPx6sY24hxQyGun-AFxRhhTEZ3xTYTCC-si4bIkZgH0tKQlUxMIZVK0b-ASPFa2IhZAI1B7DBt4GVkxvXOxSQBzdLugm3s7T1F9LLBRfj1wkCTe3483SS70Q0g3dffoy_IopbI_xZwPgmonImMlR433dvg/s4032/20241110_135012.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1816" data-original-width="4032" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2RuVKhjRxNSUmTtC-CExX4jJoclOyqPx6sY24hxQyGun-AFxRhhTEZ3xTYTCC-si4bIkZgH0tKQlUxMIZVK0b-ASPFa2IhZAI1B7DBt4GVkxvXOxSQBzdLugm3s7T1F9LLBRfj1wkCTe3483SS70Q0g3dffoy_IopbI_xZwPgmonImMlR433dvg/w400-h180/20241110_135012.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Times Square on Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div>We then went tacky souvenir shopping as Oli wanted to buy magnets, mugs, etc for friends. I couldn't believe the prices. We then went into the huge M&amp;Ms store with the pretext of buying sweets for the children but we ended up getting all sorts for ourselves as well. What a wonderful store it is, even if it is tacky and such a commercial mecca.</div><div><br /></div><div>Even though we had had a marvelous breakfast at The Carlyle, by about 3.30 we were hungry and went in search of food which we found at a Burger joint, called Burger Man, which was actually very good. It looked like something out of a film, a typical American diner. There are many places and things which seem familiar from all the US films and series we see on TV which is another reason why New York is so fascinating.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Before returning to our hotel, Oli had a craving for an ice cream which we ate in the street and then, tired out and still a big jet lagged we returned to our new abode. There we spent the whole afternoon resting. We watched a marvelous film called Still Alice which we loved and a bit of one called Safe which we didn't. We must have fallen asleep around 8.30 pm and were awake at 5 am on Monday morning.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Monday</b>, 11th November was Armistice Day which is called Veterans' Day in the US. We saw plenty of military around but missed the 5th Avenue parade.&nbsp; But we saw some preparations on our way to the Empire State Building where we had booked tickets online.

It is no longer the tallest skyscraper but it is still perhaps the most famous. I learned that the far smaller Tower Building was arguably the first skyscraper to be built in the city in 1889.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>As I went up in the lift to the 80 something floor, I wondered what immigrants fleeing poor countries, wars and famine, must have thought of New York when they arrived. If it's overwhelming to me in 2024 what would it have been like for immigrants and refugees I wondered to myself. I suppose that is the essence of the American Dream. They all arrived at Ellis Island, that tiny island with the famous Statue of Liberty which we only saw from a distance. It is sad to think now that while they were all welcome at the beginning of the last century, today it is the other way round; walls are built to keep them out. Yet, America would not be America without immigrants would it? But I am digressing. The views from the top are amazing and we were lucky we had good visibility.

You probably all know that my best friend, Fátima, who was my colleague first at Motorola, then at Nokia and also my neighbour, died sadly 5 years ago this year. Her daughter, also Fátima, was 19 at the time and was left an orphan. Her mother had asked me and all her friends to watch out for her daughter and take care of her as well as we could but she is very independent and really never needed us. It was only through Gloria, Fátima's sister, that I learned Fatima junior was living in New York so we quickly organised a meetup before we left.&nbsp; It was to be the cherry on the cake of our 5 days in New York.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>We walked to the MOMA (Museum of Modern Art) and spent about 2h inside which is more than enough. I was deadbeat when we came out. I adored the Picassos, the Monets, the Magrittes, the Matisses, the Andy Warhols and the Van Goghs but&nbsp; was disappointed that Starry Skies was not on display. But I was not too impressed with the abstract art which I have never understood. There was one painting that was just grey and black. What the hell does that mean?

I sat and waited as honestly I didn't need to make any purchases. From the MOMA, we were take the subway to 26th Street but got lost in translation as the station we needed on 53rd street was closed. We made it the TVE studio half an hour late but we made it. Oli and Sara (Rancaño) were happy to reconnect as both of them had worked for España Directo. Sara showed us the premises and even the rooftop from where she makes most of her reports. She actually has to stand on a small ladder so that the skyscrapers behind her stand out enough.&nbsp; I took a photo of the two RTVE journalists in that very place.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVR-vJzN1TyK70plrpYlfGFBR-XP4z0fVw8vYO7FzkFxyAwOx4yxz30gZja7hxUWSk-uT08WnkQKuyS_xFxPZttL57ybGFiqijMUeWeW50so3b4bjqFNyi9T43CaoPBaSbMDG9tx85PlgYeAI_DpGboq9W1vmaqyRo1-Q1T1ZmL46ePqGTPHmjBw/s1600/IMG-20241113-WA0024.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1200" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVR-vJzN1TyK70plrpYlfGFBR-XP4z0fVw8vYO7FzkFxyAwOx4yxz30gZja7hxUWSk-uT08WnkQKuyS_xFxPZttL57ybGFiqijMUeWeW50so3b4bjqFNyi9T43CaoPBaSbMDG9tx85PlgYeAI_DpGboq9W1vmaqyRo1-Q1T1ZmL46ePqGTPHmjBw/w300-h400/IMG-20241113-WA0024.jpg" width="300" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Oli with her former colleague Sara (R) from TVE, now their correspondent in NY</i></td></tr></tbody></table>It was interesting to listen to her experiences covering the Presidential election campaign as well as the behind the scenes life of a foreign correspondent.&nbsp;<br /><div><br /><div>We left on time to meet Fátima junior at 4 pm and had decided on Le Pain Quotidien near Bryant Park. That was where we had our lunch; lentils and a cake for me. It was pure joy to see Fatimina as we call her, now 24 and a graduate of international relations.&nbsp; She studied at the UEM near here but also in Grenobles and Los Angeles. Today she is living in New York and working for <a href="https://www.globalfundforwidows.org/">Global Fund for Widows</a>, the world's largest nonprofit organisation dedicated to empowering women and widows financially. <a href="https://www.globalfundforwidows.org/team/fatima-martin-sanchez" target="_blank">Fatimina's CV</a> at just 24 is impressive.&nbsp; Her boss, <a href="https://enterprise.news/egypt/en/news/story/af3cc279-45ea-4ed8-9c50-9d5c3cbd626e/heather-ibrahim-leathers,-president,-founder-and-chair-of-the-global-fund-for-widows">Heather Ibrahim Leathers</a>, of Egyptian origin and ex Wall Street, founded it and was a nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize. Much of <span style="color: black;">Fátima's work</span>&nbsp;has to do with the United Nations where she goes often. I later read that&nbsp; her NGO, "h<span style="font-size: 17px;"><span><span>aving earned United Nations Economic and Social Council accreditation (</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 17px;">ECOSOC)&nbsp; &nbsp;has been advocating widows' rights on a global scale.

They are also frequently subjected to harmful traditional practices".&nbsp;</span></div><!--/data/user/0/com.samsung.android.app.notes/files/clipdata/clipdata_bodytext_241115_182240_608.sdocx--><div><br /></div><div>As she was telling us all this, I could only think just how proud her mother would be. It was a very joyous reunion and it was great to catch up after so much time. Fátima junior, if you read this, I take my hat off to you. Well done sweetheart.

We also walked into a drug store to get a sandwich for my flight as the food is awful on Air Europa. Olivia, travelling in Business Class would be well fed, hahaha.</div><div><br /></div><div>Soon the Cadillac, a brand new version I had never seen, pulled up on 42nd Street. The "greeter", a lovely Indian lady from the Punjab, drove us to T4 at JFK airport, the biggest. We were there on time or so we thought but hadn't factored in just how long the security queues would be and at one point I thought we might miss our plane. Thankfully we didn't and it left on time. The plane was half full and I was lucky there was no one sitting next to me which meant that I could stretch out on three seats. That way I got at least 4h sleep. We left at 10.30 NY time which was 04.30 Spanish time and landed in Madrid at 11.30 local time. I got off the plane feeling like a zombie and dying to be home and to have a shower. I was at our house by 12.30 after dropping Oli off. And there was my faithful husband waiting for me at the gate to carry my luggage and there were Suzy and Pippa to greet me too, as well as Tana. The Carlyle might be fantastic but there is no place like home. I couldn't face lunch so unpacked, gave&nbsp; my presents to Suzy, had a shower and went straight to bed. I slept for 2.5h and woke up at 5ish feeling jet lagged. I could face dinner but not wine. I was bushed.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I managed a reasonable night's sleep but was woken by a beep from my Airbnb app at 1.30. It was someone wanting to check in the next day (Friday)&nbsp; for a couple of nights. Only when I read the message did I realise that I knew the guest, Lola (Z)&nbsp; from Nokia Málaga, a long lost colleague.&nbsp; I knew her very well but hadn't seen her for more than 20 years! She now lives in London and is married to&nbsp; a Brit. It turns out her sister lives in the next street to ours and she was coming to a big family do and needed somewhere to stay rather than sleep on a sofa. What a small world we live in. Amazing.</div><div><br /></div><div>I woke up on <b>Friday morning</b> at 07.30 to carry on texting with Lola. She asked if I wanted anything from England and I asked for a mint chocolate Aero bar (divine). Eladio and I did the shopping that morning and Tana, bless her, met and greeted two other guests coming (Leonardo from Brazil and Raúl who I think is Spanish). We came home with enough food to feed an army. That's what I always think and then it only ever lasts a week. We had a pleasant lunch with Suzy who I had missed while in the US, of course.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>It was on Friday that I finally caught up with the news this week.&nbsp; Anything we watched on American telly seemed to be only about Trump and the people he is nominating for government. That includes Elon Musk (X - Twitter) as his Chief Efficiency Officer (imagine). When they weren't talking about Trump there were adverts and they seemed to be mostly about health insurance. God save America if Trump does away with Obama Care. And when I read the news from England about the resignation of Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury over his handling of sex abuse in the church, the Church of England, I was appalled. In Spain, more floods hit Valencia and then Malaga and other areas but thankfully this time people were alerted by SMS and no lives were lost. But these "Dana" storms are getting worse and worse each year.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>That night Eladio and I were up late watching a new Spanish period series called "Valle Salvaje" which had us hooked. Thus I woke up late on <b>Saturday morning&nbsp;</b> and Lola who had arrived the night before, was already in the kitchen. We spent a good 2 hours together catching up and later Suzy joined us. That's because when she was in London they met. Isn't the world a small place? Suzy took a photo of the two of us which I entitled "Nokia connecting colleagues". Here we are together, happy to be reunited by Airbnb 20 years on. What a beautiful surprise and coincidence.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFvqSvs4VzRVDTH6jDClB_JsNVioLiKtULirJFJQbHRB1Wt1GKZ06KbhP60N6MAIqLx22ye9Um1uMeKDEWqcpSYhInyr0atalIE7zbEGgPPjkdbWvlh48sUzg1hy4c-rivfeHqtJk_4Vx8C3c-O7VtJYf04Z8qDNcp_ZH_OhRRt1FZsFjLPTp6qA/s4032/20241116_094923.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1816" data-original-width="4032" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFvqSvs4VzRVDTH6jDClB_JsNVioLiKtULirJFJQbHRB1Wt1GKZ06KbhP60N6MAIqLx22ye9Um1uMeKDEWqcpSYhInyr0atalIE7zbEGgPPjkdbWvlh48sUzg1hy4c-rivfeHqtJk_4Vx8C3c-O7VtJYf04Z8qDNcp_ZH_OhRRt1FZsFjLPTp6qA/w400-h180/20241116_094923.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>With Lola, my surprise Airbnb guest who was my colleague at Nokia and who I hadn't seen for 20 odd years.

Oli and co were coming and I was making Spanish "cocido madrileño". Before going out to get some ingredients I needed for lunch and to have coffee with Eladio, I went up to Suzy's room to ask her to watch the hob. And there she was with little Pippa who is with her always. They are very close and I think Suzy is more her person now than me. That only makes me happy. The thing is that Pippa makes us all happy.

The estimates for making it habitable were prohibitive as well as the cost of the town council licence, not to mention furnishing it.&nbsp; We goth agreed that had we been 10 or 20 years younger, it may have been a good idea but not now. So that's the end of one chapter. Others will come.<br /><div><br /></div><div>We were home on time for me to make the finishing touches for the family lunch and Oli and family arrived just as everything was ready to serve. It was great to see my grandchildren again and to hold them in my arms. I had bought lots of bubble gum (gob stoppers) for Elliot from FAO Schwartz but it was not easy to show him how to make the bubbles.
