<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Hello
everyone.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Today is
Easter day and the sun is shining as it has done now for what seems like weeks.  We had glorious weather in Santa Pola last
week, as we did at home afterwards and in Montrondo too which made for a lovely
time with the family as Montrondo is always more enjoyable with good weather. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I last wrote
on Monday 30<sup>th</sup> March, a very warm day, part of which I spent on the terrace
by the still covered swimming pool.  I
took a photo of little Pippa who is now 4 months old and you can see just how
much she has grown.  When she came she
was 2.5 months old and weighed 2.2kg. 
She now weighs nearly 3 kgs but will not grow to be much more than 4 or
4.5kg.  She is such a darling.  I spoke to Antonio Cheara, her breeder from
Granada last week and when I told him what a beautifully behaved puppy she is
he told me that that was because when he breeds his dogs one of the main tasks
is to make sure the puppies are of good character and well balanced.  I must say he has done his job right. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">On Tuesday I
had lunch in Madrid with a journalist I have known for many years; Pilar.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We spoke shop of course but also talked a lot
about the sector.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The weather was so
good we ate on the terrace outside of a very well-known restaurant in Madrid
which neither of us had ever been to but came well recommended.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><a href="http://www.elparaguas.com/" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">El Paraguas </a><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">offers mostly Asturian food which
I adore.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We saw two very famous Spanish business
men at one of the tables, Joan Rosell, the head of the CEOE (Spanish employers’
association) together with Arturo Fernández the VP of the CEOE who became even
more famous recently for using one of the so-called “black” credit cards when
he was on the Board of Directors of Bankia (Spanish bank).</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The cards used by the board members have
caused a huge scandal in Spain when we learned that users had more or less carte
blanche to spend them as they wanted.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Arturo Fernández explained to the press that he used his card at his own
chain or restaurants which was a total farse. As I went passed their table I
felt like asking them what card they would be using to pay for their lunch
which no doubt will come from tax payers’ money.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Tuesday was
busy for me as I had to squeeze many tasks into my day, quite a bit of work,
the trip to Madrid and back for the lunch with the journalist, shopping to buy
food for Montrondo and to leave at home, as well as our hour long daily walk
with the dogs which is a must in our life. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Tuesday,
just on time for Easter, as we were leaving the next day, my Bettys Easter
order arrived.  <a href="http://www.bettys.co.uk/">Bettys</a> is a lovely small Yorkshire
chain of first class, quaint and exquisite café tea rooms.  Today you can order some of their wonderful
produce online to be shipped abroad.  I
had ordered this Easter hamper.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Wednesday I
was up at 7 as we were to leave for Montrondo at about 10.30 and there was lots
to do before we could hit the road.  It was
on the way in the car when I got a message from my lifelong friend Amanda that
her Mother, Mrs. Leonard (Sheila), aged 88 had died the night before quite
suddenly in the nursing home she had just moved to near her son Simon’s house
in Yorkshire.  She accompanied this photo
which I want to publish here in tribute to Mrs. Leonard, a lovely genteel,
correct but sometimes fun loving quiet, kind woman with a twinkle in her
eye.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

</tbody></table>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">For me Mrs.
Leonard was a reference in my childhood being the Mother of my best
friend.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">She of course was English,
unlike my bohemian Russian Mother and ran her house like clockwork. </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Naturally I loved my parents and our home but
I often envied Amanda and Simon’s real English home which was clean, tidy and organized
with meals at fixed hours.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Amanda’s
parents had a social life, unlike my parents, had a car and went out for dinner
often. They even went on package holidays when they came into fashion.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Whereas in our house, there was no car, we
went everywhere by bus and meals were mostly cooked by my Father who hadn’t a clue
how to cook.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">My Mother only cooked when
she felt like it.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">As to going out to
dinner that was never on their agenda nor were package holidays.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We either went everywhere by train or bus or
in my Aunty Masha’s old cars in gypsy like travels across Europe. As my
parents, much to my chagrin, never had a car. it was Amanda’s Father, Bob, Mr.
Leonard to me, who would drive us everywhere.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">He was a very special man too with a great sense of humour and my
parents and I always enjoyed it when he came to pick me up or drop me off at
home and lingered in our hall chatting to us. Amanda and I were an odd couple
at school but fast friends.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I say we
were odd because she came from the perfect English home, was very studious (she
went on to study at Oxford) and above all was thin.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I came from a multicultural, Bohemian, untidy
and disorganized home, was not a good student and worst of all I was fat.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We used to look at ourselves in the mirror at
school (St. Joseph’s College) and say we were Laurel and Hardy.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Once on one of Amanda’s school reports a
teacher wrote about her: “good when not sitting next to Masha”.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I was mortified.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">But despite my bad reputation at school Mrs.
Leonard loved me and put up with my imperfections.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I must have been 15 and was smoking as most
of us did at the time and I clearly remember dear Mrs. Leonard enjoying a cigarette
or two with me which I found a pleasure and will never forget. So when I got
the news from Amanda on the way to Montrondo on Wednesday I was shocked and
cried together with my friend.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I do hope
she gets the chance to talk to my bohemian Mother up there and both of them
have a laugh and remember us when we were children and teenagers.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I remember when we were children that my
Mother and Mrs. Leonard went shopping together to the butcher for my Mother to
buy the roast beef I used to enjoy at their house and that my Mother gave Mrs.
Leonard her rice recipe which Amanda loved and which Mrs. Leonard wanted to
make for her daughter as she was worried about her being so thin. This is my
tribute to Sheila Leonard who for me will always be Mrs. Leonard, the mother of
my best friend and part of my childhood; her death marks the end of an era for
me.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">R.I.P. Mrs. Leonard.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Shortly after
the sad news we stopped at Rueda for our traditional glass of wine and plate of
ham at Palacio de Bornos which cheered me up enormously.  Pippa stayed in the car meanwhile in her beautiful
dog transporter and didn’t complain. Afterwards she got a small walk as
compensation. Here is a photo of Eladio enjoying the stop at Rueda.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We arrived in
Montrondo just on time for lunch with José Antonio and Dolores and Eladio’s
Mother Ernestina; not that we were at all hungry.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Dolores had made a super meal of chicken and
rice.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Afterwards I went for a long walk
to Senra and back (about 7 or 8km) in the sun with Dolores, my other
sister-in-law Adela and some of the women from the village we know quite well,
Pili, Manolita and Josefa.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Here is a
selfie just when we got to Senra.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It was
to be Pippa’s first walk in Montrondo and she was a little champion.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I mean for her tiny size and tiny legs it
must have been quite a challenge.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">But
she enjoyed it immensely, following Nuba, Dolores’ dog and all the smells and
greenery; not that she can see much from her tiny height.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">She never let me out of sight always coming
back when I called her.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></div>

meanwhile spent the afternoon with the workers at our house which is being
rebuilt.  The truth is there has been
hardly any progress on it since my accident at the end of January; so there was
not much to get excited about. They are obviously working on other projects
where perhaps the owners are putting more pressure on them than on us. In any
case it was good to see the work they had done this week on the back of the
house, making the outside steps and patio using the traditional stone which
must be very heavy to move.  Below is a
photo of how the house looks from the front and the back as well as the steps
and patio.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">As became a

Senra and back in the afternoon.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We were

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">That night for
the first time in the history of our family in Montrondo we all watched a film
together.  It was “La Isla Mínima”
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshland_(film)">Marshland</a>); a Spanish murder thriller set in the 80’s in the south of Spain
(Doñana).  It had won 10 of the 17
Spanish film awards (Goyas) and I was keen to see it. The reason we have never
watched films together before is that there was nowhere comfortable to watch
them and the televisions were old.  Now
we have all the modern comforts in Montrondo, barring internet, which I promise
you will be solved when our house is finished. 
For me internet is as important as water and electricity.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">On Good Friday
we had hot cross buns for breakfast which Suzy’s friend Elena had brought for

in Santa Pola.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">That morning we were

including him.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Alejandro came with his
Paraguyan wife Carolina and that day as we were all together we decided to have
lunch together.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It was to be at Pili’s

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Before lunch,
however, there was an important event taking place in the village hall, a meeting
of the villagers called by the mayoress of the nearby town Murias to which Montrondo
belongs.  I went along with Pippa and
Carolina to see what it was all about even though I knew it was only really the
men from the village who would attend. 
Montrondo is very old fashioned and quite sexist when it comes to men
and women’s place in society.  For
example, in the church the men stand at the back and the women at the
front.  When I posted this photo on
Facebook English women friends of mine asked me where the women were.  It was a good question.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I suppose most
of the women were making the lunch whilst the men were listening, or watching
like me – in my case in amazement – to the mayoress (practically the only woman
there) whom I had never met. She wore long leather boots and a waistcoat, spoke
like a politician and it seemed she was just missing a whip in her hand to lash
out at all of us.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">To me it felt a bit
like a class of naughty children listening to a strict teacher letting off
steam. She talked about the villagers having to collaborate but didn’t give
examples so I didn’t really know what she was referring to and didn’t dare ask –
after all I was a woman and only the wife of a man from the village
hahaha.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It seemed that most of the
meeting was about reelecting the members of the local committee and there
seemed to be division on who should be the secretary.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">However nothing was agreed upon in the
meeting and I never found out what the final decision was.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">You will not be surprised to hear that there
is not one single woman on this committee.</span></div>

where we all contributed with enough food perhaps to feed the whole village, it
was siesta time for most of the family, except me.  Eladio chose to sleep outside in the sun behind

Pippa barked at a mule as well as some of the cows.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I think she had only just noticed them. This
is probably the moment to talk about the animals in Montrondo of which there
are many; but far fewer than when the village was fully populated when Eladio
and his brothers and sisters were children.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Even so, today the cows, hens, horses, donkeys, mules, difficult to see
wolves and bears, as well as storks at this time of year, are part of the way
of living and really a part of the scenery.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">For me, however, they are always a sight for sore eyes, as I am such an
animal lover as you will know by now.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">If
I lived there I would probably have a small farm including a donkey which is
perhaps my favourite animal of all.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Well
you see I am British and was brought up riding on donkeys at the seaside as a
child and have loved them ever since.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In
Spain, donkeys are not a revered animal and no one here understands my love of
them.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I also adore horses but never got
the opportunity to learn to ride them.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">My friend Amanda did of course but my parents thought it was an
expensive hobby and couldn’t see the point of it as neither of them
particularly liked animals.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I remember
asking for a pony or riding lessons and my Mother replying that I would have to
do with a “pony tail”.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">So of course one
of the reasons I love Montrondo is because of its fauna.</span></div>

Alejando, Carolina, Isidro and Yoli left for León where they live reducing our
numbers.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">That evening we were all so

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Saturday
morning our numbers were further reduced when José Antonio and Dolores
left.  We were to leave too that day but
not until after lunch.  Thus Eladio and I
went for the walk to Senra on our own with Pippa.  Again it was a glorious day and we enjoyed
every minute of our last few hours in the countryside.  Here is a photo of Eladio closing the gate
between the fields of Montrondo and the old path to Murias, with Pippa at his
feet as usual.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

Pippa.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">As Pippa hasn’t had much contact

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The photo
illustrating this week’s blog post is of me on the return walk from Senra with
the Montrondo in the backdrop.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">You can
see there is still some snow on the top of the mountains.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">However I didn’t dare go up the mountains
preferring to walk on the relatively flat roads and paths, whilst I am still recovering
from my broken ankle.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I must say I
enjoyed the walks to Senra and back every day immensely; they were the fodder
of my dreams when I was bedridden after the operation and unable to go on walks
for some two months.</span></div>

to the village the bread van from Murias had stopped near our cluster of
houses.  I thought you might be
interested to see how bread is bought in the village as there are no
shops.  Here you can see Pili, my sister-in-law,
buying bread, as well as our neighbor Salo who lives permanently there.  Salo’s grandson and Trébol got in the picture

village about half an hour away from Montrondo, on our way home, to see a vet
called Raquel Dolores had recommended us.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We needed to give Pippa her 4</span><sup style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">th</sup><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> obligatory vaccination (against
rabies) which was to be much cheaper than in Madrid (15 euros vs approximately
60).</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We had to wait a while at the vet’s
place, a sort of rambling animal paradise off the road with views of meadows
and mountains.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Pippa had the run of the place as we waited for Raquel to return from a nearby village. </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> H</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">ere hens live loose and there are cats and dogs of all types all living harmoniously together.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It seemed like paradise to me.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We didn’t get
home till at least 10 last night as apart from it being a long journey (over
400km) there was heavy traffic on the road into Madrid.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Olivia and Miguel had prepared dinner for us
which was a treat: Oli’s first Spanish tortilla, salad and Gema’s home- made
bread.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">But first I had to greet our
other two dogs, Norah the beagle and Elsa the Labrador, who, I have to admit,
are very much out of the limelight since little Pippa arrived.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Suzy was indignant that we had taken her to
Montrondo when we have never taken them.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I feel guilty about that too but of course we don’t yet have our own

Miguel, meanwhile, had a lovely quiet Easter break enjoying the sun, doing
exercise and seeing friends. Yesterday they went to a restaurant for lunch in Los Molinos
in the mountainous area of Madrid (Sierra de Guadarama) called <a href="http://www.elportical.com/">El Portical</a>,
which belongs to a friend of Rocio’s. Here is a photo of the “manada” (the
girls group of friends) at the restaurant. Both of our girls have been there
before and say the place is great with good food and inexpensive prices.  I look forward to going there too one day
with Eladio or taking visitors from abroad. 
Maybe we can take Keith and Lorraine there when they come in May.  Yeah, they are coming to stay which will be a
lot of fun. If you are reading this Lorraine you may want to consider this an option instead of a Parador.  Check out the website.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
