By next Sunday we should be home. Our touring and sightseeing finishes here in Bologna, the food capital of Italy. From here we shall cross the country towards Genova and probably stay a night on the Italian Riviera before heading over to France. The idea is to spend one night probably in Nimes and then drive to Gerona, Spain and from there, home, sweet home.  We've had an amazing time but all good things come to an end, as they usually do.  To quote Eladio this has been a road trip with a special emphasis on Italy. We love Italy but I must say I wish we had stayed just a bit longer in Greece where we only really touched its surface. In order to remember our trip better, I created a map on the My Maps app and this is what it looks like on Google Earth. Pretty cool I think, don't you? Ah, and here is the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1dMv8QN8EnWPDaJAE5667rfd7MNmKKIs&amp;usp=sharing">link</a>. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEioRLQaH-MDJ6BS34BzpQyjZN1F_zb0A_93-JcpvEMjHfGYsai6dT-pksukKfkyXsKQtAHTaU7NUqDBdMSTGnaibt-Z2k5WyYq89zhavGXHYgjdCBkvSOLEaCiM2lEqVu54wJ-By4mlp2fEobSCa2UGt7-DMWHGO5Rrzwg6ajvG1rx_RtI3X4pJQw/s928/map%20until%20Bologna.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="171" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEioRLQaH-MDJ6BS34BzpQyjZN1F_zb0A_93-JcpvEMjHfGYsai6dT-pksukKfkyXsKQtAHTaU7NUqDBdMSTGnaibt-Z2k5WyYq89zhavGXHYgjdCBkvSOLEaCiM2lEqVu54wJ-By4mlp2fEobSCa2UGt7-DMWHGO5Rrzwg6ajvG1rx_RtI3X4pJQw/w400-h171/map%20until%20Bologna.png" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Map of our road trip as far as Bologna, from May 4th to Sunday 23rd June. </i></td></tr></tbody></table>I still haven't worked out the number of kilometres this amounts to but it's definitely around 9.000, less than last year (over 13.000) as we didn't go so far. <br></br><p>I left off <b>last Saturday</b> on our last day there before sailing back to Italy. We were going to spend the whole day at our marvelous accommodation at the Blue Bay Apartments, but decided we should really use the morning to explore the area and  see the famed coastal villages of Syvota and Parga.  I had no idea of their existence until I looked for accommodation near the ferry port in Igoumenitsa. It was Helen, our Airbnb owner in Thessalonika who told me we must visit them. Later I fell in love with the area and only wished we could have stayed longer and gone to some of the Ionian islands, including Corfu. But that couldn't be as I had already bought our ferry tickets to Bari. But one day we shall come back to the Epirus coastline, being compared to the Amalfi Coast in Italy. There are similarities but honestly the Greek counterpart is far less crowded and more laid back. </p><p>We saw enough of this area to want to come back.  As we stepped out of our apartment in a beautiful Greek style villa, I needed two more photos, one of the villa and one of me with the view of the blue bay which is a bit like a fjord on this beautiful peninsula.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj6DF8mYiktFG0JW8QTjBTU1hoAibMHCSAvChaSbt1vI7G6xNqgmotWfIZ3EZ67mZAx5DIxuzpb3ZHH5A_DoDunEYHye89eVL7qsh148hcpEAwlz9KFJlifqVoOq1PPcJaXX3UcbflE7GQje9aO9Z3Gu5Bt8dNItz3PzLdLDL9ga2yDks4D4X0I9A/s4032/20240615_090454.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj6DF8mYiktFG0JW8QTjBTU1hoAibMHCSAvChaSbt1vI7G6xNqgmotWfIZ3EZ67mZAx5DIxuzpb3ZHH5A_DoDunEYHye89eVL7qsh148hcpEAwlz9KFJlifqVoOq1PPcJaXX3UcbflE7GQje9aO9Z3Gu5Bt8dNItz3PzLdLDL9ga2yDks4D4X0I9A/w400-h180/20240615_090454.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our pad at Blue Bay Apartments near Syvota last Saturday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuHx3p4d4OVG_cd95aG1HyjjdbqEhDVWi5lXtqggA0OxR54iIbfRKiHpOE3dwXQUg9fpXzieFFR0S-7ncgRL6QV4vMO9LRQq_YUoWxaP_cHWjVh2hec2INt4aUMti7_eRunlTo71Nnaq2P4CTWj8DHFKbqV_Vc6L9JdPVKgitEFDGcqIZihr3J-g/s4032/20240615_090524.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuHx3p4d4OVG_cd95aG1HyjjdbqEhDVWi5lXtqggA0OxR54iIbfRKiHpOE3dwXQUg9fpXzieFFR0S-7ncgRL6QV4vMO9LRQq_YUoWxaP_cHWjVh2hec2INt4aUMti7_eRunlTo71Nnaq2P4CTWj8DHFKbqV_Vc6L9JdPVKgitEFDGcqIZihr3J-g/w400-h180/20240615_090524.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Worth staying there just for the views</i></td></tr></tbody></table>It was a short drive to Syvota which has 900 inhabitants and is a quiet harbour village. There were tourists and locals around but nothing like in Italy. Before exploring the village, we went to a chemist to get more seasickness tablets for the ferry. Somehow we lost the ones we bought for the crossing to Durres. From there we walked towards the port and felt good vibes immediately. I told Eladio no one could be unhappy there it's just so pretty and special. It is clean and stylish in a very Greek way with enticing taverns we wouldn't eat at but loved. This is where a very kind young waiter from Plataria took this week's feature photo. Epharisto. When my dear friend Sandra saw it on social media she made me laugh when she wrote: "You guys look quite the Onassis couple! Jet set life suits you! You both look fabulous especially the lady in red". Oh, Sandy, Onassis was ugly and Eladio is handsome and Onassis was rich and Eladio isn't. And as to the jet set life, that is not ours. We are on a low to medium budget road trip not staying anywhere luxurious.  Even my red dress is low budget as I got it at a street market in Ostune. My friend did make me laugh though. I suppose we are quite a handsome couple for our age, in our 60's and 70's even if I say so myself. That, my friends is on the outside. <div><br></br></div><div>But back to pretty Syvota (also spelled Sivota)  here is a photo of the bay.<table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqKOSLnI4fSmo3ogTgZhqnEzztavGZwH7C9KdAUn8W-2qEcaeSOrVLqFn9y6QOvPX__lfoQ9sGMwuetaqpPLuNlvOsabgIZPeYJXWdHVz-iAr4mvfKzgdnObFfIsr5FadJB4-jMPOTeahLjGWqY7wwCLA6lqNQwTT1RbuWYz6Mp9wiAzKVvBFWUQ/s4032/20240615_095536.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqKOSLnI4fSmo3ogTgZhqnEzztavGZwH7C9KdAUn8W-2qEcaeSOrVLqFn9y6QOvPX__lfoQ9sGMwuetaqpPLuNlvOsabgIZPeYJXWdHVz-iAr4mvfKzgdnObFfIsr5FadJB4-jMPOTeahLjGWqY7wwCLA6lqNQwTT1RbuWYz6Mp9wiAzKVvBFWUQ/w400-h180/20240615_095536.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Pretty and quiet Syvota</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We bought some provisions at a small supermarket and Eladio was delighted to find Weetabix. I wondered who buys them there. But that's what he likes most for breakfast. Years ago my parents used to bring them to Madrid from Bradford for him and once my Father wrote to Weetabix to encourage them to sell their cereals in Spain. I remember that as if it were yesterday. <div><br></br></div><div>We were walking back to our car when we saw the typical touristy sign with the name of the village and had to have more photos. Here is one.

It was a beautiful road and we enjoyed the drive. Parga is better known and larger with over 3000 inhabitants. It has a town beach supposed to be one of the best in Greece but I was not impressed. I was more impressed with the promenade and views of the castle and island of the Virgin Mary. There is lots going for Parga and again I wished we had stayed longer. Here are some pictures for you to get an idea if you haven't been there before. I can really recommend it.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJVfmbeZSOjO-FKEG3dF_faUES7qXUGXbmDHHZC72LE12bkRFG1maJ6EPapv2ItOFgpqGWpOFJjafg1xW_D2rURtb5IOFIonyiW6aMv8hJ04su9vshC-11Qwxj3IwS-glEf2ZEvjpj-9lEdZHm9XMZx593VpMCyGd720CiQw8kmGQwps7bh9kWvg/s4032/20240615_112323.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJVfmbeZSOjO-FKEG3dF_faUES7qXUGXbmDHHZC72LE12bkRFG1maJ6EPapv2ItOFgpqGWpOFJjafg1xW_D2rURtb5IOFIonyiW6aMv8hJ04su9vshC-11Qwxj3IwS-glEf2ZEvjpj-9lEdZHm9XMZx593VpMCyGd720CiQw8kmGQwps7bh9kWvg/w400-h180/20240615_112323.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjHnPiAnX37_Cj8eb8cPAlOC3l_dtZTPgM_bLh5w-D4y56jOlFm3Q_5gCubk34UhPVpZm2dPwT0sL7JxLborBJAgFEUjtIt4U4YyhOJNFFW6y0UhqQ0Yf7VshrAESnUk86Jbzi1dUz25vVjrjTFsFBhJ4VqkibC_INm_EPjHhaDiqqiZA02wq1S-w/s4032/20240615_123832.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjHnPiAnX37_Cj8eb8cPAlOC3l_dtZTPgM_bLh5w-D4y56jOlFm3Q_5gCubk34UhPVpZm2dPwT0sL7JxLborBJAgFEUjtIt4U4YyhOJNFFW6y0UhqQ0Yf7VshrAESnUk86Jbzi1dUz25vVjrjTFsFBhJ4VqkibC_INm_EPjHhaDiqqiZA02wq1S-w/w400-h180/20240615_123832.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Parga is stunning</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We had an expensive coffee on the seafront, double what it would cost in Spain which surprised me as Greece is supposed to be cheaper. Maybe it is for some things but not others. We then went to check out the pretty narrow streets with enticing shops which I should add sell wares at a much cheaper price than in Italy. We bought two lovely summer outfits for Juliet and Elliot. As we  continued our walk along the main street we heard singing. We stopped to listen and were offered a veritable concert. Honestly it was the highlight of the week. I'm afraid I deleted the video I took (boohoo) but what a moment.  A Greek lady sat down with me on the kerb, listening and watching because they danced too. She told me they were the choir singers of a local Orthodox monastery and insisted on introducing me to their priest. I was wearing my gold cross so they assumed I was Christian and wanted to know if I was Orthodox. I am, of course, with my heritage and was baptised at the Russian Orthodox church in Paris. I had to tell the long bearded priest my grandfather was also an Orthodox priest and we immediately connected. I asked him to bless me and it was a wonderful moment. I then joined in the dancing in the middle of the street. I never dance but I just had to that day. It was a very special and emotional moment. As I told the singers and dancers, "only in Greece" which they loved. <div><br></br></div><div>We walked back to our car by the beach feeling energised and happy and delighted with the morning we had spent exploring Syvota and Parga. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We came "home" to our apartment to have lunch - Friday's leftovers from the Kokosis restaurant in Plataria. Then we had free time until it was time to leave and drive to Igoumenitsa to catch the midnight ferry to Bari. I had to pack 2 bags with all the stuff we would need on board, including our breakfast so as not to carry heavy luggage onto the ferry. </div><div><br></br></div><div>I spent my free time writing this blog and as soon as I was finished, I donned my swimming costume and was soon sitting by the amazing infinity pool that blended with the sea. It's one of the best pools I have ever been in and reminded me of our time at the Dead Sea in  Jordan where there was a similar one, not that the Dead Sea can be compared to the Ionian Sea.  Eladio joined me later and totally agreed. The wonderful thing is that we had the place to ourselves. What luxury.</div><div><br></br></div><div>While we were enjoying the last few hours of our stay at Blue Bay apartments, Olivia, our youngest daughter was enjoying freedom in Bordeaux. She had gone with her French class for a long weekend. Her French classes which she attended last year at the Official School of Languages is one of the joys of her life and she finished this year's studies with flying colours. She had been looking forward to the class trip, to being in France which she loves, but also for some freedom from motherhood, something I completely understand.

When I use them in Spain I shall remember this tripm <div><br></br></div><div>We drove to Igoumenitsa which seems to be just a port city. Our ferry to Bari was leaving at 11.45 and we had to be there 3 hours before. The whole place was chaos, compared to when we crossed from Bari to Durres (Albania) a few weeks ago. There were no signs or any indication as to what we had to do after check in. To top that, they separated the drivers from the passengers which we were not happy about. We finally ended up in a queue of traffic with vehicles from all over the world. We would have a very long wait as the ferry, coming from Patras, did not arrive until 12.45.

In their group they have Italy and Croatia which is not an easy group. But they beat them 3-0 which was a great start. In the queue of cars, ours was the only one with a Spanish registration plate so no one else was in the least interested. Most vehicles came from Turkey but also Greece, Italy, Germany, France, Switzerland and a few other countries. We got talking to a young Turk, Fatih, from Istanbul who was travelling with his father to Rome. Fatih spoke good English, unlike most Turks. When I told him that a young Turkish teacher of English told me that's because Erdogan invests more in religion than he does in education or language learning, he sadly agreed with me. We are now friends on Instagram. One of the things we love about our travels is meeting people from other countries. The funny thing is that they are equally interested in meeting us. <div><br></br></div><div>Back to the supposed Super Fast ferry whose name I never knew. It finally arrived and took quite a while to fill up all the vehicles. We were in our berth by 1 am which was acceptable. I have to say the ferry and our berth were much better than on the crossing to Durres. I was pleasantly surprised to find a big cabin with 2 single beds and a full bathroom with a shower, as well as sockets that worked.  However, I only slept 4.5h. </div><div><br></br></div><div>On <b>Sunday morning</b> I was awake at 6.30 which was 7.30 in Greece. Soon I was on deck with my coffee and happy to find TIM (Italian operator) had coverage an hour away from land. We had breakfast in our berth, washed and packed and were soon on deck again watching the ferry arrive in Bari, a huge port in Puglia. But OMG, our wait was long. The arrival was around 10 am but we didn't get out of Bari until at least 11.30 - what a boring wait.  Before leaving, I took a photo of Eladio outside our very nice berth.

We were driving to Vieste on the supposedly pretty Gargano National Park (a peninsula on the knob of the heel of Italy). Leaving Bari, we spied a huge Lidl. We made a beeline for it and got lots of provisions to last us a few days including my favourite; porchetta.</div><div><br></br></div><div>The distance to Vieste was only about 168km but would take nearly 3h as there isn't a motorway. We took turns driving as we were both absolutely bushed, exhausted from the ferry experience and lack of sleep. The drive was long and difficult on very narrow and mountainous roads. Our GPS seemed to take us off piste at times which was stressful. </div><div><br></br></div><div>As we were driving I remembered it was Olivia and Miguel's first anniversary.

We liked the place but all we wanted to do was to settle in, have some lunch and rest. However, the receptionist insisted on explaining all the things to do and see in Vieste, a pretty town with a centro storico in the heart of the Gargano area. Finally we were in our new villa and we liked it. Thankfully, it wasn't too hot with the temperature being about 26c, a lot better than in Turkey.

Florence, Cinque Terre and the Amalfi Coast  were bad enough. <br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjEixWHLqiGVSUDorU0rF1VBUAfUTjR92aGQQUdXWC5auLkfZg4q4FRnsQzFBhr7mhgMdJNBy14ZqpUstJolCKwrvsQ3vOQXKw8ZyAye9swZ8bK7GKg7b47OPeT57jFo-jvgY32juwcuOTQv-QtY8VZ02vosmYl1f6Wz7BqcSuPyPfhcCWAw-2g3g/s4032/20240617_094859.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjEixWHLqiGVSUDorU0rF1VBUAfUTjR92aGQQUdXWC5auLkfZg4q4FRnsQzFBhr7mhgMdJNBy14ZqpUstJolCKwrvsQ3vOQXKw8ZyAye9swZ8bK7GKg7b47OPeT57jFo-jvgY32juwcuOTQv-QtY8VZ02vosmYl1f6Wz7BqcSuPyPfhcCWAw-2g3g/w400-h180/20240617_094859.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><br></br><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyyp8DnR5Z3pmk0SN_0RUA5325kI4oHh9FgKKnicwSUykjugjyVeUs-stbv06gYZXogLTQGuOL3Gw6TitRihNKDjPrCR8ePMGqlqQl-gsh90qfPaKOXgKCXJ9AuS1YKyz8XCE914F6sE2RMdhEYh0gDfe-ztKG7N1gN4Z-m1OUH4-GnXq-PsTXEA/s2000/IMG-20240617-WA0008.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyyp8DnR5Z3pmk0SN_0RUA5325kI4oHh9FgKKnicwSUykjugjyVeUs-stbv06gYZXogLTQGuOL3Gw6TitRihNKDjPrCR8ePMGqlqQl-gsh90qfPaKOXgKCXJ9AuS1YKyz8XCE914F6sE2RMdhEYh0gDfe-ztKG7N1gN4Z-m1OUH4-GnXq-PsTXEA/w400-h300/IMG-20240617-WA0008.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Vieste the City on a rock - so beautiful<br></br></i></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: justify;">On the other side, the view was of the small beach in the town where I posed for another photo. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgwmgnb3MGJzXzsGhVAKC_W6IHdZ_fA8550o1udN0TYZ1dwvCFPXRMHdLeKjwEohVrwrTBRUMK9bEwBTVw4D527Iytc8FmUER8G9i2cnnIlFpNO5DUE4asNdWPm0VdFpXaLfdivC0UgXHwP9Aw-EaFgA3rk8TjZ-T45lO1_5x35e8jNN0cXQJF37g/s4032/20240617_095912.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgwmgnb3MGJzXzsGhVAKC_W6IHdZ_fA8550o1udN0TYZ1dwvCFPXRMHdLeKjwEohVrwrTBRUMK9bEwBTVw4D527Iytc8FmUER8G9i2cnnIlFpNO5DUE4asNdWPm0VdFpXaLfdivC0UgXHwP9Aw-EaFgA3rk8TjZ-T45lO1_5x35e8jNN0cXQJF37g/w400-h180/20240617_095912.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The view of the new city from Vieste Vecchia</i></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br></br><div><span style="text-align: justify;">Notice I am wearing my lovely blue and white Turkish frock I got for 10 euros near Pamukkale. I love both this frock and the red and white one I bought at a market in Ostuni. I have been wearing the blue and white one nearly every day since I bought it but don't dare wash it as the colours may run. I noticed that when I tried to take a food stain out. Once home, it will be washed by hand and in cold water. </span></div><div><br></br></div><div>We then walked down to the modern part of the rather white town - nearly all the buildings are white which makes for a pretty contrast with the sea. After a much needed cappuccino and latte macchiato we visited another market where plenty of locals were buying fruit and veg. We spied some huge black and juicy cherries and bought half a kilo. I then noticed they were from Murcia, Spain. Really? There was lots of olive oil on sale and it looked good but, like everywhere else we have been, it is more expensive than in Spain. In any case buying oil in Italy to take home would be like taking coals to Newcastle. So no, we didn't buy any.</div><div><br></br></div><div>We were back at our magnificent accommodation at about 12.30 with plenty of time to spend by the pool which that morning I had almost to myself.

Tuesday was the end of our stay in Vieste and in Puglia which we will always remember. Our next destination was just 150km north on the Adriatic Coast to another interesting town; Vasto in Abruzzo.  We didn't have a long drive and wanted to stop in Peschici on the way as it looked charming and has a lot of history. <br></br><div><br></br></div><div>We did the right thing. It is absolutely stunning, prettier than Vieste and smaller. It's another typical Italian medieval village perched on a cliff and being on the Adriatic, overlooking the sea. What could be prettier? It is located at  the northernmost point of the region and is of Slavic origins. Legend has it a group of Slavs were sent by monks from the Tremiti islands to set up an abbey but the opposite happened. The people of Pescia gave their church and castle to the island abbey in exchange for protection from Saracen (Moorish) pirates. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1mSeBv77gXglPyS6fvoavAC-9py154RZ2iQvnIQ5zzWglP_3gEx9i357l72X9sJdzYQwKBwM7Y0YoELCAzcHnQG8ftW3P4TLxb4W9M59v8dGWudimgvGtv2-FGkL4QWhPL94ojh8gAcVuFd0Zvy1-zyN-jPmn9U3Q8gIDiCyGX6wHjJZeOC9Fvg/s1200/holiday-village-vieste-camping-village-puglia-cosa-fare-peschici-04.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="266" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1mSeBv77gXglPyS6fvoavAC-9py154RZ2iQvnIQ5zzWglP_3gEx9i357l72X9sJdzYQwKBwM7Y0YoELCAzcHnQG8ftW3P4TLxb4W9M59v8dGWudimgvGtv2-FGkL4QWhPL94ojh8gAcVuFd0Zvy1-zyN-jPmn9U3Q8gIDiCyGX6wHjJZeOC9Fvg/w400-h266/holiday-village-vieste-camping-village-puglia-cosa-fare-peschici-04.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Peschici, what a find on the Adriatic Sea in the Gargano Peninsula</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We parked our car right next to the centro storico and walked through one of the main stone gates into a maze of cobbled streets where it would be easy to get lost. We loved every street we saw and could spy the sea from many corners.  From the 10th century castle there is a great viewing point of the sea.  And I just loved the old houses, most of them white and some white and blue in a sort of oriental style. Here are some pictures of this delightful village, a jewel on the Adriatic Coast and in Gargano. <br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhE3AI8yaislFG0Efa1S_E0HtgCk8KbH1vqc2E88tEDQmqMMGyB88gax7S0VCYWi-vno7elhFIAoWGSHjE1pEZ7i_XyalSm6sNgWak4dMGfkklmgML7syWOP6IzS6ZDJgYMSWWsu1dERim8RDkBQLu2lwzFGuDhZGZPjuhXnRKjMvPcYIYDSOuJrQ/s3007/20240618_104300.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhE3AI8yaislFG0Efa1S_E0HtgCk8KbH1vqc2E88tEDQmqMMGyB88gax7S0VCYWi-vno7elhFIAoWGSHjE1pEZ7i_XyalSm6sNgWak4dMGfkklmgML7syWOP6IzS6ZDJgYMSWWsu1dERim8RDkBQLu2lwzFGuDhZGZPjuhXnRKjMvPcYIYDSOuJrQ/w240-h400/20240618_104300.jpg" width="240"></img></a></div><br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgA_hULkNChPlqgLSe5Ty66MqG_AduVpLEBA_2jUmTGAqeb2eBQGsmq601uY3_pVtgoV1EDaLmttDnkiZt4CAjDEC8YQpBSxJ9I6vXQPavs_LBtxFtt0GJYMXHSgxho3Zt8lYn5KkKDblC0Xwv9amruj4_ZoCzvNxvB4cTCy4qtqefz68D4pDGfJw/s4032/20240618_104427.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgA_hULkNChPlqgLSe5Ty66MqG_AduVpLEBA_2jUmTGAqeb2eBQGsmq601uY3_pVtgoV1EDaLmttDnkiZt4CAjDEC8YQpBSxJ9I6vXQPavs_LBtxFtt0GJYMXHSgxho3Zt8lYn5KkKDblC0Xwv9amruj4_ZoCzvNxvB4cTCy4qtqefz68D4pDGfJw/w400-h180/20240618_104427.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKRrncQpqBXyzBvIbF1mCon2BSHztBkoOe8nG-aTdfSZnt348fBsm2bhs1bCLM4Saf9QJaAQSVEpeMIs8DgrsCGeXzxEgNcivwHMYGwWJ5hxyLxCsaiWfvsUnV78rcBuEnXu_WlbI68UitFy3gWqiOHC0iaKOSjXIOL-HBkqV9lZJOSswGCgAJZA/s4032/20240618_105455.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKRrncQpqBXyzBvIbF1mCon2BSHztBkoOe8nG-aTdfSZnt348fBsm2bhs1bCLM4Saf9QJaAQSVEpeMIs8DgrsCGeXzxEgNcivwHMYGwWJ5hxyLxCsaiWfvsUnV78rcBuEnXu_WlbI68UitFy3gWqiOHC0iaKOSjXIOL-HBkqV9lZJOSswGCgAJZA/w400-h180/20240618_105455.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPkj3JJR2n9wniXWR_8fkL4Goyk5-91jdJQ1G-FK_Msgv5UGHYqxWyBAJZA7PKBCmCrdXUOV3Zlhe9icK8aBAmdM-uJ6QNeyNyMhQvObmNZkr2KwFOhT0oeFczFhkPzsBWjU-Ng8PLCaUPvpmVmc1iKDO70CycZcpkjl4Nq3TYaNa8teNc7QSdnA/s4032/20240618_110352.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjPkj3JJR2n9wniXWR_8fkL4Goyk5-91jdJQ1G-FK_Msgv5UGHYqxWyBAJZA7PKBCmCrdXUOV3Zlhe9icK8aBAmdM-uJ6QNeyNyMhQvObmNZkr2KwFOhT0oeFczFhkPzsBWjU-Ng8PLCaUPvpmVmc1iKDO70CycZcpkjl4Nq3TYaNa8teNc7QSdnA/w180-h400/20240618_110352.jpg" width="180"></img></a></div><br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7aLxW-OddQnr-5-ruN1ycVuTxW-0lOKW95C8k3J4fIogIJyoqapuQcHvHpuoRb28wgrK_iQmkPUM5_xHdM-0gi4KpyjzVMVU9BxhQN-iZRMAWULQ8wbi-xFkMwH77a3nD94xSip39uyZ44Jiy2HAi1jsbDeCRVmElbZ_q-6i_xs2hn_DlGZOkQQ/s4032/20240618_110755.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7aLxW-OddQnr-5-ruN1ycVuTxW-0lOKW95C8k3J4fIogIJyoqapuQcHvHpuoRb28wgrK_iQmkPUM5_xHdM-0gi4KpyjzVMVU9BxhQN-iZRMAWULQ8wbi-xFkMwH77a3nD94xSip39uyZ44Jiy2HAi1jsbDeCRVmElbZ_q-6i_xs2hn_DlGZOkQQ/w400-h180/20240618_110755.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0Q4XO9_QOlDMEnsahzfvdix-WqMxD7Jhyphenhyphen-oWNxXbtiyg1Ou_VQZVUXZ-agypZN2XKD7pPEJlM0eVRmxy6TrSKiuHrjEP-ww7FuAGmr922aUeaDPspsSchM5qY5lZ3T_e3dJFDalB-o7Vl_pkNXBjr-e9GlFcy8Wqb0LB8I2Komwy06MfUhxplhQ/s4032/20240618_111301.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0Q4XO9_QOlDMEnsahzfvdix-WqMxD7Jhyphenhyphen-oWNxXbtiyg1Ou_VQZVUXZ-agypZN2XKD7pPEJlM0eVRmxy6TrSKiuHrjEP-ww7FuAGmr922aUeaDPspsSchM5qY5lZ3T_e3dJFDalB-o7Vl_pkNXBjr-e9GlFcy8Wqb0LB8I2Komwy06MfUhxplhQ/w400-h180/20240618_111301.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Beautiful Peschici (pronounced Péskichi)</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Before we left for Vasto we had our customary cappuccino and latte macchiato at a very friendly bar - Celestino, outside the city walls. We didn't have a long drive to Vasto but oh my God the roads are frightening on the Gargano Peninsula and it took ages until we were on the Bari to Bologna autostrada. Driving in the Gargano region is not for the weak hearted. Distances look small on the map but the roads are so narrow and steep it's very challenging. That's why we didn't go further afield from Vieste to lots of recommended places nearby. Just a 20km drive could take up to nearly an hour!</div><div><br></br></div><div>Finally we were on the motorway and arrived in Vasto at around 2pm. Vasto is not on the tourist map but it has a lot going for it - a nice beach and another medieval town on a cliff - we have seen so many. We chose it because its on our route and because it has a bit of history. Researching the place I came across an <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/activity-and-adventure/italian-region-beautiful-landscapes-ancient-villages-no-tourists/">article</a> from The Telegraph singing its praises. One good thing going for it is that it does not suffer from "over tourism" like so many parts of Italy. </div><div><br></br></div><div> Before checking into our new accommodation (not my favourite) we went to have lunch at Trattoria Toscana which was a bit disappointing although it came recommended by our host and on Trip Advisor.</div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4hTGqfK76RaCt2g5ZnqP0Fap4HQ5oMzq9TdGHWU33XlvOJ9IArllmBIXZvO3JVxKTMGF0Qgf9gO_G1l4slcMyoHUR0gVBuA0Z8ouS2UfrH_Tb_Rbmz8YowD_rYjNpoz_EqP47ResumgbpSEAR8T_KBOGnrsLjic3Q188Hugefgqx2D8svX255IQ/s4032/20240618_142900.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4hTGqfK76RaCt2g5ZnqP0Fap4HQ5oMzq9TdGHWU33XlvOJ9IArllmBIXZvO3JVxKTMGF0Qgf9gO_G1l4slcMyoHUR0gVBuA0Z8ouS2UfrH_Tb_Rbmz8YowD_rYjNpoz_EqP47ResumgbpSEAR8T_KBOGnrsLjic3Q188Hugefgqx2D8svX255IQ/w400-h180/20240618_142900.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My okayish lunch at Trattoria Toscana</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>Our new <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/villetta-lena.en-gb.html?label=en-it-booking-desktop-orurobL4HlxlPTbh4QCUzwS652796016213%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atikwd-65526620%3Alp1008623%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw4MSzBhC8ARIsAPFOuyVdUz03vmbIWBJLmu277k8AxqGVpEOm5pcXMroI95V6U4-hHitM-VcaAtLyEALw_wcB&amp;aid=2311236">new accommodation</a> was the top floor of a whole house - very large but rather dated. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiV0f7bgFUStBDg1jWdG6PqfXVRFDGxMzfUBchXw0HpDH1Aq6K8ToPCbG-4PKobeAa2DouW5op8xL6S-IhBTLMCvLG2PPtfvQrSuQuoHWm-eooK-2NpYbTM0HatJsCrVA_HhR1-7q3GxahuRzyvhILkV59S30UokNwoZC64bA4FimFT7L-TSZ43Iw/s2000/IMG-20240619-WA0012.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiV0f7bgFUStBDg1jWdG6PqfXVRFDGxMzfUBchXw0HpDH1Aq6K8ToPCbG-4PKobeAa2DouW5op8xL6S-IhBTLMCvLG2PPtfvQrSuQuoHWm-eooK-2NpYbTM0HatJsCrVA_HhR1-7q3GxahuRzyvhILkV59S30UokNwoZC64bA4FimFT7L-TSZ43Iw/s320/IMG-20240619-WA0012.jpg" width="320"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our "house" in Vasto - not the best place we have stayed at - missing an infinity pool (hahaha)</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>It was like stepping into a 60's home. I reckon it is the former house of the owner's grandmother. I could  tell by the bathroom fixtures and tiles.  I honestly wondered why it had a 9.8 out of 10 on Booking. Goes to show people's opinions differ. The location was so-so, about 900 metres to the beach (Marina di Vasto) and 2km from the old town. But it was large and had everything we needed. We soon settled in and spent the rest of the afternoon doing bits and bobs, including putting on a washing machine. My main job was to find accommodation for our next destination, San Marino  I have always been curious about this country which is basically a small city on a rock in Italy. I didn't find anything  in the city within our budget so went for the seaside Marina Centro next to Rimini from where San Marino is very near. </div><div><br></br></div><div>As always, we were up early on <b>Wednesday</b> morning and keen to visit the historic centre of Vasto. It lies on a hill, like so many Italian towns for defense against invaders who eventually captured them anyway. We had seen it from the Marina di Vasto - the beach part of the town and it looked enticing.</div><div><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgoNv2UFkvRBPXaG7mM1GixdxHYTww6n1262TgLQo8iMm4u83vWmP32Cf7z5-kENN2KTs_CUt2NROjo2JvcWYvKJ8oplFfD5mpi2qTWUJOjRFFuh6OwJ-4qTH7e2fQHjZu2bayyrXY8Q30ZpTnU7ScDQAV_UyWM3UJ_l9mGBE5Q9OjhBkJybbJ4-Q/s1024/VAsto-Abruzzo-Italy_11.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="266" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgoNv2UFkvRBPXaG7mM1GixdxHYTww6n1262TgLQo8iMm4u83vWmP32Cf7z5-kENN2KTs_CUt2NROjo2JvcWYvKJ8oplFfD5mpi2qTWUJOjRFFuh6OwJ-4qTH7e2fQHjZu2bayyrXY8Q30ZpTnU7ScDQAV_UyWM3UJ_l9mGBE5Q9OjhBkJybbJ4-Q/w400-h266/VAsto-Abruzzo-Italy_11.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Vasto old town skyline</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We were in the beautiful Piazza Rossetti by 9 am where one of the main landmarks is located, the Bassano Tower.  I later read that the old town's layout was mostly built in the 15th century but partially destroyed by the Turks in 1566.

The water was a bit green compared to "our beach" near Santa Pola, but it seemed clean enough. We had a coffee on the beach too, sitting in the shade. We are both very brown or rather I am tanned and Eladio is as dark as an Indian and looking gorgeous. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We spent about 2h on the beach including coffee time.  We then went in search of a supermarket but got lost in the process and ended up driving 10km to a local Lidl -not my favourite supermarket. We came home to shower and make lunch and then spend a lazy afternoon in the flat.</div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Thursday</b> came and that day we drove to Rimini, also famous for its history and beach. That's the good thing about the Adriatic coast - there is both history and culture as well as sunny beaches; the best of two worlds (for some). </div><div><div><br></br></div></div></div></div></div></div><div>The drive was all motorway which cost a bomb but was worth it. We were staying at a hotel with apartments a couple of blocks from the enormous Marina Centro Beach which we would see later. We had an argument with the manager about paying for parking our car on the premises which they had told me in advance was free so we did not get off to a good start. The place was good enough but a bit jaded. Eladio never criticises any of the places we stay at. He doesn't care about the decor and never sees the grout but I do. It ticked all the boxes though and we were quite happy there for 2 nights. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Thursday 20th June was the summer solstice, the longest day of the year. In Rimini the sunset was at 9.30, whereas in Spain it was at 10.30. Thursday was also the day Spain played Italy in the qualifying rounds of this year's Euro Cup. It felt like being in the enemy camp. Spain has a good team but has always been spooked by Italy so my hopes were not very high. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We went out in the early evening to walk along the beach. It was very hazy with  no sun which made the solstice a bit disappointing. It's so different to the beaches I know in Spain which are mostly wild with only the odd "chirringuito" (beach bar), sun beds and parasols and maybe surfing but not much more. Marina Centro beach seems so built up and consists of lots of different businesses practically owning parts of the beach. From the promenade you couldn't see the sea itself because of so much beach paraphernalia. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8DnEHZzTjAv_9QUZqbM8_ISi_AlPZARQV92dZPDO40ygvmDWqBh5m3Uz-GzRGNLof5-GGCyN9nZI6xiRjOOGVIDRg86vU3RNfTHsOUxw5BZ6c4kNeRYMwlmg9IP2mtr6gvPZYejjVdNvELPLHAjEHoOTbbbZGxAkm1S6qFMW1g8eL3uZBOiBR1g/s4032/20240620_181805.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8DnEHZzTjAv_9QUZqbM8_ISi_AlPZARQV92dZPDO40ygvmDWqBh5m3Uz-GzRGNLof5-GGCyN9nZI6xiRjOOGVIDRg86vU3RNfTHsOUxw5BZ6c4kNeRYMwlmg9IP2mtr6gvPZYejjVdNvELPLHAjEHoOTbbbZGxAkm1S6qFMW1g8eL3uZBOiBR1g/w400-h180/20240620_181805.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Rimini's Marina Centro beach is all built up you can hardly see the sea</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>Many of them are associated to many of the hotels in the area.  To me it looked like one big beach party. I also got the impression that Rimini Marina Centro is Italy's equivalent to Ibiza  -in terms of partying. Not my thing. I far prefer the Playa de Póo in Asturias or our own beach near Santa Pola. But, each to their own and Rimini is a very popular holiday location. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We walked a long way but did not get to the end of the promenade. i later read it is 15km long. It was hot, hazy and sticky and after a while we came back to our strangely air conditioned apartment. I say "strangely" because it only worked if you had all the doors closed, including the bathroom and kitchen doors. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Eladio watched the end of the Denmark England match which resulted in a 1-1 draw. I read that England didn't give their all but I didn't see it so can't judge. After a simple dinner, Eladio watched the Spain Italy match which was perhaps the most anticipated match of the qualifying rounds. Spain have never played well against Italy but they did that night, winning 1-0 after an own goal from the Italians. In my humble opinion that's not the best way to win. Poor Eladio had to watch the match on my PC (thanks to my Express VPN), alone and with his headphones on. I was not interested and continued watching my current favourite series, Our Girl on BBC iPlayer.</div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Friday</b> dawned and it was hot, hazy and sticky again. In Madrid, our home town, however, it was a lot cooler and had even rained which is good for the garden. It was an important day for our grandchildren, Elliot and Juliet aged nearly 3 and 5. That day Elliot received his first judo belt, the yellow and white one. Olivia sent us a photo of that moment, next to his judo instructor who has a black belt. I later found out the meanings of the colour of belts in this oriental sport; white means a new slate and yellow a progressive stage of learning and skill. Elliot loves his judo classes.

The city where Federico Felini was born and whose film La Dolce Vita has gone down in history, is one of the most famous seaside resorts in Europe. But it also has a lot of history, mainly from Roman times which figures. </div><div><br></br></div><div>I was almost grateful the sun was behind the clouds as we visited the old town of Rimini which for us, at least, was much more interesting than the beach. As experienced sightseers, we were there at 9 am, early enough to beat any crowds and not yet too hot. I was the guide that day and my tools were basically either the Italian tourist page Italy.It  or Wikipedia and Google Maps. I read that the history of the city dates back to 268 BC thanks to the foresight of the emperors Augustus, Tiberius and Hadrian who saw the city as the perfect meeting point between two of the most important Roman roads, Flaminia and Emilia.

Sadly, the walls it was joined to are no longer there, mostly because of bombing during WWII I presume.

Later it became a market square and was then renamed after three young partisans who were executed there in 1944. There is also another important symbol of the city, the Torre dell'Orologio (Clock Tower). Oh, how the Italians love their clock towers.

Thus I wasn't surprised when Eladio mumbled to me while I was enthusiastically doing my guided tour, that he was suffering a bit from the Stendhal Syndrome. I totally understood and felt a bit the same myself, but couldn't ignore all there was to see in Rimini, after we had come so far to see it. Thus we made a halt and walked back to the attractive Piazza Cavour to have a delicious cappuccino and latte machiato. The waiter asked if we were from Argentina or Spain. When we said the latter, he mentioned the all important UEFA Euro Cup match Spain had won the night before. But he also said he kept Alvaro Morato, the Spanish Squad captain, in his heart. I wondered why. The answer was simple, he married an Italian girl and plays for the "Juve" (Juventus team).

It was once the capital of the Western Roman Empire and then was taken over by the Goths and became the Ostrogothic Kingdom and finally was ruled by the Papacy until it became part of Italy. There is so much to see you don't know where to start. Just Ravenna has 8 Unesco World Heritage sites.  We were in the Piazza del Populo by about 12.

Plus, it was so hot, we needed fortifiying. I found an expensive rip off place where we had a tiny dish of pasta each and it came to over 50 euros. I haven't learned my lesson have I?<div><br></br></div><div>Only then could we concentrate on seeing the sights. Our first stop was the Basilica San Vitale. There we had to buy tickets which could be also be used to see the Galla Placida Mauseleum, the Neonian Baptistery, the Bishops' palace which is now a museum and the other famous Basilica di Sant'Apollinare. They all have some fantastic mosaics. I read that the city has the finest collection of Byzantine mosaics in Italy. It was craftsmen who were brought to Italy from Constantinople when Justinian was the Roman Emperor. They created some amazing scenes, that have been preserved and can be seen in the main sights of the city. </div><div><br></br></div><div>I have had some PC issues (long story) so none of the photos below are in the right order. But I will still post them and if you are interested you can see what is what thanks to the captions. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We first visited the Mauseleum which, although tiny, impressed me most because it's just full of mosaics. The funny thing is the buildings themselves are not that special. It's the inside that really makes an impact. When we walked into the Basilica de San Vitale, Eladio whispered to me it was the most beautiful building he had ever seen. I whispered back that the Taj Mahal still beats it, hahaha. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Ah, and we also visited Dante Alighieri's tomb which is another top sight in beautiful Ravenna.<br></br><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

Finding Fabbri Amarena cherries.  The journey home through Diano Marina on the Italian Riviera,  Nîmes – the French Rome -  and back to Spain. Home again, reunion with Pippa and our grandchildren.</a><a href="/posts/2024-06-14-week-6-of-this-years-road-trip-pamukkale-the-white-cotton-ca.html" class="post-nav-link nav-older">Week 6 of this year&#x27;s road trip. Pamukkale the white cotton castle of Turkey and  bathing in Cleopatra&#x27;s pool at Hierapolis.  Cats and dogs in Turkey. Visiting the red springs of Karahayit and the ancient Biblical city of  Laodicea.  Back to the Dardanelles. Güle güle Asia Minor, Γειά σου Greece. A hell of a journey to Greece, time out in Thessalonika and so to Plataria on the Ionian Sea.  Alcaraz wins Roland Garros. &rarr;</a></nav>
