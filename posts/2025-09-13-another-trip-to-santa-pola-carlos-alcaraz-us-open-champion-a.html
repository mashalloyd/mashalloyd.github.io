We usually see each other once a year, at least but this time it has been 3 years since we last met so we were all looking forward to some fun together in the sun and on the beach and we got it as you will read on.&nbsp;</p><p>We left home, for the umpteenth time this summer, at around 10 a.m. stopping to do a food shop and for coffee and not much more. This was to be our 5th visit here this year so far. We arrived at around 3.30 and after settling in had a makeshift lunch. Gina had cleaned the apartment beautifully so all we had to do was unpack and move in. In the old days we did the cleaning ourselves on arrival and departure which was always a bore.&nbsp;</p><p>Last Sunday was of course the day that the world's top men's tennis seeds were to meet in the US Open Final. Number 1, Jannik Sinner aged 24 from Italy was playing Number 2 Carlos Alcaraz aged 22 from Spain and we were all rooting for Carlitos. If he came out victorious he would become the world's number one again and importantly too would garner his 6th Grand Slam. I felt like Carlos's mother and found the match far too tense to watch. If I was his mother I would have probably had a heart attack. In the end the Spaniard won with his incredible serve and essentially quashed the more predictable Italian who could only gawp at how his rival played in the Arthur Ashe Court in Flushing Meadows last Sunday. Sinner played magnificently of course but Carlos was pure magic. If I couldn't watch the match I loved the ceremony and seeing the young Spaniard lift his second US Open trophy.&nbsp;</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj03pm5SXGjVsrDab3sEOOHcmLPlnQ6HFGQTkWY4RT0ZzuXWAm2UrHq0sZT6nlz943K40deR9bWWqQGJfSP-bh45n1KijkVcUBBhkJc619r9WOXUn9o2apjf9y37fCqIgxn4cbQaZABsTiNqm4Ylf3ffZs2jpvEQe5P1Ce4MgB7k4JRoQvPWfzbpg/s1350/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-09-12%20at%2021.30.47_a62e3e30.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img border="0" data-original-height="1350" data-original-width="1080" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj03pm5SXGjVsrDab3sEOOHcmLPlnQ6HFGQTkWY4RT0ZzuXWAm2UrHq0sZT6nlz943K40deR9bWWqQGJfSP-bh45n1KijkVcUBBhkJc619r9WOXUn9o2apjf9y37fCqIgxn4cbQaZABsTiNqm4Ylf3ffZs2jpvEQe5P1Ce4MgB7k4JRoQvPWfzbpg/w320-h400/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-09-12%20at%2021.30.47_a62e3e30.jpg" width="320" /></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Spain's new tennis wonder kid who has now won the US Open twice aged just 22</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><p>Of course I felt sorry for Sinner but only one can win. The Italian lost the French Open final to Alcaraz and Alcaraz lost this year's Wimbledon final to the Italian and so it will go on. These two men will continue to dominate men's tennis for many years as the big three did. They have stepped into the shoes of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic and made tennis just as exciting again.&nbsp;</p><p>We heard from Suzy after the match and before we went to bed. She had been to her first choir rehearsal with her old music teacher, Javier. She was a bit anxious about how she would perform but all her worries were put paid to when her teacher told her she had done really well and he was counting on her as one of the main singers in the concerts they are preparing. I was so happy to hear that and went to bed a happy lady.</p><p><b>Monday</b> came and thankfully we had done the shopping as it was a local holiday and all the main&nbsp; supermarkets were closed. I loved reading the news about Carlos Alcaraz that morning. Monday 8th was the third anniversary of the death of The Queen and it was probably coincidental but her troubled grandson Harry was in town to see her grave. He later had tea with the King and I hoped that would be the beginning of some kind of reconciliation. Oh what a mess of things he has made. It was back to school for our grandchildren Elliot and Juliet but we didn't get any photos. When the girls were small we took a photo ever year of them going back to school in their uniforms. It seems so long ago now.</p><p>We just had time for a coffee at 11ish before driving to Alicante airport to pick up our friends. They arrived to brilliant sunshine and over 30ºc temperature. But it soon turned cloudy and hazy and would remain like that on Tuesday too. Strong rains were forecast and the local authorities prepared for them as if for a tsunami closing parks and even schools but we never saw a drop here although it did rain heavily in nearby areas causing damage in its wake.&nbsp;</p><p>It was time for lunch when our friends settled in, remembering the place well as they had been here in 2018. Later we spent time at the pool which we had to ourselves. It was lovely but a bit spoiled by the clouds and haze.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgw6eo81xOibYKGi46fvq4cz1KSHSiHo0nqOI3cJbRcVWhyphenhyphen-wa8ysYq_OmkhgeptSMmnK5exCcSZKzgy4L_b10VUwDOt8BjsRZ6KtAN61E6ECFfRxwNAs8J4-pJADALDQdZUDYbnF9iMtirkQPU8VY9UmrVeQuzKy6GJHv1lkp7y0PI5nkkmPenGQ/s4000/20250908_183402.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1848" data-original-width="4000" height="185" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgw6eo81xOibYKGi46fvq4cz1KSHSiHo0nqOI3cJbRcVWhyphenhyphen-wa8ysYq_OmkhgeptSMmnK5exCcSZKzgy4L_b10VUwDOt8BjsRZ6KtAN61E6ECFfRxwNAs8J4-pJADALDQdZUDYbnF9iMtirkQPU8VY9UmrVeQuzKy6GJHv1lkp7y0PI5nkkmPenGQ/w400-h185/20250908_183402.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Kathy and Phil in the pool on Monday afternoon</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We came back for drinks on our small but lovely terrace at around 7pm and have continued the tradition since then. It's my wine and pistachio moment; one I always love and maybe it is not good for my figure but it is for my morale. We went out that night for dinner to La Masia de Chencho, a recent discovery on the outskirts of Elche. We just love that place, the food and the ambience and the class it exhumes. We ate splendidly and I'm afraid I only took a photo of the entrance while outside smoking and texting to my friend Amanda who we had taken there&nbsp; in the spring.<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5cWDmyI0KF-3lEcBXVgmEGMU97F95daE3kjJPn_In05Q9g3K4fn4wsxFJt0wvDXzmBoCkig28HMXuxV05YebS2X_ChrnmdqguuophJjvzA50eAJGUCVLibC-SzUiihYUR68hds5rWImNXhUVMY8cH26aKb3-qBStzXJLtxGcTJNkivIus4uB-FA/s4000/20250908_213830.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="4000" data-original-width="1848" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5cWDmyI0KF-3lEcBXVgmEGMU97F95daE3kjJPn_In05Q9g3K4fn4wsxFJt0wvDXzmBoCkig28HMXuxV05YebS2X_ChrnmdqguuophJjvzA50eAJGUCVLibC-SzUiihYUR68hds5rWImNXhUVMY8cH26aKb3-qBStzXJLtxGcTJNkivIus4uB-FA/w185-h400/20250908_213830.jpg" width="185" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The entrance to La Masia de Chencho surrounded by very tall palm trees</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We were sure it was going to rain on <b>Tuesday</b> so took our friends to visit Elche, famous for its date palm grove and palm tree parks. But we couldn't visit them as for precautionary measures all the parks had been closed as had the schools. All we could do was have a coffee and walk along the old streets. I had an unfortunate incident at the cafe where we were menaced by nasty looking pigeons wanting the nuts that came with Kathy and Phil's beer. I have always hated birds since I watched the famous Hitchcock film and my worst nightmare came true when a a nasty looking pigeon flew to our table but first landed on my head. I screamed of course and we quickly removed the nuts but they still kept coming so we moved to another table. I will not be going to that cafe ever again. What a horrible experience. It's funny how some films can cause trauma. Suzy was traumatized by the film Jaws and refused to go into a pool or the sea for many years. Even today she will only go in knee deep. I was once traumatised by a Dracula film and when my father found me crying in the lounge he rang either ITV or the BBC to complain.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Anyway, after that we wandered the pretty old streets and came to the proverbial town sign you now see everywhere and took some pictures.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4fzOaw0KQt-5k2LreMJZzuvRd7lFKSm5rt0R8MGMzJ7U5SzZw7JvUhj-16i6jubDN_6zM3syZHfwx4-U8qmvqySiAIMJbfZgOBCRfG-imETJ7PkF7YBxJhVeHzsesC2x7zqHgjHRBLFEOxtznzJJW9RDhT83Oz0NKGtGFUJ1caz_SpM07Fx4Dzg/s4000/20250909_122704.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1848" data-original-width="4000" height="185" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi4fzOaw0KQt-5k2LreMJZzuvRd7lFKSm5rt0R8MGMzJ7U5SzZw7JvUhj-16i6jubDN_6zM3syZHfwx4-U8qmvqySiAIMJbfZgOBCRfG-imETJ7PkF7YBxJhVeHzsesC2x7zqHgjHRBLFEOxtznzJJW9RDhT83Oz0NKGtGFUJ1caz_SpM07Fx4Dzg/w400-h185/20250909_122704.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDf4zxEWiN80htRJk3mY7zXSDR2QPfEqCjigR4MHp1rklrWpg3MBFaMp1cOv_Mi_gE-koO27JCDQ8_TGuFI71Z-tvRLz27TwXZuPXi2VniKhaFbdFlybTd6KZFqTAHrk1c-7YBRdqRvktZgioUobcW5Evx5HdXdBP0vNvXzRh9WahaUMXI2uJLAQ/s3227/20250909_122743.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="3227" data-original-width="1848" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDf4zxEWiN80htRJk3mY7zXSDR2QPfEqCjigR4MHp1rklrWpg3MBFaMp1cOv_Mi_gE-koO27JCDQ8_TGuFI71Z-tvRLz27TwXZuPXi2VniKhaFbdFlybTd6KZFqTAHrk1c-7YBRdqRvktZgioUobcW5Evx5HdXdBP0vNvXzRh9WahaUMXI2uJLAQ/w229-h400/20250909_122743.jpg" width="229" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>In Elche on a very hazy day</i></td></tr></tbody></table>The sign is in front of the beautiful Basílica but that was also closed.

We had them with fresh asparagus and Padrón peppers.<div><br /></div><div>We chilled out for the rest of the day and the highlight every evening was our wine or beer and pistachio moment on the terrace before dinner.
