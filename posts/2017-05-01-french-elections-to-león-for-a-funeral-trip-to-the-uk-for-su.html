<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Good morning
everyone,</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Here I am
writing from Suzy’s flat in Hackney London while both by daughters are
asleep.  It’s been 4 months since we saw
Suzy and now we are enjoying a lovely Mother and daughter extended weekend in
the UK which included a trip to the The Cotswolds, a beautiful part of England (an
area of outstanding beauty) I was keen to see for the first time and show the
girls. The name by the way means sheep enclosure fields and oh how beautiful it
was.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">But let me
start from where I left off, last Sunday and St. George’s Day. That day, our
Airbnb guests from Valladolid, who had come for a wedding in Villaviciosa de
Odón left. We had to quickly prepare the rooms for the next arrival. On the
same day, Astrid, a professional golf player from Provence in France was coming
to stay for 3 nights. I’m really enjoying being an Airbnb host. Apart from the
extra pocket money it brings, we get to meet so many nice people. So far we
have had guests from Spain, France, Italy, South Korea and Russia and I have
bookings as far ahead as July of more from Canada, the UK, Colombia, Australia,
Holland as well as from France, Spain and Italy. I am getting some lovely
reviews which are very satisfying.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">There was some
good sporting news on Sunday when Rafa Nadal won a record 10<sup>th</sup> Master’s
tournament in Monaco.  There would be
another win on Saturday when he won the Barcelona Godo championship. Good for
him. He’s only aged 30 and despite his many injuries, I think he can still make
a comeback. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">There was another sporting
victory too on Sunday when the Spanish cyclist, Alejandro Valverde won the
prestigious “Classic” race, </span><span style="color: #333333; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-language: ES;">Liège-Bastogne-Liège. In an emotional interview
afterwards a tearful Valverde paid tribute to </span><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/2017/04/22/italian-cyclist-michele-scarponi-killed-hit-van-training/"><span style="color: #428bca; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; text-decoration-line: none;">Michele Scarponi who was killed on
Saturday after being hit by a van while training</span></a><span style="color: #333333; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-language: ES;"> and said he
would donate his €20,000 winnings from Liège-Bastogne-Liège to the former
Giro d'Italia winner's family.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">But of course
the big news was the French Elections. It was pretty tight with Emmanuel
Macron, aged 39, the ex-socialist coming first just ahead of the dreaded Marine
Le Pene of the far right. Of course they will go through to the next round which
is on 7<sup>th</sup> May and most of the world is hoping Le Pene won’t win
which would mean France could well leave the EU and all that that would entail.
<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">My French
guest, Astrid, had voted for Macron who, I later found out is married to his
former teacher, Brigitte Trogneux aged 64. When he was 15 he told his 40 odd
year old teacher he would marry her and he did. It’s funny how we all seem to
accept an older man marrying a younger woman and don’t bat an eyelid but when
it’s the other way round it’s a different case.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Monday started
off peacefully. But it would turn out to be the saddest day in the lives of
Eladio’s family.  Little did we know how
it would turn out when Eladio, I and the dogs went for our morning walk. It was
just past 9 in the morning when we got the devastating message from Eladio’s
younger sister to tell us her husband had passed away. Oh my God my favourite
brother-in-law A, who I had known since 1983, was no longer with us. Life
seemed to stop but there and then but we had to rush and get ready to go to
León to join the family to mourn for him. Toño, Dolores and Olivia joined us
and it was a sad journey and a sad stop for a quick bite at Rueda. We didn’t
get to the Funeral Parlour in León till 15.30. Nearly all the family was there.
The wake was beautiful, with so many flowers and so many people and I know A
would have been impressed. I can’t write much about this out of respect for his
family but I have to add I had known him since we first met at our wedding in
August 1983 and that he quickly turned into my favourite brother-in-law. He was
vivacious, fun to be with, very good with his hands, a sporty type of person
who always dressed impeccably.  He was
the heart of the family celebrations always. I shall never forget him dressing
up as an old woman once in Montrondo and, basket in hand, pretended to be
begging. He was such fun and that’s how I want to remember him. I was his
comrade in arms when it came to family parties and also remember very well
going out with him to look for joke articles or fireworks for New Year’s Eve. I
also remember that often when we arrived from Madrid at his house that he would
take me out for wine and tapas while Eladio stayed with his sister. We had chemistry
and I shall miss him enormously. As couples, we were very close as were our
children and they often came to stay or we would stay at their house. One of
the last occasions was in 2011. In the photo of the 4 of us below we were out
to dinner in Madrid. I’m glad I have so many photos of him and our times
together. They are a consolation.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">He went too
early in life and he leaves a great big gap in the family.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">It was strange
to be in Montrondo in the middle of the week so unexpectedly. We had taken no
food, expecting to buy some in León. However, everything was closed as it was a
bank holiday. Thankfully the locals rallied round and provided us with eggs,
milk, bread and even a homemade pie. We had a lovely meal but it was so sad. </span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I woke up
early in Montrondo on Tuesday morning, the day of the funeral. It was not only
strange to be there but strange not to have Pippa. We had a quick breakfast and
left, mostly dressed in black as befitted the occasion. We drove straight to
the funeral parlour where I was privileged enough to be able to say goodbye to
A together with the immediate family. It was a moment of closure, but only
small closure. We walked to the church nearby and were all amazed to see just
how many people had come to pay their respects and say goodbye. You see the
family is well loved and A had many, friends. The funeral, as funerals go, was
very somber, perhaps too somber. At English funerals there would have been
speeches and of course a gathering afterwards for food and drink and the
occasion to celebrate the life of the person who has passed away. That is not
how it works in Catholic Spain. From the funeral we all drove to the cemetery
where my brother-in-law was to be buried in his family grave, in fact, together
with his Father who was also taken from life too early, in 1977, aged just 52.
I felt so sorry for his widower who is now over 90. At the cemetery I was taken
straight back to the burying of my own Mother in 1999 and of my brother in
2001. There is nothing so final as the coffin being lifted down and then the
hole in the ground being covered with cement. For me that was the worst moment
of the whole day. I kept a red rose from one of the reefs which had fallen on
the ground and shall keep it always as a keepsake; although a very sad
one.  Suddenly it was all over; just so
final. The family met for lunch at the restaurant opposite the funeral parlour.
<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It was very
ironic that the last time the family had been together was at his daughter’s
wedding and now we were all together for his funeral. It felt so odd and
strange that he was missing  family
gathering. Oh yes, he has left a huge gap in our lives. <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">However, we
were cheered up at the restaurant by the presence of the youngest member of the
family, Dylon Alexander, aged just 2 or 3 months and who had been born to
Alejandro and Carolina. I’m not very keen on babies, but this baby was lovely.
I should add, It behaved perfectly. Oli adores babies though and held it in her
arms for me to take lots of photos. This is one of her with the mother and
baby.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

left at 4.30 in cramped conditions in our Volvo. We were home by 7.50 and found
everything in order thanks to Lucy, our new and very capable home help and
carer. We went to bed early that night, tired both physically and emotionally.</span></div>

as it does and on Wednesday I woke up a bit later than usual, at 6.45. I had
breakfast with Astrid who I have to say was a delightful guest. I had lots of
things to do that day work wise and to get ready for my trip to London on
Thursday. I also had to do the weekly food shopping so that there were enough
provisions for the family while I was away. Oli was in trouble at work for
having taken 2 days off for her uncle’s funeral. It’s very unfair but there are
no official days free for the passing away of an uncle. But she didn’t care and
knew where her priorities lay and took the days from her holiday. That, of
course, got her into trouble. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

Thursday came, the day of my long awaited trip to London for Suzy’s 33<sup>rd</sup>
birthday. Oli would be joining us on Friday; although her trip was touch and go
until the last minute due to the demands of the programme she works for. She
will be starting her new job with Madrileños por el Mundo on 8<sup>th</sup>
May. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I weighed
myself that morning, rather worried I had put on weight as my diet had been
rather out of control the week before. But I had good luck when the scales
showed 55.6kg which meant it could go out of control in England too hahahah.
There is plenty of margin and I shall be back to the diet after the trip. No
way do I like diet when travelling. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It was to be
my first time with Ryan Air and travelling to Stansted Airport but everything
went smoothly. I even got 3 seats to myself after asking to change my middle
seat for an aisle seat. Thanks Ryan Air! At the airport I was about to get some
pounds out of a cash machine. But when I saw that it would cost 288 euros to
get 200 pounds, I decided against getting cash and would pay for everything by
visa. What a rip off! I got to Liverpool Street Station by 13.30 and ordered an
Uber cab which, for just 7 pounds, took me to Suzy’s place in Hackney. My
driver told me a black cab would have charged over 20 pounds. Oh I do like
Uber. Chati, Suzy’s flat mate, welcomed me into the flat and soon I was having
a cup of tea on the sofa chatting to her. Suzy wouldn’t be back till 5 and
after settling in I decided to go for a walk on the Canal (Regent’s Canal). <o:p></o:p></span></div>

Whilst we were hugging, Chati took photos of us. This is one I really like with

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Soon we were
out in the street again. We went off in Suzy’s little hired car, an Opel Corsa,
to buy food as her cupboards were practically bare. She took me to Tesco at
Whitechapel. I just love the variety of British supermarkets. We bought tons of
food, most of it healthy, except for a strawberry pavlova and raspberry meringue.
One look at them was enough to tempt me I’m afraid.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We had a super
dinner but as I had been up so early, before 5 in the morning, I was soon in
need of sleep. I slept in Anita’s big but lumpy bed – she was in Spain – and I
think I slept the night through. You see, I had some weed that night with the
girls. Are you shocked? You are supposed to be. I wouldn’t repeat the
experience though as it gave me a headache haha. <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Friday I
was awake at 5 in the morning and saw Chati who was also leaving for Spain. I
had a nice breakfast on my own. There was to be no special  birthday on Suzy’s birthday as she had to
leave early for work, her last day as a Band 5 locum dietitian with the North
Eastern NHS Trust. She will be starting as a Band 6 dietitian at the Ipswich
NHS hospital on 3<sup>rd</sup> May. But I did give her the main present we had
bought, a lovely blue HP PC which she is much in need of if she is to do
private consultations. If, by the way, you are interested, she can give
consultations via skype for any dieting needs at 50 pounds per consultation. I
know I’m her Mother but I can highly recommend her as it’s thanks to her I have
lost so much weight. <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">When she left,
with time on my hands until I was to meet Oli at Liverpool St. Station at 13h,
I got ready to go to Westfield Shopping Centre at Stratford. I took the
Underground at Haggerston (the girls’ nearest station), changed at Canonbury
and then took another train which got me to Stratford by 9.15. I didn’t realise
the shops didn’t open until 10 hahah. 
That gave me plenty of time to find my bearings and see where the shops
I wanted to go to where. These were them in order of priority: M+S, Lakeland,
Boots and Lindex. I had a field day at “Marks”. It was funny that everything I bought
was a size 10. So what did I get?  Lots
of skinny jeans, fleeces and wonderful bras; size 34B by the way hahaha.  Don’t think I’ve ever worn that size before.
It made me feel like a teenager.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">At 12.30h I
had to leave and took the Central Line to Liverpool St Station where I was to
meet Oli off the Stansted Express. She would be late though and I had to wait
an hour. Of great interest to me at the station was a statue of the “KIndertransport”.
This was to remember the thousands of Jewish children who fled from Nazi
Germany to refuge in England. Their gateway to safety was through Liverpool
Street. I had seen the statue before but it always interests me enormously as I
was brought up on WW2 stories at home.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We had a
dinner planned that night at a very famous Spanish restaurant called Cambio de
Tercio but first Suzy had to go to the goodbye party that Adam had arranged at
Shoreditch. So Oli and I slowly made our way to South Kensington where the
restaurant is, on Great Brompton Road. We were there early and enjoyed window
shopping. We also bought a carrot cake and lovely breakfast stuff from Paul,
that tempting French patisserie. As we walked along Great Brompton Road I
glanced at prices of houses and flats. I couldn’t believe it when I saw a
triplex flat going for 4.5 million pounds! Has the world gone crazy? It felt
crazy also to go past a Ferrari show room. What an area S. Kensington is. Of
course it’s Lady Diana land and full of rich foreigners. Before getting to the
restaurant, Oli and I stopped at a pub for a drink. We were drinking cider
throughout our stay. The pub only served normal apple cider but at the supermarkets
I was introduced to ciders made with different fruit. All 3 of us particularly
like the passion fruit Rekorderlig cider, made in Sweden. I do hope I can buy
it online in Spain. It’s so refreshing and of course has a lot less alcohol
than wine and it doesn’t give me headaches.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Soon the 3 of
us were sitting down to dinner. We did not order any wine as the cheapest
bottle was over 30 pounds and just one glass was 13 pounds which I thought was
another rip off and I told the Spanish waiters so. They agreed hahaha. Dinner
was good although very expensive. The worst thing though was the noise. I think
I have never been to a noisier restaurant in my life. It’s a great favourite
with Chati and her family but I’m not going back. The bill was hefty and the place
far too crowded. The restaurant wouldn’t let us take in the birthday cake for
Suzy so that’s another black point for them. We would have to wait to be in The
Cotswolds for that. Oli and I left with a headache, not from the wine but from
the noise! We walked back to the station and took the long tube ride back to
Whitechapel and Overground to Haggerston dying to “hit the sack” as it had been
such a long day. On the tube going home, we found out there had been 3 thwarted
terrorist attacks in London that day, including one near Westminster. Thank
goodness we would be getting away to the safety of The  Cotswolds the next day.</span></div>

the start of our full 4 day holiday together. I was up at 6, cleared the kitchen
decks and made a special birthday breakfast for Suzy. We left the flat at 10 am
and it would take us more than an hour to get out of London. We were going to a
hamlet called Woodmancote near Cirencester and would be staying at an Airbnb
place (<a href="http://www.stayatdemeter.com/">www.stayatdemeter.com</a>) for 2
nights where we would be hosted by a lovely retired man called Christopher and
his wife.  He had suggested the route to
take and we followed his instructions. We drove towards the West on the M4
towards Chippenham. From there we made our way to our first Cotswold village,
Lacock. It was a lovely place and like many other pretty villages in the area,
has been used for films and TV series. It was an introduction to unspoiled
countryside and picturesque villages that all could have been used for picture
post cards.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

village was to be what has been called “the prettiest village in England” and
it’s called Castle Combe and wow it was true. It was a sight for sore eyes.
Castle Combe has also been used in countless films and TV series, such as Pride
and Prejudice and, by the way, is in the county of Wiltshire.</span></div>

called The Annexe and was actually the granny flat Christopher built for his
Mother in their garden. The garden is not big and the flat, although rather
nice but rather cramped, is totally surrounded by a huge caravan and at least 2
cars, with not much garden leftover. The décor is a bit of a mix of old
fashioned and Ikea stuff. However it is a very comfortable and warm place and
has everything you need for a short stay. The big bonus was the fridge stocked
with enticing breakfast produce. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

had booked a table for dinner for us that night at a tempting gastro pub called
The Colesbourne Inn but as we were so full, we decided to cancel the booking.
We just could not take any more food hahah.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">From Stow we
drove to the one street town called Moreton in the Marsh and then back to Stow
to take the A424 road, the so called “5 mile drive” towards Evesham. Our
printed itinerary called it “one of the most beautiful roads in The Cotswolds
and it was. Our final destination was a village which Christopher told us was
his favourite, Chipping Campden. I think it’s mine too, although it’s difficult
to choose between Chipping Campden and Castle Combe. Here we saw the most
amazing thatched roofed houses and I just oohed and aahed away, making Suzy
laugh when I said I had to buy one and move in there and then. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">What a lovely
to place to live, I kept thinking. We explored the beautiful streets, went to
the “public convenience” – I do love English euphemisms hahaha and then decided
it was time for a walk. There were various to choose from, The Heart of England
Way, The Cotswolds Way and lots of public footpaths. We took the latter into
sheep fields and through delightful styles.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">There were
lots more places on our itinerary but we were tired, so after Chipping Campden,
we decided to drive “home”. I wanted Suzy to stop for me to take a photo of one
of the yellow fields I had fallen in love with. You can’t imagine just how
bright the colour of the rapeseed flowers was. Finally she did, just as we were
approaching Calmsden and I got my moment. I waded into the middle of the field
and the photo of that wonderful experience is the one I have chosen to illustrate
this week’s blog post. Oli took a video of me which is such fun and which you
can see <a href="https://youtu.be/9XiuNNtqF4w">here</a>. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

in our comfortable cottage by 6 and chilled out for the rest of the evening.
There was no cake but there was some delicious raspberry meringue we had bought
at Sainsburys which we had with fruit and yoghurt. Food glorious food hahhaa.</span></div>

visit the Cotswolds and it’s funny he never did as he spent most of his

at home today and opening the presents I got for him or enjoying the cake I
ordered. <o:p></o:p></span></div>
