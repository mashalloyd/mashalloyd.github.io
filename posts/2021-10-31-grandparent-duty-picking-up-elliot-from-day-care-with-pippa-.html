It is a coincidence we are both in yellow. I think we look good in yellow.</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">Good morning again friends and blog readers wherever this post finds you.  Last night the clocks went back and that always confuses and throws me. Autumn has really arrived and it has been wet this weekend. This weekend too is when the G20 are meeting in Rome. It is unbelievable to think that 20 countries represent 80% of the world's wealth. I find that obscene. But some good will come out of the summit. Yesterday it was reported that the 20 had come to an agreement which comes into force today. The obscenely rich multinational companies will now be forced to pay a global minimum tax whether they be but only of 15%. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Following the G20 summit will come the Climate summit in Glasgow called the COP26. Whether that with the noticed absence of China, one of the main culprits, will help the world fight climate change we can only hope and pray. But the main absentee there is the Queen of England who aged 95 has been advised by her doctors to take a rest from any face to face duties. Recently she had to cancel a trip to Northern Ireland and spent a night in hospital. We don't know what is wrong with her. I imagine it is frailty - early this month we saw her using a walking stick in public for the first time. I wish her well and dread the moment she dies. The whole country will go into mourning, myself included. She has been on the thrown throughout my life and I somehow cannot imagine Prince Charles taking her place. I hope she gets better soon. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">At the G20 summit, no doubt Boris Johnson will meet his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron. Right now there is an unprecedented fishing water rights battle between the two countries which are neighbours. The culprit is Brexit. It has something to do with the fact that post Brexit the UK had a commitment to issue a number of licences for French fishermen to fish in British waters but hadn't kept its promise. In retaliation the French overhauled a British fishing boat which had no licence. There have been strong words coming from the Elysee with threats of stopping British fishermen unloading at French ports and even stopping the supply of energy to the Channel Islands - those islands belonging to Britain but much nearer France. Hopefully this weekend Bojo and Macron can come to some agreement. The French are pretty cross at the moment and it all started with the Aukus alliance between the US, the UK and Australia against China's growing military assertiveness in the region. In the alliance the Australians would be supplied with nuclear submarines. So why is France cross about that? Well, because they had a deal with Australia to supply the latter with conventional submarines the Aussies no longer need. The deal was worth 50 billion dollars so no wonder Macron is fuming. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">The other big news this week affecting one of those obscenely rich corporate companies - Facebook which has a monopoly on social media - changed its group name to "Meta". That's because they want to concentrate on a new technology called Metaverse based on virtual reality and artificial intelligence - here is an explanation from Google: "a fully immersive online realm that looks similar to the real world but is computer generated". In the same way Google changed its group corporate name to Alphabet, Facebook this week announced the new brand "Meta". Like Google I doubt anyone will call it by its new corporate name.  As the Facebook app that name will stay the same. Some say this is  rebranding after all the troubles the company has been facing recently which have hit its reputation big time and which I wrote about recently. I really doubt this is going to help its reputation and although I use its apps, Instagram, Whatsapp and Facebook I do not admire this company which has the power to manipulate us all and do damage in many many ways. So, no I wasn't impressed by the news. "Meta", by the way, comes from the Greek word meaning "beyond". In Spanish, "meta" means the objective or finish line; so similar to "beyond". Some think that the metaverse which many companies are working on will be the next big thing after Internet. If it involves wearing virtual reality goggles then I won't like it. I once tried them and they gave me a headache. I did not like the experience. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgG4UCGLw-gYHakOn5hHiCGvA5hi6Z7mJ_kmZBuqE5QjOielPR_1ArHf8e-0h09MISpk_6hSk-8UUneP7BYeROesauq1zOpDxmoRpS7IQbPrJNKBnuA7l7lPJmaFhVpim7mZgg-yeVps_tY0_l0qKpxsYZk3vRkTCXV-JBGopdNydLG--N3ZgM=s640" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgG4UCGLw-gYHakOn5hHiCGvA5hi6Z7mJ_kmZBuqE5QjOielPR_1ArHf8e-0h09MISpk_6hSk-8UUneP7BYeROesauq1zOpDxmoRpS7IQbPrJNKBnuA7l7lPJmaFhVpim7mZgg-yeVps_tY0_l0qKpxsYZk3vRkTCXV-JBGopdNydLG--N3ZgM=w400-h225" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A change of name but not a change of company behaviour and it's all in the hands of one man; Mark Zuckerberg. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">None of this affected us as we were busy. I did, though, keep up with the news as much as I could - yes I am a news freak. This week we have been on grandparent duty as Miguel is back at work. We have been taking Elliot to school and picking him up everyday. That completely changed our normal routine but we don't mind as we love our little boy so much. We also had to help Oli out with the babies this weekend. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">But last Sunday was ours for the taking and we didn't do much, that's the truth. I was happy that morning that my father was slightly stronger and out of bed. He didn't have much for lunch and that worried me a bit as I don't think he is eating enough. When I had a video call with Suzy that day she advised me to give him purees including protein which we were doing. I tried that but he doesn't like them. I have to be vigilant as if he doesn't eat enough he will only get weaker. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Vigilant we should all be about Covid too as infections are on the rise as the weather gets colder. In Spain we are still having good weather. Last Sunday my Danish guests bathed in our pool. The pool, sadly, will be closing tomorrow until April next year.  But I can't complain as it has come to great use this year and is the main attraction for my Airbnb guests. So Covid is not yet really on the rise in Spain although there are signs it might be thanks to the new Delta Plus variant but it is in other parts of Western Europe, especially my home country, the UK, where the debate is still on about maintaining distances and compulsory mask wearing. I wish the government wouldn't dither as thousands more get the dreaded virus. Worldwide the number of those infected and those who have died has gone up from 244.142.267  and 4.959.711 to 247.165.025 and 5.010.984. So, yes, we have to be vigilant.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Sunday for us was very quiet with really nothing interesting to report. So let me move to Monday when our grandparent duty began. We were at Oli's place by 8.50 and all was peaceful. Little Juliet was fast asleep as usual.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgQdgmfDBwuJQlXGVcB7VXy3_D1c23rgP97dcGzJjMcCywtaAcXUFirdmeqzPKtV70HcHGRqZm6y6ttP0Kh3VlIjROL97dEYqzwQ-1F_nADtdsPujRqN5itGKEHwm5E_STER7Kj4NQ7WETm-K2Myv9pqLhsnkE5svgInEizBR8reeyykX7IZhs=s2642" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgQdgmfDBwuJQlXGVcB7VXy3_D1c23rgP97dcGzJjMcCywtaAcXUFirdmeqzPKtV70HcHGRqZm6y6ttP0Kh3VlIjROL97dEYqzwQ-1F_nADtdsPujRqN5itGKEHwm5E_STER7Kj4NQ7WETm-K2Myv9pqLhsnkE5svgInEizBR8reeyykX7IZhs=w180-h400" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Little Juliet</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Elliot had had his breakfast but was still a bit sleepy. I think he was surprised to see us. Eladio scooped him up into his arms and off we went into the cold of the morning. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEglQFU-sLooxu8T-5ku_pN5Il6Y6HfudXvugB1gHu1N3uCXZmk-SfSREQZ1Plhpv38IBkYQuoDhitA-l7uf963vRi8hFtY7txWsNoPh7KPN7i3GGSDWBjG-PHzcfNu_Ztm4A2iWgfY4ucOzPgI6PocclCan9vAI_9vKEBNIPfH6HX23xoXnpWg=s2642" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEglQFU-sLooxu8T-5ku_pN5Il6Y6HfudXvugB1gHu1N3uCXZmk-SfSREQZ1Plhpv38IBkYQuoDhitA-l7uf963vRi8hFtY7txWsNoPh7KPN7i3GGSDWBjG-PHzcfNu_Ztm4A2iWgfY4ucOzPgI6PocclCan9vAI_9vKEBNIPfH6HX23xoXnpWg=w180-h400" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Taking Elliot to school on Monday morning</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">He perked up when he looked into the sky and said "moon". All was well until we left him in the day care class. When he realised we were leaving he burst into tears and we felt like criminals. Poor little boy, he had expected more time with his beloved "Mazha" and "Booboo". It was too early for a coffee out so we turned back home. Eladio had some errands to do in town and I had to go to an all important medical appointment at the local public hospital, the state of the art Rey Juan Carlos. As a part of breast cancer awareness day, week or month (not sure) I had received a letter for a mammogram appointment. I usually go privately once a year and do the lot - mammogram, ultra sound and smear - but I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to go along. After all, my mother died of the dreaded breast cancer. I must say the hospital in Móstoles - a working class area on the outskirts of Madrid - is absolutely magnificent and in sharp contrast to the rather run down town of Móstoles. Maybe that has to do with it being privately run. Whatever it is, it is efficiently run and has marvelous installations - there are even gardens on every floor!</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjdV9sVHsQAY9yW4tfNIoa1FuvEWphVpHgb7rULCqLFufzikzsyxyefFWeyn__KvVPuAqzbpARbCckfvt_Kwa8F9e2P0di3cB1Fz5-jZ881QBedjXAgcor713PcQrmWiCWyvKNODrIO0_W8gK6Okdwrg7mR5NUeUCM2nQksvFxlxOoUbzKdzNc=s700" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjdV9sVHsQAY9yW4tfNIoa1FuvEWphVpHgb7rULCqLFufzikzsyxyefFWeyn__KvVPuAqzbpARbCckfvt_Kwa8F9e2P0di3cB1Fz5-jZ881QBedjXAgcor713PcQrmWiCWyvKNODrIO0_W8gK6Okdwrg7mR5NUeUCM2nQksvFxlxOoUbzKdzNc=w400-h240" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Monday saw me at this hospital for a mammogram</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I had an appointment at 11.45 and at 11.45 sharp I was called in. The whole procedure is short but if you are a woman you will know just how painful a mammogram is. Shortly afterwards I had the results in the form of a sort of x-ray on the Quirón Salud App - that is efficient. Not that I could interpret it.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We should have gone out shopping that morning - our cupboards were bare - but there was no time. There wasn't much time for a siesta either as I had to pick up Elliot at 4 pm. We decided later that Eladio would take him in the mornings and I would pick him up in the afternoons. I need more time in the mornings and Eladio needs his siesta. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Elliot was ecstatic to see me and to get into "Mazha car". We were soon at his home and as soon as we got through the front gate, he went running down to his house. We were both surprised his mother wasn't there. Instead, Suzy's friend Elenita was babysitting for Juliet while my daughter had gone swimming - she needs the exercise. I waited until she came home and left shortly as I had a scheduled skype call with my dear friend Amanda that afternoon.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The house was pretty empty. Our lovely Danish ladies had left and no more guests were coming until Thursday - 2 German guys (turned out to be Belgians) and I hardly saw Felipe, our permanent lodger, that day. It was great to chat to my friend for at least an hour. We don't do much but there is always plenty to talk about.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">By the time we had finished it was 7pm and I had an hour before dinner for my afternoon couch potato activity - watching TV. This week I finished Grey's Anatomy for the second time and thus started a series Oli gave me on a pen drive. It is a detective series called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_of_Easttown">Mare of Easttown</a>, starring a magnificent Kate Winslet. I binge watched it and finished it in less than a week. I highly recommend it. It reminded me a lot of Broadchurch, albeit an American version. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhEVj5g5pktiMOSCQyJR8x5SuwGXO2Mn3IpgpvsyGbqdq4BawoYyGG-OJLzrz2IBSnavmRmjzpPQruq9DXUUKkXa7Zrk_FSHhpjY7l5f9DHTsOMt4zoiIToPGsKF3ZK9nefNT2QRuxCetQpecXTvZWx6ftzzOHoIKKU1brJB-ij10c_ps9tPSc=s1200" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhEVj5g5pktiMOSCQyJR8x5SuwGXO2Mn3IpgpvsyGbqdq4BawoYyGG-OJLzrz2IBSnavmRmjzpPQruq9DXUUKkXa7Zrk_FSHhpjY7l5f9DHTsOMt4zoiIToPGsKF3ZK9nefNT2QRuxCetQpecXTvZWx6ftzzOHoIKKU1brJB-ij10c_ps9tPSc=w270-h400" width="270"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>If you like detective stories and Kate Winslet, this is a must watch TV mini series</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: center;"><i>which will have you guessing till the end. </i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Dinner was made of what I could find  - eggs with grilled "padrón peppers". I did not sleep too badly that night and was up at 6.40 or so on Tuesday morning. It was Eladio's turn to take Elliot so I could follow my leisurely morning routine. It wasn't that leisurely really as it involved preparing lunch - "fabada" - Asturian bean stew for the family. I would be having meat and veg as part of my diet. Yeah, it's going well. I also had to update my book keeping as I got another booking that day, this time for our house in Asturias in December. We can't wait to go ourselves again.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The day got hectic when Oli picked me up to accompany her and Juliet to 3 medical appointments. Unlike me who likes to go alone, Oli likes to have company. But I must say it was hectic with a lot of driving around and rushing to appointments. It wouldn't have been too bothered if I didn't have to do the shopping before lunch. I finally got to Mercadona at 1.30 where I had sent Eladio ahead with his easy list - the heavy things and stuff he won't get wrong (hahahaha). Thus we were home by 14h and although lunch was late we were still in our bedroom by 3 pm for the midday news. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I was off again to pick up Elliot at 4ish and decided to take Pippa along with me to surprise him. First he was surprised to see me when he saw me first standing outside the glass door to his classroom. He came rushing and banging on the door shouting "Masha, Masha, Masha". As soon as he was out I scooped him up into my arms and grabbed his satchel and coat from his teacher, "Itchy". Her real name is Itziar of Basque origin but is too difficult for the toddlers to pronounce so she has shortened it to Itchy. His next surprise was finding Pippa in the car. As soon as I fastened him in, our 6 year old mini chocolate smooth haired dachshund - our only dog left  - jumped onto his lap. He looked amused but was quite happy to see Pippa, saying "Hola Pippa". I keep trying to teach him "hello" but he mixes up his English and his Spanish at the moment while he tries to learn both languages.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgKLurFy7otSgEM-0ZcdySFsmiurZDKFPFDeGiTWZEO2OieWvdgjwbkr3AxvmKhnI55OnLu3uHdquTyn4tHOCBmMKHSyFadorGb-nkD5rOa5HJrLyxd2UevNP7n-vC5bb-tfl6MfSJV5hliVtQZwOPiBAxXSToXQ1zAAE9rvFIojAd7v8IXnLU=s2642" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgKLurFy7otSgEM-0ZcdySFsmiurZDKFPFDeGiTWZEO2OieWvdgjwbkr3AxvmKhnI55OnLu3uHdquTyn4tHOCBmMKHSyFadorGb-nkD5rOa5HJrLyxd2UevNP7n-vC5bb-tfl6MfSJV5hliVtQZwOPiBAxXSToXQ1zAAE9rvFIojAd7v8IXnLU=w180-h400" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Pippa surprised Elliot this week when I took her with me to pick him up from day care on Tuesday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We were soon at his home and I had to find a parking spot on his street - never easy. I got him out first and then Pippa, handing him her lead as I grabbed his school belongings. He looked so funny carrying her lead. It didn't last long as she pulls too hard for him, but long enough for me to take a photo which I knew would amuse the family.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg1ijw8F5cnNoQplVcvUQlrKB3lGQJlKmzmxisS4cQahQUo8SBS9Vl3kXLoeBNev6ZBKbHf3rjuiYsUI5hNhr53hP3tuEJWOuaICaqTnDAfZTqxCCrDy0q_8Hhpl82h0SSZIM4Zd_XnFGQ5uH9eq-P1eaIwCqTUD8xZoytbHV1kt5YdZqAZW_8=s2048" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg1ijw8F5cnNoQplVcvUQlrKB3lGQJlKmzmxisS4cQahQUo8SBS9Vl3kXLoeBNev6ZBKbHf3rjuiYsUI5hNhr53hP3tuEJWOuaICaqTnDAfZTqxCCrDy0q_8Hhpl82h0SSZIM4Zd_XnFGQ5uH9eq-P1eaIwCqTUD8xZoytbHV1kt5YdZqAZW_8=w242-h400" width="242"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Elliot and Pippa </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Both of them were happy to see Oli. I'm not that sure Elliot was pleased to see his sister - there is a little sibling rivalry here hahaha which is totally normal. He went from my arms to his mother's where he is at his happiest. From her arms he went straight to her breast while I held quiet little Juliet on Oli's brand new open out super comfortable sofa. I asked her whether she had ever had to feed them at the same time and she said yes a couple of times but she was fed up with it. No doubt she is but I find it charming. Breastfeeding is such an emotional act of love, I bet all mothers remember it as such but when you are going through it I suppose the feeling is not always the same. Obviously having two babies suckling at you can be a bit much. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I left shortly afterwards and came home to have my afternoon apple before settling in front of the TV in our room like a couch potato. That morning my friends I weighed myself 3 weeks after starting my diet. The figure on the scales was lower than I thought but obviously not low enough so my diet will continue. I calculated I have put on a whole stone (about 6 kilos) since the pandemic began in March 2020 so not too bad. The scales inspired me to continue my diet. When I have the will power I am very very motivated and when I don't not I am not. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Having done the shopping that day there was loads of choice for dinner and I chose the healthy option of tuna fish salad. We watched the news again - the volcano, the rise of electricity, a ruffle between the parties of the Spanish coalition government on labour reforms, etc, etc. What we were watching about the government at lunch that day had been filmed by Miguel as his first day out with the camera. He spent the morning at the government HQ called "La Moncloa" in Spain. What a fascinating job he has I think. So does Oli.  No doubt the two will be working together when Oli returns to her reporter job with the TVE morning programme. That is how they met, at work. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I had a good night's sleep with only a small coughing incident which I quickly dispensed with thanks to my magical codeine tablets. I was awake, late for me, at 7.15 am. The first thing I saw on my phone over my early morning coffee - first things first - was another reservation, the second this week. This time it was for this weekend.  A solo traveler, Iban, was coming here the next day for 3 nights. He would coincide with my overseas guests who arrived on Thursday too. That means it's full house this weekend. When they all go tomorrow I have a solo Dutch guest staying here for 5 nights. He apparently wants to see the museums of Madrid. Good, I like cultural visitors. On Friday too a family of 6 arrived at El Cuetu. This weekend is a bank holiday as tomorrow 1st November is All Saints' Day. It is now becoming referred to as the Halloween bank holiday, something I loathe. Why on earth do we all have to adopt American traditions? Next we will be celebrating Thanksgiving, but not me. I refuse to celebrate Halloween. It's not something I was brought up on - rather Bonfire Night/Guy Fawkes Night or Plot as it is called in Yorkshire - so I have always been against it.  I hope you don't mind my posting the photo below I found on a friend's feed.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhucU41lqzJfNQlKpyk5VwX4P8U6c3Krs6i16J-nXibi0YugbnpT_hutjgjy5HrsDeniu2A0ZTSIWb14_tOCwwA4i9u9HHEBCWTYIutVmgEjJdhRS_A6IwOOwhIyz6qDFCL1P5qf893BBy8HtF7Q-nu10Cmme41ifThSn_42mE9cCymb1VLEtc=s1097" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhucU41lqzJfNQlKpyk5VwX4P8U6c3Krs6i16J-nXibi0YugbnpT_hutjgjy5HrsDeniu2A0ZTSIWb14_tOCwwA4i9u9HHEBCWTYIutVmgEjJdhRS_A6IwOOwhIyz6qDFCL1P5qf893BBy8HtF7Q-nu10Cmme41ifThSn_42mE9cCymb1VLEtc=w389-h400" width="389"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Totally against this pagan tradition that comes from across the Atlantic Sea. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;">I used to hate it when I had to dress up the girls in outfits for the occasion at school. That's because I'm no good at sewing and in those days there was no online shopping and nowhere to buy outfits.  Thankfully I had a neighbour, a mother of the girls' friend, Beatriz who made two witch outfits for them. God bless Inés. I shall never forget her kindness. I think the girls wore them for years but always protested their outfits were not good enough to compete in the Halloween competition (ouch - that's something they have never forgotten). Today it is much easier. Elliot's other grandmother, Merche, bought him an off the hanger devil outfit. We all wondered whether he would want to put it on. It turned out he didn't mind at all. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Eladio was off early to take him to school and I had time for book keeping and other household tasks. We both went for our walk - mine is the shorter version owing to the water on my knee. Just as I was returning, Lucy rang to say the police were at our house. The police you might ask? Whatever for? Well, I knew why. They were coming to see my father so that we could renew the disability badge for our car - not that we take him out that much as he is not at all mobile. They wanted him to sign two forms which was not at all easy. He no longer has enough pressure in his hand for the ink to reach the paper. In the end they decided I could sign to stop his suffering. Meanwhile I showed them the biography I had written for my father's 100th birthday. They were very impressed that they had met a Second World War veteran and said that it had been a privilege. I like the police here in Spain. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEipnDXymbbBhe5DRlR-7SeKzll8InUhLHUQqYiZ3H2zbXSVZ0QOy2BhSgfhXRXfEUO-7xZ26i2n7vu0cB_RCw115Dhro-jYYQMUqxcG4zSgkK6895CBxMheWFuloxfoVO2MblE24tOEkDiv4NKEZqkalVY_gZoQheY0_qcEQrhm0c_3leNb5Sk=s2642" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEipnDXymbbBhe5DRlR-7SeKzll8InUhLHUQqYiZ3H2zbXSVZ0QOy2BhSgfhXRXfEUO-7xZ26i2n7vu0cB_RCw115Dhro-jYYQMUqxcG4zSgkK6895CBxMheWFuloxfoVO2MblE24tOEkDiv4NKEZqkalVY_gZoQheY0_qcEQrhm0c_3leNb5Sk=w400-h180" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The police car outside our house on Wednesday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Not much else happened that day. As usual at 4.15 or so I went off to pick up little Elliot. He was ecstatic to see me again and I was happy to be the one to pick him up. We were home soon as his house is so near his school. I played with him for a while and also enjoyed holding little Juliet. She really is the original sleeping  beauty.

We hoped to take Elliot to a "farm school" nearby but it all would depend on the weather as rain was forecast for this weekend. In the end it poured it down and we had to resort to a Plan B. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I cut short my stay as I had a Facetime call scheduled with my dear friends Kathy and Phil who live in Keighley in West Yorkshire. Over a cuppa and sitting on the bench outside the kitchen we had a good old natter, catching up on our lives. Kathy nearly tempted me to visit England in December for a St. Joseph's College reunion dinner. I would love to go but will leave it till later next year when the weather is better and Eladio can come with me.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">That day I finished Mare of Easttown -a  marvellous series - and then continued with a new hospital series called Chicago Med. It's not as good as Grey's Anatomy or maybe I haven't got into the characters yet. What  a sucker I am for hospital series.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Dinner was light and were in bed soon watching the news. The top news for nearly a month now has been the volcano in La Palma. We have no idea how long it will last and so far it has destroyed over 2000 houses and displaced 7000 people. Now that is a tragedy.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">Thursday came, the day of the arrival of my new guests and everything had to be perfect. It did not turn out to be a perfect day. It was rather topsy turvy in many ways. My first guest arrived at about 10 am, earlier than expected. Iban wanted to leave his suitcase here and check in later but as his room was ready I gave him the key and a tour of the house. It turns out he works for a Basque restaurant group which was opening a new restaurant this weekend in Boadilla called <a href="https://perretxico.es/">Perretxico</a>. It specialises in pintxos/tapas and other typical food from the north. He even invited us to the opening night that evening but we declined as we not that social these days. We promised, however, to book a table for our Friday dinner out at the new restaurant. He said he would come back later in the afternoon for a shower before the party and would be bringing another guest for just one night.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was only then I could have a shower - I didn't know I wouldn't be able to the next day - after his arrival and my book keeping session that morning. Eladio did the all important job of turning on the central heating for the first time since May. Traditionally in Madrid the heating goes off on 1st May and comes back on 1st November. It was still warm with the temperature reaching 21c but not so in the early morning or evenings. He had to check each and every one of the radiators in the whole house; getting rid of the air there might be. I didn't want my new guests to be cold. I didn't want to be cold either. I don't think you can imagine what it costs to keep this house warm - with 650m of building including 7 bedrooms and 9 bathrooms. As to electricity, with the costs rising, I dread to think what this month's bill will be. Eladio says it will have gone up by 50%!!!</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">My other guests - two guys from Germany who turned out to be a very recently retired married couple from Belgium - weren't arriving until 5.30 and in between time I had to go and pick up Elliot from daycare. As usual he was delighted to see me. Once home he and Juliet fought over their mother's breast for her milk. He was suckling away and Juliet was crying (unusual) which meant she was really hungry. When I handed Juliet to Oli and she tried to take Elliot away, he wasn't having it and used the non verbal sign of waving his index finger to say no. We had to coax him away but putting on "Fireman Sam" on Netflix. I found it hysterical. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I then had to rush home to receive Luc and Dominque. They arrived at about 6 having driven all the way through France via the San Sebastian border. With their car they had a huge trailer, the same size as their car and had especially chosen our house to park their vehicles. Just as they were arriving my Basque guests did too. When I thought everyone was settled, the Spanish guests told me there was no water. They had come straight from the restaurant to have a shower and get ready to go their opening event. Oh my God that was the bad moment of the day. All this was happening while the Belgium guests were figuring out how to remove the trailer from the car and park it in the garage. It was bedlam and the barking of our neighbours' rather unfriendly refuge dog did not make matters easier. I had come out without shoes or slippers and after ringing our neighbours to find out if they had had their water cut off too, I marched in my socks to the next house as the former were not in. I then went into our neighbours' house when they were back where I was a bit attacked by their dog so I went out into the street again. What a moment. It soon materialised that there had been a huge leak up the road and and the water had been cut off in all the surrounding streets, I didn't know what to say to my guests, especially the two guys who had come back specifically for a shower. I rang the security guards who didn't know much. So after dinner I drove to the point in the street where the leak was to find out for myself what was happening. I found a huge crane with about 5 workers trying to find the source of the leak. They told me they would work until late but doubted water would be restored until the next day. Damn it. That is the second time in 4 or 5 months that this has happened but not for such a long period.  My Belgium guests were very sweet about it as was Felipe, our semi permanent lodger. It was very bad luck.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiE8Wrr8DGMyU2SCPK9k3pPjIywCowbomwWcYL7WbBBEbwmdoHlxgWcQ1pq2zYW6OmynygpyTaTQ5OPOHevhAluuY-nXh8TjEDD0KIqgMy9pp0ugEqRiw3rcQhpyVaJO9UJ4vFCZX9FmYxBe-ReMtfWDemBYdt7uuAk1yGDk_uMa-bgSJXmkMc=s1440" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiE8Wrr8DGMyU2SCPK9k3pPjIywCowbomwWcYL7WbBBEbwmdoHlxgWcQ1pq2zYW6OmynygpyTaTQ5OPOHevhAluuY-nXh8TjEDD0KIqgMy9pp0ugEqRiw3rcQhpyVaJO9UJ4vFCZX9FmYxBe-ReMtfWDemBYdt7uuAk1yGDk_uMa-bgSJXmkMc=w300-h400" width="300"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The leak on Thursday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Thankfully there were quite a few bottles of water around the house which were useful for minimum hygiene.

That morning I perked up as I had a coffee date with my friend and ex Nokia colleague, Juana, who, owing to the Pandemic, I hadn't seen in 2 years!!!! It was the occasion to make the effort, dress up and put make up on. The only down point is that I couldn't have a shower and had to use a flannel with mineral water for my ablutions. I haven't dressed up  for a while, apart from dinner with my Spanish family last week. We are living in this little bubble thanks to Covid and my social life has got smaller and smaller. I went into my walk in wardrobe and I had  a pick of dresses to choose from which I hadn't worn for ages. Owing to the stone I have put on because of Covid, my choice was slightly limited. I chose a colourful dress I had bought in Llanes last September and which I think I have only worn once. With it I put on a shocking pink scarf and even heels (very low of course). It was quite a unique moment and I got Eladio to take a photo. It came out well, possibly because I was feeling so good.

She was young and single then. A few years later she fell in love with a colleague, Oscar when they both worked for our mutual friend Julio. Oscar was posted to Mexico and that's where they formed their family and where their children Santi and Patri were born. They came back to Spain about 10 or so years ago. Oscar still works for Nokia - he is the longest lasting employee that I know there - and Juana works for Microsoft. She has been offered a senior post in New York - the city of her dreams and the family will be moving in a couple of months. All I could say was "olé" for this young Spanish woman engineer who will have under her a whole team of US workers as her staff. It's a wonderful opportunity for Juana and her family. In a way she reminds me of when I was at her stage in life. We nearly went to live in London but my Spanish boss at Motorola boycotted the move. Then I could have got a post with Nokia either in the US or UK but couldn't move as by then my father had come to live with us. Juana is living my dream and I am happy for her and also very proud. We had loads to talk about and vowed to see each other again before they move. Who knows, maybe we shall be able to go out and visit them. I would love that as Eladio and I have only been to the Big Apple once and that was about 10 years ago. <div><br></br></div><div>We parted when it was raining and when I got to my car I spied a branch of Sánchez Romero - Spain's most luxurious supermarket. There and then I decided to go in and get some ready made food for lunch as I was sick of leftovers. There were English and American people buying food and I could only conclude they were well paid expat executives. Only the rich can afford to do their daily shopping at Sánchez Romero. It is a well known fact that that is where the Real Madrid football players buy their food. I wish I could too but I can go in on occasion and feel spoiled for choice. If I hadn't been on a diet I would have bought some of their sweet stuff - what a range - but came out with only meat and  veg.</div><div><br></br></div><div>From there I had to drive to a poundland like store. These are run by the Chinese in Spain and the shops are called "los chinos". Oli needed me to get some ghastly Halloween decorations to put on their windows so the children in the complex know where to go for "trick and treat". There was not much on offer but I bought what I could.</div><div><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">By then it was 13h and I decided to stop by the water leak breakdown place near our house before returning home to find out for myself when the supply would be restored.

They told me they hoped the supply of water would be restored by 16h- that would be 23 hours without water. <div><br></br></div><div>At home Lucy was doing her best without water. She was relieved to see me with food provisions which didn't require water or cooking. Lunch was a problem for my father who is now refusing to eat - he only seems to want liquid which is a huge challenge. It worries me. I wrote to his doctor who will do a full check on him on Tuesday - tomorrow is a bank holiday - </div><div><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">When the water came back at 16 h it was a hallelujah moment and I would have loved a shower but I had to go and pick up Elliot from day care. It was raining and cold and I didn't realise the soles of my Camper black suede boots were broken so I got soaked. I tried to keep Elliot dry under my umbrella when we walked from a far away street from his house as there was nowhere else to park. He arrived dry while  I was soaking. It was good to be in Oli's dry and warm flat and to hold Juliet and have some fruit with Elliot as he watched Fireman Sam (his latest passion). He nearly ate half a big tub of bilberries;  he loves them so. I left as Miguel arrived and got wet again. Once home and in my bedroom I had the great idea of taking a jacuzzi, something I haven't done for years. A lot of people think a jacuzzi is the height of luxury but when you have one you hardly use it. But I did on Friday and it did me the world of good. I then changed into warm and comfortable clothing - the sort of lounge wear I am so accustomed to now hahahaha. We went out again as we had booked a table at Perritxico, the restaurant our guest, Iban, was helping set up. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We got a lovely welcome and we liked the place. It is made to look like a typical Basque tavern with a modern touch. They serve the traditional "pintxos" -  Basque type tapas which looked enticing. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiM67V7Qn6iQKDo4s00kei76c9tv-f6rUsKpKD6IXoxov4WRx-0xBtA1-zo2CRsJTHHQ9chNl7u54n5kZHECTbzpoX0jik3QO6qbOCgeqcUzPTQqxAxEGybuSG42v2il5u6FsclaOAJeBHfFEsPS7IZZkRoFTWbRyihBw-Lm7eKpwV4Q1EnSyU=s2642" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiM67V7Qn6iQKDo4s00kei76c9tv-f6rUsKpKD6IXoxov4WRx-0xBtA1-zo2CRsJTHHQ9chNl7u54n5kZHECTbzpoX0jik3QO6qbOCgeqcUzPTQqxAxEGybuSG42v2il5u6FsclaOAJeBHfFEsPS7IZZkRoFTWbRyihBw-Lm7eKpwV4Q1EnSyU=w400-h180" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio looking at the pintxos on Friday at Perritxico </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Eladio went for fish and I went for meat which we had with a glass of "Txacoli" - a slightly sparkling light white wine from the Basque region. I have to say that of all the different food regions in Spain, the Basque cuisine is the best. People come from places as far away as Australia to dine at Michelin star restaurants like Arzac in San Sebastian. I once took Eladio there but he wasn't impressed. I was. So, yeah we were impressed with our dining experience on Friday night and will be recommending Perritxico to all our guests from now on. When we asked for the bill, our guest, Iban, came to say it was on the house. That was so unexpected and  kind, especially because of the lack of water incident. Thank you Iban we much appreciate that.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">I felt more relaxed that night although I woke up with a headache thanks to the wine - my treat of the week. The house was quiet and dark and it was raining outside. I wondered what we would do that day for grandparent duty with Oli and the grandchildren as Miguel was working. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Off we went at about 11 am and helped Oli get the kids cleaned and dressed - it's so funny to be changing nappies again. In the end we decided to have lunch out and then go to a shopping centre to be indoors and where there are remote controlled mini cars for children to drive. That was our Plan B when we couldn't go to the kids' farm or zoo because of the weather. It actually didn't rain much but the day was definitely autumnal. I admired our garden just before we left and had to have a photo to show you. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjWnJhObYDa3khrxTXGfGNpcvDTGZBjxF3k7KrxPBvLYFtXPhKJVfz5jqZCD3uvXvjPP3pxAfz-aetMgtyTXAX1dr5hQAfpyB4RxjWxPblW3R5SBbzxz_LVCDQE3ijqU9BzqfaBlG5xOjsihrxcP2jItgMChmxqAia2JKBixz5RlmBfVW45icA=s2642" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjWnJhObYDa3khrxTXGfGNpcvDTGZBjxF3k7KrxPBvLYFtXPhKJVfz5jqZCD3uvXvjPP3pxAfz-aetMgtyTXAX1dr5hQAfpyB4RxjWxPblW3R5SBbzxz_LVCDQE3ijqU9BzqfaBlG5xOjsihrxcP2jItgMChmxqAia2JKBixz5RlmBfVW45icA=w400-h180" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our Mediterranean garden in its autumn colours<br></br><br></br></i></td></tr></tbody></table>It was purely coincidental but both Eladio and I were wearing yellow; great autumn colours too. It was Oli who took this week's feature photo of us both pushing our grandchildren's pram and push chair while they slept. We were walking around the streets of Boadilla, making time before our 1.30 reservation at an Indian restaurant where Oli had booked a table for us. Miguel was able to join us but had to go straight back to work afterwards. With the children sleeping we could enjoy a spectacular Indian lunch at the Spanish named restaurant "Mar y Montaña". I had to break my diet but it didn't matter. What was strange though was that my appetite has been reduced and there was far too much food. That night I only had fruit for dinner and Eladio didn't want anything at all. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We all love curries and they had our favourites on the menu: onion bhaji, somozas, chicken tikka masala and lamb korma. We had the latter with naans and pilaf rice. I knew my dear friend Sandra who was born and brought up in India would have loved this meal.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgQWxebeOZXJLHuO3ceM-UycBWEvuEeajS9YMUJ7MBZzPET0wO-JJKS5oVglDEKhLyv2hfh2diAm2rpUsqYSZ4n-ybesHmOpHybRdUy6SQTHTj3yzgJBr8KzrXgkx3eAf2xrwJfzAlKVWpBE9WtUyGyosX6IK2P3Wyj6oo7T15FGQ5t2BSuLJc=s2642" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgQWxebeOZXJLHuO3ceM-UycBWEvuEeajS9YMUJ7MBZzPET0wO-JJKS5oVglDEKhLyv2hfh2diAm2rpUsqYSZ4n-ybesHmOpHybRdUy6SQTHTj3yzgJBr8KzrXgkx3eAf2xrwJfzAlKVWpBE9WtUyGyosX6IK2P3Wyj6oo7T15FGQ5t2BSuLJc=w400-h180" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Wonderful Indian food at Mar y Montaña on Saturday for lunch yesterday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Oli and Miguel ordered the pistachio Indian ice cream which I usually love. Indian ice cream is mainly made of condensed milk but these days I find it far too heavy.<div><br></br></div><div>After lunch we let Eladio go home for his siesta and took the grandchildren to a big shopping centre, Gran Plaza in Majadahonda, the main idea being for Elliot to "drive" one of the min electric cars. He loved the experience and chose a BMW X6 - that was the car I had in its adult version when I worked for Yoigo (oh how I miss it). He had a ball of a time and  I loved watching him. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-7QYzmVDsA">Here is a video </a>I took to remember the occasion. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiP_audR1q7X1iZDlMuJ2C5x_EU7ARgp8QXQVQVfw5LJYwytwFvwCVmmcdTaUAfJFZfgronWhmvHXhls-VSgGSmoEvR9vmtepsDBw2RhTDcTGL2bQ6AFr0rb10EUapJ3KasVW_r0g--unofawafATahnQSXdEGMNq0QHY144_p891eCxNdKZ9c=s2642" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiP_audR1q7X1iZDlMuJ2C5x_EU7ARgp8QXQVQVfw5LJYwytwFvwCVmmcdTaUAfJFZfgronWhmvHXhls-VSgGSmoEvR9vmtepsDBw2RhTDcTGL2bQ6AFr0rb10EUapJ3KasVW_r0g--unofawafATahnQSXdEGMNq0QHY144_p891eCxNdKZ9c=w295-h400" width="295"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Elliot in his mini BMW</i></td></tr></tbody></table>While he "drove" I went into the Phone House shop to get an adapter (a jack) to be able to insert my headphones. Very annoyingly the Samsung 20 comes without the jack (hole for for headphones). I got one for Oli too. <div><br></br></div><div>Before heading home and in order to extend our time out with the kids, Oli suggested ice cream. Elliot adores "i cream" and we headed to Haagen Dazs - a made up word by the way.

We were shattered after a day of grandparent duty.

I slept fitfully and every time I woke up I checked the time on my phone. In the end I got up at 7 which of course was 8 yesterday. I had the kitchen to myself with Pippa until Iban, my restaurant guest, came in to say goodbye. I persuaded him to have a coffee before driving back to his home town of Vitoria. He was the perfect guest and he told me he would be back soon. He will be very welcome.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Today we are on grandparent duty again and have to figure out what to do with the babies today.
