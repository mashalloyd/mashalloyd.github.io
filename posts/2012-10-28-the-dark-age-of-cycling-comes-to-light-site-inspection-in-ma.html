<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Hi again this sunny
but cold last Sunday in October.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I hope your
week was good. Mine was much dominated with stories of cycling after the
aftermath of the USADA report accusing Lance Armstrong of doping. This week I
read David Walsh’s book From Lance to Landis where I read a lot about how he
cheated his way to win the Tour of France and also discovered the stories of
his team mates, many of whom I knew from the Motorola Cycling Days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>On Monday the UCI, also accused of
corruption, acknowledged the findings of the USADA report when Pat McQuaid, its
controversial head, said that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/cycling/lancearmstrong/9625080/UCI-Lance-Armstrong-has-no-place-in-cycling.html">Lance Armstrong had no place in cycling</a> and thus
finally stripped him of his 7 Tour de France wins. Not so long afterwards the
Texan removed this description from his now very silent Twitter account.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Wednesday
the <a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/2013-tour-de-france-route-presented-in-paris">Tour de France presented its 2013 edition</a> which will celebrate its
centenary but most of that event was clouded by the Armstrong scandal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>At the presentation, Alberto Contador, the
Spanish cycling champion, also under suspicion, spoke out in favour of Lance,
as did Miguel Indurain later, the 5 times winner of the Boucle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>When I hear cyclists like them supporting
Lance Armstrong when the evidence is there that he cheated, it makes me think
they don’t want to acknowledge the truth as they themselves may well be tainted
in the process. Meanwhile the British team Sky, in an attempt to clean up the
sport, announced they would ask all the team members, including the staff, if
they had been involved in doping and if they had they would have to leave the
team but would be paid “umbrella money”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>If they didn’t own up and it was later found out that they had been
involved in doping, they would then not be paid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Bradley Wiggins is the Sky Team’s leader and
the first Brit to win the Tour and it is widely acknowledged he did so in a
clean way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The manager David Brailsford
is on a mission to clean the sport and his starting point is the Sky Team.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>On Thursday another ex Motorola rider, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/cycling/9633895/Lance-Armstrongs-former-team-mate-Bobby-Julich-leaves-Team-Sky-after-admitting-to-doping-past.html">BobbyJulich, Sky’s race coach, admitted to doping and quit the team</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That left me thinking about Sean Yates, Sky’s
Senior Sports Director, an ex British cyclist who had also formed part of the
Motorola Cycling Team and was very much Lance’s mentor at the beginning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Sean was a domestique but he did once wear
the Yellow Jersey at the Tour de France in 1994, even if only for one day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was at that Tour de France and was given a
wonderful signed photograph of Sean with the yellow jersey and Lance with the
rainbow jersey for having won the 1993 road racing world championship just
ahead of Miguel Indurain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He was just 21
at the time, very brash but quite a nice kid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I could never imagine when I was given that photograph what would happen
20 years later</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The photograph
was taken by Graham Watson, the best professional photographer in the trade who
I am sure must be even more shocked than I am at this week’s news.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I looked at his Twitter account and his only
tweet recently was “ouch”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Many other
people I knew through my experience with the team seem to have remained pretty
silent this week but I’m sure they must be as shocked as I.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I refer to people like Paul Sherwen (ex PR
Manager for the Motorola cycling team and now a TV commentator and very close
to Lance) or Rupert Guinness, the Australian cycling journalist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Others like Johan Bruyneel will probably be
silent as they are equally guilty as Lance Armstrong.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">And finally
today I read that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/cycling/9638483/Sean-Yates-loses-job-at-Team-Sky-as-Dave-Brailsfords-doping-cull-continues.html">Sean Yates also quitted the Sky Team</a> after admitting that he
too had been involved in doping.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So wow
another Motorola cycling team member admitted to doping.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I wonder if anyone of them road clean. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I was confused to read just a few hours later on
The BBC website that he had left because he wanted to retire and not because of
having doped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I wonder what the truth
really is or if you can ever know the real truth in this sport.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Meanwhile on
Friday <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/cycling/tour-de-france/9636620/Lance-Armstrongs-Tour-de-France-years-are-cast-into-the-dark-ages-of-cycling-by-UCI.html">the UCI announced that Lance Armstrong’s 7 Tours would not be allocatedto anyone</a>, leaving the years from 1999 to 2005 blank.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They said they decided not to upgrade any
other competitors, due to the widespread doping in the peloton at the
time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Those years are now considered the
dark age of cycling which this week has finally come to light.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I am still in shock and so disappointed at
the sport I always loved and became so involved in thanks to my job with
Motorola in the 90’s. I can only hope that David Brailsford’s mission is a
success but I have my doubts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Let’s see
how many more cyclists come clean in the following weeks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>My mind strays constantly to Miguel Indurain
the Spanish cycling legend but also to what must be going on in Lance
Armstrong’s head and whether he has any regrets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But only he will know and for the moment he
is silent although, knowing him, probably raging inside.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">My week wasn’t
only about cycling. Monday saw me in the office for an interview with my new
boss by the top financial daily in Spain Expansión.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I have yet to see the article which will
probably come out tomorrow Monday.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Tuesday saw me
in Madrid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I went into town to site
inspect venues for the Yoigo Christmas activities. I was accompanied by Bea,
Gloria and Miguel from my events agency QuintaEsencia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We met at the <a href="http://museodeltraje.mcu.es/">Costume Museum</a> first on a
glorious sunny day where we had a coffee and planned the morning’s visits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had been there before but knew before we
left we wouldn’t be considering it for our Christmas party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Our next venue was the sky scraper building
<a href="http://www.torreespacio.es/">Torre Espacio</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We took the lift in this
very security conscious building to the top floor, number 42 from where you
have great views of Madrid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It is
nowhere near as tall as any big American sky scrapers but is one of the tallest
buildings Madrid has to offer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I felt
rather shut in as I often do in tall buildings, but could not help but admire
the view outside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Again I knew I
didn’t want this venue for our Christmas party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I was looking for something much more special or unique.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Our next stop
was the new Spanish college of architects’ headquarters, the <a href="http://www.coam.org/pls/portal/coam_portada.web.inicio">COAM</a>, a modern
building in the heart of Madrid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was
very suitable for the party so we haven’t ruled it out yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Then we went
to a brand new location in Madrid, the swish new <a href="http://isabelastore.com/es/">Isabela gourmet market</a> in
Paseo de la Habana, not far from the Bernabeu Stadium.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This place is really something special and
has risen to the top of the list of possibilities for the final choice. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Our last stop
of the morning was at the very fashionable and up market restaurant called <a href="http://www.restaurantetenconten.com/">Ten con Ten</a>, another possible location for our party and where we were also going
to have lunch. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I fell in love with the
place but soon realised it was rather too small.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Later we learned they wouldn’t hire it out so
it came off our list.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However it was a
great discovery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It’s the place where
many of Madrid’s “beautiful people” come and as I Iooked at the posh and well
dressed people eating here I wasn’t sure I really felt at home.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Afterwards we
went to have a cup of coffee at another fashionable location, with a view for
using it at an up and coming press event I have to organize.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was intrigued to hear it was called
“Whitby”, after the seaside town in North Yorkshire I so love but was
disappointed to see no resemblance or relationship with its English
counterpart, other than the name.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The next topic
in this week’s headline is the <a href="http://www.britishlegion.org.uk/support-us/">Poppy Appeal</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>You will wonder why I am including that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Well I was inspired by our visit to the sky scraper Torre Espacio which
happens to house the British Embassy in Madrid and here at the reception desk
on the ground floor I saw they were selling the English poppies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I have only ever bought one in England so was
delighted to see them on Tuesday morning.</span></div>

the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_poppy">Poppy appeal</a> is probably England’s most famous charity appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The paper poppies people buy and wear in
October and November are in remembrance of the Armistice on 11th
November after the First World War and proceeds go to the Armed Forces in
general.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I looked up why the red flower
is a symbol and learned that it comes from the poem “In Flanders Field” by the
Canadian<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Lieutenant Colonel and
physician John McCrae.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On a totally
different topic, on Wednesday I was astonished to hear on the news that the famous
London landmark, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiralty_Arch">Admiralty Arch </a>between The Mall and Trafalgar Square, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/oct/24/admiralty-arch-sold-luxury-hotel?newsfeed=true">was to be sold</a> for a 90 year lease to a Spanish developer Rafael Serrano.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This rich Spaniard will be turning the
landmark built in 1912 by King Edward VII in memory of his Mother, Queen
Victoria into a luxury hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I wonder
how many crisis struck Spaniards could even dream of staying there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The selling price was some 60 million pounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Apparently it costs the British Government 1
million pounds a year to keep up this decaying building, so they will now make
a profit over the next 90 years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
wonder if Edward VII is turning in his grave at the news.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Wednesday
evening Eladio and I enjoyed another episode of Gran Hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was thus interested to read later that the
series, dubbed “<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/downton-abbey/9630450/Spanish-Downton-Abbey-to-debut-in-UK-next-month.html">The Spanish Downtown Abbey”</a> will be shown on TV in the UK later
this year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I read this on The Daily
Telegraph’s online site. I then looked at some of the comments and was upset to
see a reader comment: “</span><span style="color: #262626; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">A show about a Spanish hotel? Will they
have finished building it yet?”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I thought
the comment was not only disparaging but also prejudiced but then again that is
the image Spain sometimes has abroad and which it has often brought upon
itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In any case I hope English viewers
enjoy the series which is very well done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>However I suspect they will not be too happy with the script writing which
I think is not a patch on script writing of English series.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

one day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You will have seen the picture
of her dressed as a bride above and I bet you are wondering what this all about
and whether she got married.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>No, no, it
wasn’t that, not yet at least.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>On Friday
she was asked to report on a wedding exhibition taking place in Madrid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She decided to do the live report dressed in
one of the gowns being exhibited and of course looked stunning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She commented later that all the dresses were
tiny, being model sizes and could only find one that fitted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Olivia is quite thin so that does say
something about models’ sizes at fashion shows, I must say.</span></div>

quiet day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We were joined by Oli for
lunch and went for our walk in the afternoon, once again with the three
dogs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In the evening we decided to go
the cinema as we wanted to see the new film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/">Argo</a> and Oli did too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was well worth it and one of the best
films I have seen in a long time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  Directed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck">Ben Affleck</a> who is also the main character, </span>the story
is true and amazing and is about the rescue of the 6 American Embassy staff who
escaped just as the Embassy was taken hostage by Iranian students in 1979.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I remember the case as we more or less
watched it live as it developed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Jimmy
Carter had just come to power, the Sha of Persia had fled Iran and taken exile
in the USA where he was being treated for cancer and the famous Ayotallah
Homeini returned from his own exile in Paris to Teheran to carry out the revolution
of the time when fundamentalism returned to the country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was because the USA had given refuge to
the Sha, that the furious students stormed the Embassy. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>But what I did not know about at the time was
that 6 of the staff had managed to escape and hide in the residence of the
Canadian Embassy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The story of their
rescue was portrayed in the film last night, certainly my film of the week.  You can see the <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EUJeahhFg0">official trailer here</a>.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We wanted to
have dinner at Ginos with Olivia after the film, but despite the crisis, every
restaurant in the leisure centre seemed to be choc a block.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In the end Olivia left us to go to a birthday
party in Madrid and Eladio and I drove into Majadahonda and had dinner at Hollywood.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>It was also pretty crowded and loud.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I noticed many places over decorated with the
up and coming Halloween theme, something I can never relate to, not having been
brought up on the tradition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The girls,
though, have and will be enjoying their Halloween party next week, on
Wednesday, the last day of October.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The
next day, 1<sup>st</sup> November will be a holiday and they will be able to
sleep off any excesses and hopefully we all have lunch again together that
day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So, no, there will be no “trick or
treating” in this house next week.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">And of course
last night, after coming back from the film and dinner, we came back to an
extra hour of sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That is because the
clocks went back an hour last night, officially ending summer time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It always takes some getting used to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The upside is that it will lighter when we
get up in the morning and the downside is that it will be darker when we go on
our walk in the afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
