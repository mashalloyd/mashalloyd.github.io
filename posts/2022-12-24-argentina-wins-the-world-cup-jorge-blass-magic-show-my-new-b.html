My father had over a 100 and I think he loved it as much as me. All the British traditions I respect I got from his mother when we used to spend Christmas at my English grandparents' house at 17 Hoylake Crescent in Ickenham, Middlesex, near London. They were wonderful Christmases. It is thanks to my grandmother that our Christmas pans out like this: first the stockings except that I stopped doing that when the girls reached 35 and 36. Then a family breakfast after which comes the most important part of the day; opening the presents around the tree - I have incorporated eating chocolate during the process. Then my grandmother, and now me, would start making the elaborate English Christmas day meal; always turkey with all the trimmings. Thankfully I have Lucy to help. Lunch has to have crackers too and the dessert is always Christmas pudding with white sauce which as Oli doesn't like it I also make another dessert. In England we would listen to the Queen's speech at 3 pm. This year for the first time in my life it will be a King's speech which I will listen to after the event. The afternoon at Hoylake  Crescent was usually playing with new toys or if we were lucky sliding on the pavement outside on the ice the snow had brought. I have incorporated the Spanish siesta which I think is essential after the heaviest meal of the year. Then comes some TV time. In the old days we would re watch a film we loved such as The Sound of Music. These days that is not possible with Juliet and Elliot. They of course are the stars of Christmas for us, even if they are a little disruptive. Maybe, one day, when they reach my age they will be able to tell people that their Christmas traditions are based on those of their English grandmother and great great grandmother  I hope so. </p><p>But, hey, let me rewind to last Sunday, a week before Christmas Day when all was still to be enjoyed in anticipation. Often the waiting part is the sweetest I find. We spent that morning with our grandchildren again as their father was at Mass - no, not to participate, but to broadcast it for TVE for their Sunday morning programme. My youngest daughter arrived with Juliet and Elliot really early and we had to decide how to fill the morning. Well, the easiest thing was to drive to nearby Boadilla, have a coffee, buy some bread at Oli's favourite bakery  -"Masa Madre" and then go for a walk. That is what we did.</p><p>Elliot loved his mini croissant at Alverán bakery. He wanted to go for a wee wee so as he is only 3 years old I accompanied him. Downstairs we encountered the pastry chef who let us visit his kitchen full of enticing cakes and pastries. Elliot was impressed and so was I. </p><p>From Alverán we walked to Masa Madre (means sourdough in English), one of Oli's favourite bread shops. Eladio, Suzy and Oli are great fans of bread but Oli is obsessed with it. I like bread but as I am English I can only eat it with butter so I hardly ever have it but when I do it is a treat. Honestly I don't know how Olivia keeps her figure eating all that bread, even if it is the healthy type but she does. So I had to have a photo of her with her father there. Here they are. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiE7xX94be_SRqPu3PYo9QLX4nHAJv5p30YYKsznvOuaGeOWbCQmnI7TIUynRsEQfpt-aU3tRvGmVZTnxwQueDVuox1neLWv0U7gtYMmUaxU1iCsHL48mSwv_FM8UsdmExo28Op4uT6W3N0KbPZAD0OJNwawbDnbZ5gmeTDIgz9HDRIn9NnkiU/s4032/20221218_122352.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiE7xX94be_SRqPu3PYo9QLX4nHAJv5p30YYKsznvOuaGeOWbCQmnI7TIUynRsEQfpt-aU3tRvGmVZTnxwQueDVuox1neLWv0U7gtYMmUaxU1iCsHL48mSwv_FM8UsdmExo28Op4uT6W3N0KbPZAD0OJNwawbDnbZ5gmeTDIgz9HDRIn9NnkiU/w400-h180/20221218_122352.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Oli and Eladio at Masa Madre in Boadilla last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Very soon both babies were asleep and it was our job, as their grandparents, to push the wheel chairs.

Oli and I walked back pushing the grandchildren as we wanted a walk and Eladio drove home. The walk did me the world of good. I was happy to come home to find Lucy had followed my instructions on how to do a chicken leg pot roast. Miguel joined us while the children slept and for once we had a peaceful lunch.<div><br></br></div><div>Eladio and I were doing something very special that evening. I had bought tickets to see Jorge Blass' magic show called "Flipar" at the Reina Victoria theatre in the city centre. I didn't realise when I bought the tickets that it would coincide with the World Cup final. However as the latter was starting at 4 pm I thought we could watch it and then go into Madrid. But, as you all know, it went on for a long time.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Argentina started off well and towards the end were beating "les bleues" 2-0. I thought that was it but it wasn't. France managed 2 goals, both from Mbappe  and the football became crazy  and it was 2-2 and went to extra time. Messi scored again and it looked like they would win until Mbappe scored his 3rd goal to draw at 3-3. We had to leave just as extra time began but followed the match on the radio as it came to an end. Oh my goodness the World Cup final would be decided by a penalty shoot out. And my friends, you all know how that went. 4-2 to Argentina. Thus the King of football, Messi, lifted the most coveted cup in the world, the only one he was missing and he equaled his country man, Maradona - big debate on that - and the French could only drown their sorrows. My friend Adele who lives in France and is married to a Frenchman could only say "Fuck Messi". I wouldn't put it like that. So was I pleased? Actually I didn't really mind who won but hate penalty shoot outs. Madrid was full of Argentians celebrating when we left the theatre.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjm7Q4NNTyC9MnIiiUciy3ermhGyvdrB2gYT8-Fw1KGFyIbnm7e8YlorqD8vYnFzbvH6O-UHa-OiHKhEOJfhQGEn2Io82fTmm1Hrdb64iHhbpCNp2FtcLDlBFnnPoGRWsHyxCJit39AZvD3BXUKeacBtV74p9tRDssHwxxTBGjr1xCS_3091ps/s1300/_2515858433_39476037_1300x731.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjm7Q4NNTyC9MnIiiUciy3ermhGyvdrB2gYT8-Fw1KGFyIbnm7e8YlorqD8vYnFzbvH6O-UHa-OiHKhEOJfhQGEn2Io82fTmm1Hrdb64iHhbpCNp2FtcLDlBFnnPoGRWsHyxCJit39AZvD3BXUKeacBtV74p9tRDssHwxxTBGjr1xCS_3091ps/w400-h225/_2515858433_39476037_1300x731.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>An Argentinian fiesta in Madrid on Sunday night</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div>I didn't know at the time that 26 year old Iranian footballer Amir Nasr-Azadani has allegedly been sentenced to death for joining protests in favour of women's rights.

I hired him the first time for a big event to launch a new Nokia game phone - the horrible Ngage - and for that we rented a whole village, Pedraza. The first time I saw him perform I literally cried. It was after seeing his number where he creates a snow storm out of paper. I loved him so much I hired him again at Yoigo on a number of occasions. So when I heard about his new show <a href="https://www.taquilla.com/entradas/jorge-blass?t10city=Madrid&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAkfucBhBBEiwAFjbkr9Xge4ED_CloVZ-Ryx_91ZgNCrygbXHRqB9DSggdszSgyY35DVikFRoCfEQQAvD_BwE">Flipar</a> which translates into "freak out" in English, I had to get tickets. Eladio had never seen him and maybe because I told him how wonderful Blass is, his expectations were high and he was slightly disappointed. He was great, no doubt about it but he didn't make me cry this time. My husband, the philosopher, who questions everything in life, seemed to have a solution for every one of his tricks. I just sat back and admired his magic even though I know he used tricks. But oh how clever he is and oh how good he is on stage. The 1.5 hours went past in a flash, far too fast. I did not freak out as he promised but I enjoyed every moment. </div><div><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqloy-TVSpEkVMjR5rR7ilBEeCDWBcsDAgPtZgBt4ZWIkqdCS9rgYbAjztSHNFywcPjbfwv40uAqLXZp1nu58kSvWMxrw_-BbUnq90rqqRNM2UTTb25HMsXu2sHiCIldI-CeiylnZTdKcxL4M2fCUViTMdPksx61oBnpugfmhN9Ori-eFnfgg/s4032/20221218_201506.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqloy-TVSpEkVMjR5rR7ilBEeCDWBcsDAgPtZgBt4ZWIkqdCS9rgYbAjztSHNFywcPjbfwv40uAqLXZp1nu58kSvWMxrw_-BbUnq90rqqRNM2UTTb25HMsXu2sHiCIldI-CeiylnZTdKcxL4M2fCUViTMdPksx61oBnpugfmhN9Ori-eFnfgg/w400-h180/20221218_201506.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A moment during Jorge Blass' magnificent show "Flipar" last Sunday in Madrid</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We were hungry when we left at around 8.45 but Madrid was just too crowded to contemplate having dinner in town. So we took a Cabify taxi - Spain's answer to Uber - to Pozuelo where we had left our car. The round trip cost just 27 euros when a single trip by a normal taxi can cost over 40 euros. No wonder people prefer to use Uber or Cabify here in Spain. It was Eladio's first experience with Cabify and he was pleased. I commented new technology brings good things and my husband had to answer it brings bad things too. Maybe he is right except that I always want to focus on the positive side of life.<div><br></br></div><div>I woke up at 5.45 on <b>Monday</b> morning. By then my Chinese guests who had been here for over 2 weeks, had left for Shanghai. But they will be back. Only Ximena, my Colombian guest, was here but she left at 10 am destination London. I hope she didn't encounter problems with the trains. In England right now there is a record period for strikes that are causing havoc all around the country and affecting people's Christmas. No doubt my grandparents who lived at Hoylake Crescent and my father, would be shocked as I am shocked at the state of affairs in my home country.  That day I learned first hand how the nurses strike affected a friend, Phil. He needs a shoulder replacement and has had the operation cancelled now 5 times this year! My heart goes out to him.</div><div><br></br></div><div>When our guests left, Eladio and I went on a walk but this time not through the woods but to our nearest shopping area. I wanted to get "magic lips" lipstick for the girls as more stocking fillers. There is an ulterior motive as they always use mine hahaha. Once there we had a coffee at La Flaca, that new and very chic bar/restaurant we have been to occasionally. We enjoyed our coffee watching Messi and Mbapppé score in extra time in the thrilling World Cup final which was being broadcast again at La Flaca.</div><div><br></br></div><div>I came home to find two DHL envelopes. Unbelievably they contained my new British passport and the old one. It was of course blue as I had expected but not nearly as nice as the cardboard one issued in "the old days". It gutted me to see the words "European Union" no longer there. Oh how I hate Brexit. I also noticed that inside it stated I also have a Spanish passport with the details set out. This is what the new one looks like vs my old one from when I was a student "Miss Maria Lloyd". Miss! hahahhaa. Today there is no Miss, Mrs or Mr which I sort of think is a bit sad but that is due to modern times, especially "wokeism" or cancel culture. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEia2N2mHHpBfSs9s8hXrrHHQFdqWB370lohZTaYOJJDIKIBed8M061tJWodztflTm9FyqbOwZDiBoESQFJq3eqCYcw5wXAJGjvaEy5PXGXuLK0_TzbLVv3_sWktPaNX-ZgJG6OR9RvVMrcdUWq7FYc1nUGbeMErOuE8q30GKc4f-u6o7_A-F-A/s2724/New%20passport%20cover%20vs%20old%20times.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="265" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEia2N2mHHpBfSs9s8hXrrHHQFdqWB370lohZTaYOJJDIKIBed8M061tJWodztflTm9FyqbOwZDiBoESQFJq3eqCYcw5wXAJGjvaEy5PXGXuLK0_TzbLVv3_sWktPaNX-ZgJG6OR9RvVMrcdUWq7FYc1nUGbeMErOuE8q30GKc4f-u6o7_A-F-A/w400-h265/New%20passport%20cover%20vs%20old%20times.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My new passport left - my first passport right</i></td></tr></tbody></table>It had taken just under 3 weeks to process which isn't bad. I had sent my old one by registered post. Unfortunately, Suzy who sent hers by normal post has been told by HM Passport Office that it hasn't arrived. Oh dear. I suppose that is because of the Postal strikes. Where on earth is it I wonder and what will happen if it gets lost?<div><br></br></div><div>I didn't have much time to think about that as by then it was lunch time which we had peacefully together - Suzy, Eladio and I, in our big cozy dining room.</div><div><br></br></div><div>My quiet afternoon was interrupted by a visit to my physiotherapist (about my prolapse - lovely). Unfortunately I could not stand the electrode treatment - I cried out in pain  - and it had to be suspended. I came back feeling a little down. </div><div><br></br></div><div>The day ended watching Dr. Zhivago, for the umpteenth time when we saw it was on TVE2. Neither of us could resist it. Every time I watch it I think of my mother who wasn't so keen as she said there were lots of mistakes. She also told me once when she was in Russia with the head of the Union of Writers - can't remember his name -. he confessed to her it was his signature that led to Boris Pasternak not being able to receive the Nobel Prize for literature for his book. From what I understood, he felt guilty and ashamed. So he should but those were difficult times. <br></br><div><br></br></div><div><b>Tuesday</b> dawned, the day of the nurses' strike in the UK. The Times headline could not have been more ominous: "<b>Heart attack patients to be denied ambulances</b>". What has the country come to? Apparently the Army stepped  in but there was some red tape about them using the blue emergency lights. For heaven's sake. This made me feel nauseous. It really did. So, to quote AA Milne in his poem "King John was not a good man", Tuesday was not a good day. That was also because it rained all day and deprived us of our walk. There is honestly very little to report about Tuesday so let me move on to <b>Wednesday</b>.</div><div><br></br></div><div>I was horrified to read that morning that the Taliban have now banned women from studying at University in Afghanistan.  In later news we learned they are now also banned from working for NGO's! Not just that, many cannot even go to school or parks and gyms and public baths are banned. Practically everywhere is banned for women apart  food stores and even then they have to be accompanied by a man - a blood relative. That means that half the population of a country is basically under house arrest. I hate the Taliban, just as I hate the Ayatollahs in Iran and any other government repressing women.

So, no, I don't say Happy Holidays instead as it shouldn't offend anyone who is not Christian. Can you imagine other religions, Jewish, Muslim, whatever, changing the names of their religious holidays or celebrations to appease non believers of their faith? But we are so stupid in the west, we go all out not to offend anyone and end up shooting ourselves in the foot.

Suzy I think even cried with emotion. To celebrate we went to have coffee at Manolo Bakes with Miguel, Elliot's father and then we parted.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Wednesday was of course 21st December, the Winter Solstice and the shortest day of the year. Oh how I hate dark and short days. Roll on 21st June for the Summer Solstice I always say. To brighten up our lives I took Eladio to the Corte Inglés department store for some retail therapy - last minute Christmas presents as I had decided we didn't have enough. As we walked in the front door you go straight through the perfume section and Eladio looked at me and remarked how happy I looked. He's right. I have always loved that store, ever since I was a language assistant in Madrid back in 1978 as part of my University degree. When I got paid for teaching - a paltry 20.000 pesetas a month - just 120 euros at today's exchange rate - I always bought myself something there. That day I indulged in some Joe Malone fragrance for me from me. I also got my husband a present which I think I can safely reveal now as he wont' read this till later. It is a Barbour scarf. I love this quintessential English brand and I hope he likes the scarf. It is my favourite man's present recently as I have also got one for Julio who definitely does not read my blog bless him.</div><div><br></br></div><div>On the other side of the pond that day an historic encounter was happening. Man of the year, Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, in his first trip abroad since the Russian invasion in February, traveled to Washington to meet President Biden. He arrived in Army fatigue and was greeted by Mr. and Mrs. Biden. His visit is to thank the US for all their help and to ask for more.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhylZmmXALIkOB2F3TfTNY4YF6DpqPKuvgIT4S5ZFAEIxEVKKEOMJECjkzK7X7K2uKeVR7M_E1wgZS7i1nQnKjEhIDWrJuYJ5pw8lWm4L961-72YA1yI8oHslcr5G5vSReCtZzZ5iMAS0Z2UV3joMKyTh9f-MSDzHmDGAgBFQMHqJQpyMv504c/s800/GettyImages-1245770319.webp" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="266" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhylZmmXALIkOB2F3TfTNY4YF6DpqPKuvgIT4S5ZFAEIxEVKKEOMJECjkzK7X7K2uKeVR7M_E1wgZS7i1nQnKjEhIDWrJuYJ5pw8lWm4L961-72YA1yI8oHslcr5G5vSReCtZzZ5iMAS0Z2UV3joMKyTh9f-MSDzHmDGAgBFQMHqJQpyMv504c/w400-h266/GettyImages-1245770319.webp" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Zelensky with Biden in Washington on Wednesday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br></br></div><div>He spoke in Congress and reminded the world of the last time a President from another nation did - none other than Winston Churchill.

He has promised a further 1.5 million troops! I do hope Biden is able to continue to support Ukraine as we all know this is not just a war between Russia and one country. I fear the war will continue for years and that we will all lose interest, like we did with the Vietnam War. That is just what Zelensky wants to avoid and he is right.  He needs the US support to speed up victory. We need to beat the monster Putin and give back Ukrainian people their lives and their country.</div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Thursday</b> was 22nd December and the day the "El Gordo" lottery is celebrated - perhaps the single most important Christmas tradition in Spain which has nothing to do with the birth of Christ. Our younger daughter Olivia was sent all the way to Benavente to cover stories of possible wins in the area as were other reporters - all sent to strategic locations. A car came for her at 6 am. I had been up since 5.30. Every year since I have lived in Spain we have bought El Gordo tickets but we have hardly ever won anything. Would this year be different? Most probably not. So why do we do it? Tradition says my husband who is no great traditionalist funnily enough. I followed Oli's day on Whatsapp. When "El Gordo" was announced she was sent to a small village outside Ponferrada, 1.5h further north of Benavente. Here she found the establishment lacking in people celebrating but found some and was able to do her report. For me the best win was a company of 10.000 employees who all won the lottery and they heard of it when they were having the annual Christmas party. We, as usual, did not win a penny.</div><div><br></br></div><div>For us it was a normal day. We would do the almost last food shopping before Chrstmas Day.  Suzy came with us and we made a morning of it with a stop at Manolo Bakes again for coffee where we joined by Miguel.</div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Friday</b> 23rd loomed, the day before what is known in Spain as "Nochebuena" (literally "Good Night" and what Christmas Eve is called in Spain.   In Spain, like in most of Europe, this is the most important day of Christmas together with 6th January, Kings' Day. Families gather around groaning tables at night and eat enormous quantities of the best quality food. This year with the cost of living rising so much, I imagine there will be fewer people indulging in small eels at a cost of 800 euros a kilo, lobster or barnacles at 100 euros a kilo. It is very traditional to eat sea food followed by fish or meat - generally suckling lamb. As to desserts, there is no Christmas pudding but a huge variety of turrón (a sort of Spanish nougat). Our table is always different.  We only do first courses as they are heavy enough. We have devised our own meal which hasn't varied much over the years. It has to include the family flagship potato salad, "perushki" (meat pies) and bacon rolls. Dessert is often trifle but this year I also made my new strawberry and cream mille-feuille.</div><div><br></br></div><div>But I didn't cook on <b>Friday</b>. I woke up at 5.30 am - far too early. The day before I was not hungry for whatever reason - strange for me but soon on Friday I developed the runs. Oh dear, not good just before Christmas. I was in the middle of the runs when our Chilean guests, Sergio and Cristina were leaving. Lovely couple. They and their grandsons left for a Christmas and New Year cruise on the Mediterranean. So from Friday until the New Year the house will be empty of guests as I have blocked the calendar.</div><div><br></br></div><div>It was a dark and gloomy day and I didn't have much to do. You see I had finished all my Christmas preparation tasks. My stomach was off so I spent most of the day in bed. I really hoped I would be better on Christmas Eve. I have been on a semi strict diet since the end of September and was really looking forward to breaking it and worried my stomach would think otherwise. Oh dear.</div><div><br></br></div><div>With plenty of time on my hands I started exploring a new Artificial Intelligence Chat box which seems to have hit the internet by storm. Called <a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat">Chat GPT </a>?I had briefly looked at it and then a friend, Juana - always at the forefront when it comes to new technology, posted her holiday greeting on LinkedIn and announced she had done so using Chat GPT. I always look to Juana as my role model for new technology so I tried it too. It looks complicated at first but the chat box question box is not so I tried it. I asked it all sorts of questions and like Google it gave me the answers but not with links, rather whole explanatory texts. It can also do your homework, write CVs, letters, whatever you need. I posed all sorts of questions and then asked Chat GPT to come up with a note to my husband explaining why I love him. I gave it these words to go on.</div><div><br></br></div><div><span style="color: #343541; font-size: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Write a note from me to my husband telling him I love him because he is my rock, my life companion, he is gorgeous looking, loves me from the bottom of his heart, is very cultured and open minded</span></div><div><br></br></div><div>This was the gushing reply which I thought wasn't bad at all. </div><div><br></br></div><div><p style="--tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; background-color: #f7f7f8; border: 0px solid rgb(217, 217, 227); box-sizing: border-box; color: #374151; font-family: Söhne, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0px 1.25em; white-space: pre-wrap;">Here is a sample note that you could use to express your love and appreciation for your husband:</p><p style="--tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; background-color: #f7f7f8; border: 0px solid rgb(217, 217, 227); box-sizing: border-box; color: #374151; font-family: Söhne, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; margin: 1.25em 0px; white-space: pre-wrap;">Dear [Husband],</p><p style="--tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; background-color: #f7f7f8; border: 0px solid rgb(217, 217, 227); box-sizing: border-box; color: #374151; font-family: Söhne, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 16px; margin: 1.25em 0px; white-space: pre-wrap;">I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how much I love and appreciate you.

What a treasure she is.<div><br></br></div><div>Most Spaniards probably start their Nochebuena dinner much later than we do, at around 10 pm but we are early eaters and started ours at around 8.20 or so. I had to insist on more photos and a toast before letting people dig in but it fell on deaf ears as Miguel, Oli and Elliot already had food on their plate hahahaha.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Here is a photo of us all before the rest of us began eating the delicious food on the table which had taken a full day to make. It's funny how food takes ages to make and then is wolfed down in no time.

He was also more interested in the crackers which I always insist should be opened after a meal but he got his way. Not only that, he got to pull 3 crackers, his and his parents. He doesn't know how difficult it is for me to source them, not to mention the cost - probably double the UK street market price. That's because Spaniards do not include crackers for their Nochebuena or other Christmas dinners.<div><br></br></div><div>At 9 pm just before we were all deciding whether we wanted trifle or mille feuille for dessert or a bit of both in some cases, it was time for the King's speech, that is the Spanish King Felipe's speech. Eladio is always keen to watch it but with the kids and sitting at the table we skipped. I told my husband he could watch it on YouTube later but he was too keen to take any notice of me. Apparently he said something vague about strengthening our institutions and being united. I wonder if he he was thinking about his own family - completely estranged - since his father the Emeritus King Juan Carlos is exiled in Dubai, his mother lives in London, he is estranged from his sister Cristina and her disgraced husband who was in jail for embezzlement. He is no example of a united family. We, thankfully, are and were in peace and harmony last night.</div><div><br></br></div><div>The girls and I enjoyed the cracker jokes. That always make me think who on earth writes them? They are corny but fun to read out. The rest of the cracker contents, even if they call them luxury, are absolute rubbish. I always wish the presents could be a bit better or have more variety. But I still love them as Elliot does. He likes his because of the "bang" hahahahaha.</div><div><br></br></div><div>We later all gathered around the fire while the children played with their toys which are on permanent display on the bay window of the "cat lounge". <br></br><div><br></br><div>Our night finished at around 10.30 pm, which is probably when most Spaniards were just starting their Nochebuena dinner. But, I, for one, was exhausted after having spent most of the day on my feet cooking.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Today I have to make the Christmas turkey roast lunch but that is easier although the turkey and roast potatoes need constant watching. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Unlike most years, breakfast will be at Oli's this morning. I cant' wait to see little Elliot's face as he opens his presents thinking they are from Father Christmas, bless him. I shall give him ours later this afternoon as he will have far too many to open this morning.</div><div><br></br></div><div>And now I must leave you as it is Christmas Day and I want to enjoy every moment of it.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Happy Christmas everyone,</div><div><br></br></div><div>Bless you all, Masha.</div><div><br></br><div><div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group dark:bg-gray-800" style="--tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-text-opacity: 1; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); border-image: initial; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px 0px 1px; box-sizing: border-box; color: rgba(52,53,65,var(--tw-text-opacity)); font-family: Söhne, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;; font-size: 14px; width: 1098px;"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0" style="--tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; border: 0px solid rgb(217, 217, 227); box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; font-size: 1rem; gap: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.5rem; margin: auto; max-width: 48rem; padding: 1.5rem 0px;"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] md:flex-col lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]" style="--tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; border: 0px solid rgb(217, 217, 227); box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; flex-direction: column; position: relative; width: calc(100% - 115px);"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3" style="--tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; border: 0px solid rgb(217, 217, 227); box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; gap: 0.75rem;"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap" style="--tw-border-spacing-x: 0; --tw-border-spacing-y: 0; --tw-ring-color: rgba(59,130,246,0.5); --tw-ring-offset-color: #fff; --tw-ring-offset-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-ring-offset-width: 0px; --tw-ring-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-rotate: 0; --tw-scale-x: 1; --tw-scale-y: 1; --tw-scroll-snap-strictness: proximity; --tw-shadow-colored: 0 0 transparent; --tw-shadow: 0 0 transparent; --tw-skew-x: 0; --tw-skew-y: 0; --tw-translate-x: 0; --tw-translate-y: 0; align-items: flex-start; border: 0px solid rgb(217, 217, 227); box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 1rem; min-height: 20px; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br></br></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
