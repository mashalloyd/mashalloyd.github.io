Since 2019, the Socialist party (PSOE) led by "Mr Handsome" - Pedro Sánchez in a coalition government with the communist party and support of the ex terrorist group ETA as well as Catalan separatists, was forecast to lose to the right wing. The right wing consists of the opposition party PP (People's party) and the extreme right wing party Vox. That's what all the polls said but they were wrong. Despite the date - late July, with many people on holiday, 70% voted, we learned later.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But first to celebrate and after voting at the UEM, off we went to have a coffee with churros. Then we had a quiet day at home. Our Italian guests - Matteo and his lovely wife Simona and their little girls were visiting Toledo - phew it must have been hot.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Where it was not only hot but raging with fire was on the island of Rhodes in Greece. The pictures we saw were Dantesque. The British press was full of stories of their compatriots on holiday there being evacuated. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">35ºc in Madrid was nothing in comparison but still too hot to eat outside. Thus we had my freshly made boeuf stroganof in the dining room after which we retired to our air conditioned quarters. My dear friends Sandra, in Brussels, and Adele at a family wedding in Yorkshire, complained of the cold and rain!</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Polling stations closed at 8 pm - elections are always on a Sunday and voting takes place from 9 am to 8 pm. By 9 pm we were glued to the TV anxious, as many people were, to know what the result would be. From the very start it looked like there would be a tie. To govern, each side need 176 seats. By the time we went to sleep it looked like stale mate.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I woke up on <b>Monday</b> morning and what we had learned the night before was confirmed. Basically we have a hung parliament. This is what the picture looks like.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiUIHePMWST_rGsLsUTUoBHzJT4fv6gSS4Ujqn4eLThibOEnaKESQC6YOybUbWX6JLu0xGzx1mYSuAKSlClpjnWq2axFhYdjBdmcPgkd7aGjV15jh-fD4Hkwx7LME8VCqr3Fq4Xz5gVdiCmVw3ld5lm3eZxc1ZmS_m1gkt20pE0xUoje4fY70Y3mQ/s2732/unnamed.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiUIHePMWST_rGsLsUTUoBHzJT4fv6gSS4Ujqn4eLThibOEnaKESQC6YOybUbWX6JLu0xGzx1mYSuAKSlClpjnWq2axFhYdjBdmcPgkd7aGjV15jh-fD4Hkwx7LME8VCqr3Fq4Xz5gVdiCmVw3ld5lm3eZxc1ZmS_m1gkt20pE0xUoje4fY70Y3mQ/w400-h300/unnamed.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The outcome of the General Elections</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><p style="text-align: justify;">PP  got 136 seats and with 32 from Vox they would obtain 169 seats. The PSOE got 122 and with the support of their previous supporters would obtain about 171 or 172 seats. So neither side has enough to govern which is a hung parliament. The only key, or rather kingmaker,  here is the PDCAT party - the right wing and radical Catalan independence party - the fugitive Carlos Puigdemont's old party. They have 7 seats. So they are the key but at a hefty price. I wouldn't put it past them asking for a referendum in exchange for their support. The last resort will of course be new elections. These results were in the Congress - the lower house (house of commons). However, to make things even more difficult, the right wing PP party obtained more than a majority in the Senado (upper house). That's the house that usually passes laws, so if Sánchez governs again, this could be a big obstacle.  Later in the week the plot thickened when the PP got one more seat from overseas voters, tying the two parties to 171 each. Now the PSOE needs Puigdemont not only to abstain but to vote for the new government. Let's see how all this pans out.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I couldn't think too much about the elections as we had to get ready to go to Montrondo. Meanwhile, our lovely Italian family from Piacenza, were leaving and wanted a photo with us. We wanted one with them too. They were lovely people; the perfect family with perfect daughters. They told us we were "special people". All people are special but it was nice to hear that. They are also a family of travelers like us and it was good to exchange experiences. We spoke to them mostly in English with a bit of Italian and a bit of Spanish. Eladio later exclaimed in Spanish "manda cojones" - needs no translation .- that a Spaniard and an Italian had to speak English to each other, hahaha. This is the photo by the way. Goodbye Matteo and Simona, we hope you come again.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-IV6_R2u3Ac_Iq_ZTMwoGye3aeZf0mP6pnrt5-dVL_CUFHUSrWQ-YgF1rBOZR4NMnhFGyA_SMzNa7AKwiybc6PKIUvSyxNx7z2IN-0Ph1DzFDO0atO_lgUsqL-Yjg7uuFDlm6rQwcVjBqqvP6nbl0eGo1_SmIxh3sKMtmfCnTGkeqoJCvLIiHqA/s4032/20230724_083014.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-IV6_R2u3Ac_Iq_ZTMwoGye3aeZf0mP6pnrt5-dVL_CUFHUSrWQ-YgF1rBOZR4NMnhFGyA_SMzNa7AKwiybc6PKIUvSyxNx7z2IN-0Ph1DzFDO0atO_lgUsqL-Yjg7uuFDlm6rQwcVjBqqvP6nbl0eGo1_SmIxh3sKMtmfCnTGkeqoJCvLIiHqA/w400-h180/20230724_083014.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A goodbye photo with our lovely Italian family who booked rooms on Airbnb at our home. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">We had hoped to leaver early but that was not to be as we had to pick up the Volvo from the garage where they had repaired a petrol leak. We picked it up at around 12.30, came home, packed it to the full with lots of food and off we went at around 1.30. We had planned to have lunch at Palacio de Bornos in Rueda but unfortunately we had a breakdown just after having driven 80km. The car shuddered to a stop, the accelerator wouldn't respond and somehow Eladio managed to swerve it onto the hard shoulder which wasn't a safe place to be on the busy AP6 motorway that leads to La Coruña from Madrid. We rang our insurance company who sent us both a taxi and a tow truck but we had to wait about 40 minutes. We stood outside the car and Eladio put on a yellow reflector vest so as to be seen from afar. This is him and this was the unpleasant moment.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjcrQ0rg20JvFbYNjcjkZOhvVwYeAFMUEUkXQJdIslgMM4hy893dOpNLovJ4R14FRBj6_KS4o80WXWp5cdv2AmCadSdPej0ItokYwF7OubF0D0vCXSlUjdXjUEZqiY5h2vDl3qz5541fywfF2khyLmgXejj4jycUAQT0ZDFz7QPn4wBxu4H3hpi-Q/s4032/20230724_141703.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjcrQ0rg20JvFbYNjcjkZOhvVwYeAFMUEUkXQJdIslgMM4hy893dOpNLovJ4R14FRBj6_KS4o80WXWp5cdv2AmCadSdPej0ItokYwF7OubF0D0vCXSlUjdXjUEZqiY5h2vDl3qz5541fywfF2khyLmgXejj4jycUAQT0ZDFz7QPn4wBxu4H3hpi-Q/w400-h180/20230724_141703.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The car broke down on our way to Montrondo on Monday - not a pleasant moment</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Eventually we were picked up and taken home and the car was taken to the garage which it had just left that morning. We sat down to have lunch at 4 pm - rather late for us  - and half an hour later were on our way again, this time in the Mini. The garage rang us while we were driving to tell us that when the Volvo arrived the start engine worked fine. The garage did all sorts of tests but couldn't find anything wrong. How strange. Our drive took us from the heat of Madrid to the cool of the mountains in Montrondo. We arrived to just 14ºc, believe it or not. We even had to switch on the central heating. So, as you see, not all of Spain is undergoing a heat wave. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Oli and family were supposed to have come on Monday with us but they had a bad day and wouldn't join us until Tuesday morning. We settled in, had a simple dinner of some soup I had brought and then sat down to watch the news which, of course was all about the aftermath of the elections. That's all we are going to hear about in the next 2 months I suppose. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I slept well but woke up at 6.30 am on <b>Tuesday</b>. We had lots to do to prepare for Oli and her family's arrival. I spent most of the morning cooking quietly - making chicken curry for lunch and tortilla for dinner. Eladio got out all the outdoor furniture and at about midday we had our first morning coffee on the front terrace. Here is my husband enjoying the moment.</div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9TbAbqhKaR8gvb7yPk25w34KpeabIx3_wENPLamjywxCzltkHqXO-WpQznWiY5jvNWW0-rask_3LtmeRO1gYXcjKJcZ-yBNfCVFT6cRdzFL5a_TFL8uJf7M7oFceoUsI5Omry4YufAbdHJmDFqGLb7eUNdbb3FjILKK4PxD91-Wm8osXGFz0ImQ/s4032/20230725_115648.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9TbAbqhKaR8gvb7yPk25w34KpeabIx3_wENPLamjywxCzltkHqXO-WpQznWiY5jvNWW0-rask_3LtmeRO1gYXcjKJcZ-yBNfCVFT6cRdzFL5a_TFL8uJf7M7oFceoUsI5Omry4YufAbdHJmDFqGLb7eUNdbb3FjILKK4PxD91-Wm8osXGFz0ImQ/w400-h180/20230725_115648.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Coffee time on Tuesday morning</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">We had lunch on our own as Oli and family had set off too late to join us.

Little Juliet who will be 2 in September, did not remember the village. My grandson had hoped all his little cousins would be here but unfortunately only one was here; Andres aged nearly 3. But they played well together. It was fun to watch them.</div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">Later I went for a little walk with Elliot to see how much he remembered of the village. Soon we were joined by his parents and Juliet. The pond in the middle of the village green called El Campo (the field) is always a pull for children. It used to be where people got their water and for cows to drink from. Now it is clean but the water is very cold. Elliot insisted in putting his feet in, so I joined him as did Juliet. Oli took some photos of us having fun together. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi7wc_YHIuB719cDDJ7EtkasOhN0FDm60lymIOoH-UmiQgk-q9vn9xqy1SG5IgFXZGUbudiG6PId3EM96LUew6UZu_POgYHbkCa9DL34NfyZYG3gepP6Sqa9cHBEzMd9zt16aqu3ulyAJP_7ZIc5OoOsv4R5yCzKGSDuHVUaT6cK8dqWl0TaOS3NQ/s4032/20230725_192235.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi7wc_YHIuB719cDDJ7EtkasOhN0FDm60lymIOoH-UmiQgk-q9vn9xqy1SG5IgFXZGUbudiG6PId3EM96LUew6UZu_POgYHbkCa9DL34NfyZYG3gepP6Sqa9cHBEzMd9zt16aqu3ulyAJP_7ZIc5OoOsv4R5yCzKGSDuHVUaT6cK8dqWl0TaOS3NQ/w400-h180/20230725_192235.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>With my grandchildren with our feet in the water</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Dinner was a joy. My tortillas were most popular and we laid a veritable spread. Later I went out with the kids to the trampoline. Their parents went for an evening walk - it gets dark here at 10 pm, and I remained alone with Juliet and Elliot. The latter insisted I got onto the trampoline with them and I did so and it was such fun. They were a little worried about their parents' absence so I asked my grandson if he was ok to be with me and if he loved me. He said he did and that he loved "Booboo" (his word for abuelo (grandfather) in Spanish) too. They then insisted on going back into the house to "play" with Booboo and we had more quality time and fun with them until their parents were back. I was happy to have given them a break.</div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We got into bed, exhausted, at just after 11 pm. That night I slept like a baby and didn't get up until 8.30 on <b>Wednesday</b> morning. I got up at the same time as Juliet and Elliot and of course spent the day with them. They are adorable but exhausting. The highlight of the day was walking to Murias and back, seeing a pony on the way and above all coffee while they were asleep at Hotel Rural La Carcél.

morning was slow so there was no time for a walk. Instead we took the car to
Senra to have a coffee at the grumpy man's bar. That was the highlight of the
day. Oli and Miguel went to Villablino to get lettuce and loads more food which
hardly fit in the fridge while we took Elliot in our car back to Montrondo. On
the way I showed him the pony, the big horse and a herd of cows with a small
bullock. He was most interested and wanted to know what a horse produces. We
told him horses are mostly for riding and that their meat is not eaten much
these days, although I'm not so sure about that. </span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: Roboto; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-ligatures: none;"></span></p>

arrived bringing more small cousins for Juliet and Elliot to play with. I
was especially pleased to see José Antonio and Dolores arrive (Eladio's
