<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Well I’m back now and have satiated my need to be with
Suzy and in England until next time.  It
was a great 6 days with its ups and downs, so let me tell you all about it.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I flew to Gatwick on Thursday 25<sup>th</sup> August
with Easy Jet, my preferred low cost airline. 
It was incident free thankfully. 
My flight was mid-morning and I arrived at around 2 p.m.  I went straight to Victoria and from there took a taxi to the Langham Hotel in Portland Place where Suzy had booked a table for lunch at <a href="http://palm-court.co.uk/#/afternoon-tea/">The Palm Court Restaurant</a>.  It was a beautiful restaurant made even lovelier by the piano player's music.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I couldn't wait to see Suzy and when she came the two of us hugged emotionally in front of everybody in the restaurant.  But we didn't care.  The restaurant boasted it offered the best afternoon tea in town.  I didn't really believe it but was bowled over when it came. I think it really was the best I've ever had.  The cakes were like a work of art.  Just look at the photos.</span></div>

It was time for me to see where she worked.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">In order to help her patients and to understand the diet more, Suzy herself followed it and lost 5kg in one month. I was tickled pink to watch and listen to Suzy in a patient consultation.  When you go to a clinic to lose weight you feel very vulnerable but Suzy made everyone feel completely comfortable, she is so kind and helpful to them all. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">No one knew I was the dietitian's mother, so I asked a couple who had come into the clinic for some of the products what they thought of it.  The wife told me her husband had lost 16 kilos in one month!  Men of course lose more than women on diets.  Gradually the clinic filled up and I had to go. It was there and then I made up my mind I shall go on the Pronokal diet this month, after the family wedding in Malaga. Watch this space ok.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We ordered a taxi for me via the Addison Lee app (similar to Uber) which took me quickly to Suzy's new flat in Hackney.  She gave me the keys and I was able to get in easily.  Whilst in London everyone kept telling me how trendy the area was but I didn't see it that way.  It seemed very dirty to me, as did most of London I must say.  The flat Suzy is sharing with her Spanish "manada" friends had my heart drop when I saw it as it had so many flaws and was not a place I would like my daughters to live in.  More than anything it is a depressing abode. They have cleaned it as best they could but there is no way they can get rid of the decades of grime it has accumulated. On the bright side, the flat is central, light and for once has a lounge.  Suzy very unfairly was made to take the small room which can hardly fit a double bed in it but that's a story which isn't for this post.  Thus my suitcase stayed outside on the landing. As soon as I had organised it, had a shower and dressed, I was off again.  I was to meet Suzy at Mile End Tube Station from where we were going for dinner to her ex flat mates, Vicky and Julieta's new place whom she had lived with in Camden.</span></div>

Shopping in England has changed and it's nearly all self service these days. I can do it but very slowly and felt a little like a country bumpkin. Suzy, on the other hand, does it in a jiffy.  Here she is at the automated self check out counter.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Suzy who bikes or walks everywhere in London both to do exercise and to save money on public transport guided me home walking along the canal.  I have an aversion to dirty old canals with narrow paths and especially hate them at night. The added problem was all the bikes coming up behind us. We seemed to be in London Fields much appreciated but not in my mind.  It was a balmy evening and in fact the day before had been the hottest day of the year with 31 c.  It was hotter in Madrid with 36 c but it is of course more humid in London.  I didn't look forward to sharing Suzy's small double bed with the worst mattress and springs I have ever slept on. However I must have been very tired as in the end I didn't sleep at all badly. Later in the week the landlords were going to change the mattresses but not the springs. They have a lot more to change and mend and the girls have made a very long list.  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">On Friday I was up at 7.30 (6.30 for me).  We had a lovely breakfast together despite there being no chairs in the flat (the landlord has refused on this point).  So we ate sitting on the sofa.  Suzy would be leaving for work (her timetable is from 11 am to 7 pm) and I had a plan for the day. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"> As I told you in my last post I would be visiting Ickenham, the village where my Aunty Gloria, Uncle Derek and cousins Jacqueline, Michael and Antony lived as well as my grandparents, all on my Father's side.  It's a village I know very well, on the Metroplitan line to Uxbridge, because we spent every Christmas there when I was a child.  They died tragically in the <a href="http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19710523-0">Rijeka Air Crash on 23rd May 1971</a> on their way to a holiday in the island of Krk where my Aunt and Uncle had fallen in love 14 years before. This is a tragedy that has lived with me always and which you can read more about in a <a href="http://mashalloyd.blogspot.com.es/2010/11/confession-from-felipe-gonzalez-quiet.html">post</a> I wrote some years ago. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">What spurred me on to visit their grave was a message to me I found on FB messenger a short while ago from the sole survivor's  (</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%;">Jrajko Sarajcic) daughter Iva and one from a woman called Jenny who wrote to me from Ickenham to say the tragedy had never left the village. Indeed it hasn't. She also told me there was a stained glass window in the church (St. Giles) in memory of them which I didn't know about  and I wanted to see.  I had phoned the church and spoken to Stephanie the administrator and she had agreed for me to visit and open the church for me.  So off I went with a heavy heart.  I made my way to Baker Street to get the Metropolitan line from where it takes about 40 minutes to Ickenham. I knew most of the names of the stations on the way off by heart from my childhood visits to see my adored Aunty, cousins and grandparents.  </span></div>

In fact it was looking lovely with lots of flowers everywhere and it was a beautiful day.  I went past the library where I had been many times with Aunty Gloria and past the pub, the Coach and Horses and just across the road from the beautiful pump was the 800 year old church (or so Stephanie told me).</span></div>

I bought a plant of red roses and a card which came with a plastic cover to withstand the weather.  As I walked back to the church I thought about what I should write.  I could have written much much more but there were only 2 sides and this is what I wrote on my postcard.</span></span></div>

I also reflected on how glad I was that my grandfather, Canon John Lloyd who died aged 74 (when I was just 4 years old but whom I remember very well) in 1961 and my Grandmother, Dorothy Gertrude Lloyd (née Scull) who died in 1971 just a short while before Aunty Gloria and Uncle Derek decided to go on holiday to Yugoslavia to show their children, my cousins, their island, did not outlive the death of their beloved daughter Gloria and their grandchildren.  It would have been just too cruel and another huge blow as their other son, Raymond died in 1939 aged just 16 of polio, a tragedy that has lived on in the family ever since.  But I also remembered the good times, our very English Christmases spent there and how my Grandmother would bring up supper on a tray to my brother and I which always included an orange each (I still have that tray) I remember too picking peas from the garden and skating with my new roller skates on the pavement in the street and so many other things.  The happiness of going to Ickenham stopped when the air crash happened but I have never forgotten them or their village.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; line-height: 16.8667px;">Once home I investigated more on the air crash and even set up a FB page in memory of it  for friends and families of victims or survivors to contact me.  You see over the years, via this blog, quite a few people have written to me. If you are one of them, this is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Rijeka-air-crash-23rd-May-1971-1516379731722211/?fref=ts">page</a>.  I also revisited the <a href="http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19710523-0">website </a>where there is a description of the crash. In previous visits I had missed the final report on the accident which is there.  It's too painful to explain here why the plane crashed but if you are interested you can read about it <a href="http://asndata.aviation-safety.net/reports/1971/19710523-0_T134_YU-AHZ.pdf">here</a>.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; line-height: 16.8667px;">I also looked through files of documents and papers in my desk and came across the pile of clippings and letters related to the accident that my Father had kept and given to me a while ago.  At the time I didn't have the heart to read the articles but today as I am writing (right now it is Friday) I was amazed to find one about the survivor, Jrajko Sarajcic, who was 22 at the time.  This is his story which I hope if you click on the photo and enlarge it you can read.</span></span></div>

This one is particularly poignant although inaccurate as my Aunt was not from Bradford (she was born in Sledmere in 1926 but was brought up mostly in Henbury in Bristol) and my Uncle could not have been 40 as she was 45 at the time) but it tells their story. I don't know who gave the newspapers their photos, but this one of my cousins I know well as an original copy is in our family album.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 14.6667px; line-height: 16.8667px;">I walked back to the tube station reflecting on all this.  But there were happy things awaiting me and I was in London to see Suzy and to be with her.  I caught the tube back to Baker Street and walked from there to Harley Street where I waited for Suzy to start her break. We decided to do what most London workers do and that is eat their sandwich in a park. We bought nice food at Pret a Manger and ate it together at Cavendish Park.  It was funny to see how dry the grass was because of the weather. Had it been Spain there would have been an irrigation system in place but I suppose there is no need for that in England as irrigation comes naturally from the normally abundant rain.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; line-height: 16.8667px;">Suzy had to go back to work but I stayed on in the park reading on my kindle.  The book I was reading was fascinating, "<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13547241-unorthodox">Unorthodox, the scandalous rejection of my Hasidic roots</a>".  The Hasidic Jews who are an extreme sect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haredi_Judaism">Haredic Judaism</a>, regard themselves as the most religiously authentic Jews although there are other extreme sects who claim the same. They are also the most extreme or so I read. </span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 14.6667px; line-height: 16.8667px;">  The author is Deborah Feldman who left the sect and in her book  she gave me a close insight into the plight of women in this extreme form of Judaism.  If you thought women from Saudi Arabia have it bad, then you should read this book.  Hasidic women are nothing but baby machines, allowed no personal thoughts and their whole lives are regulated.  The sect lives as if life has stood still, rejecting modern technology, books and TV.  It must be the most stifling religion on earth.  I'm glad she left although of course that means she can now have no contact whatsoever with her family. </span></div>

I did some shopping at Tesco, aided by a nice Pakistani woman (hate the check out machines aagghh).  I went home only to leave again a while later to meet Suzy for dinner in South Kensington. Suzy fancied Spanish food; something I had no need of as I live in Spain but I was happy to pander to her needs which I totally understood.  We booked a table at "<a href="http://www.cambiodetercio.co.uk/restaurantes/?id=3&amp;lg=en">Tendido Cero</a>", an up market tapas bar. I watched with glee as lots of French people were dining there.  The food was actually amazing; probably better than any tapas I have ever had in Spain</span></span></div>

In my last post I wrote about the book I had read by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Astor,_Viscountess_Astor">Nancy Astor</a>'s maid and how Cliveden House and the Cliveden set were involved in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profumo_affair">John Profumo scandal</a> in the sixties.  The "notorious mansion" is an  Italianate house built in the 17th century by the River Thames and near Taplow in Buckinghamshire, it has the most amazing grounds and gardens I have ever seen apart, perhaps, from Kew Gardens. Today the grounds belong to the National Trust and the house is a luxury hotel I would love to stay at one day. The photo illustrating this post is of Suzy and I in the parterre gardens by the South Terrace of Cliveden House.</span></span></div>

I was reluctant to leave such a beautiful place as we left The Long Garden and walked through the woods and fields of the huge grounds.  Then we spied our last jewel, The Rose Garden which existed always at Cliveden but which was developed and has changed over the years.  The garden we saw that day was the restoration from the plans by Geoffrey Jellicoe, Lord Astor's head gardener I think.  He created a wave of colour from roses starting with white, yellow, orange, pink and then red, an incredible creation. </div>

We had to get a cab back and our kind Pakistani driver gave us a brief history of his country on the short drive to Taplow.  Suzy left me at Paddington as she went off to get a bike to ride home.  I took the tube to Highbury and Islington where I sat waiting on the overground for the train to make the journey to Haggerston, my destination. I did not expect the bit of fun that was to come.  The carriage was full of people when a group of teenagers got on.  A girl pointed out to her friend or boyfriend who was wearing a purple shirt and holding a pink one  in his hand.  The former said out loud that she didn't trust him with the purple shirt and asked us all what we thought. One thing led to another and believe it or not after my suggestion, the boy in question took off the purple shirt to loud cries from his fellow passengers. It was a very merry moment; something I think could only happen in London hahaha.</div>

Both Suzy and I were dog-tired that night and not at all hungry. It was that night that I introduced her to Netflix and we would binge watch until the end of the next day, Sunday.  I was pleased to see that with my Spanish account we could see British Netflix content.  I was also jealous that there was much more choice in the UK.  Our first film was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_(film)">Brooklyn</a> about a young Irish girl who emigrates to the US in the 50's. We went to bed before it finished and watched the end on Sunday whilst having our breakfast.</div>

Our next film was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1438216/">Oranges and Sunshine</a> about secret Government backed mass deportations of underprivileged children to Australia and other countries such as New Zealand and South Africa to populate The Empire with white people. The problem was they didn't know where they were going and nor did their parents, some of whom thought they had been adopted in the UK.  I had read the book, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/822539.Empty_Cradles">Empty Cradles</a>, by the social worker Margaret Humphries who set up an association in the 80's to find the "children's" mothers.  The majority of them had been appallingly treated and abused in their countries of destination.   Both Suzy and I were riveted with Oranges and Sunshine, things that were promised to these children to lure them to the "colonies".</div>

After this tragic story it was time for something more light.  We found it in "<i><a href="http://gb.imdb.com/title/tt1837562/">A Royal Night Out</a></i>". This is a comedy based on the true story of the Royal Princesses, Margaret and Elizabeth who persuaded their parents King George VI and their Mother, the Late Queen Mother, to go out and join the crowds on VE day that marked the end of the Second World War. It was a purely beautiful film with a lot of fiction of course but thoroughly entertaining.</div>

Once home and during our dinner we watched our last but one film, "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441953/">Testament of Youth</a>", a tragic love story set in the First World War and based on the autobiography by Vera Brittain who was one of the few women of her times to go to Oxford. She lost both her young husband and brother in the war and also became a nurse not just in London but also in France behind the trenches to be near her brother.  I have since downloaded her book which at the time was a bestseller but found it rather uphill. The film, however, is wonderful.</div>

Our day hadn't finished.  As Suzy would be going back to work the next day, our only time for shopping together would be that afternoon. So off we went to Westfield Shopping Centre at Stratford which is about 50 minutes on the overground but at least there are no changes. Armed with a shopping list we went to Marks and Spencer's which I bet doesn't surprise you.  We also went to Boots, Lakeland (super kitchen store) and the Carphone Warehouse as we both were in dire need of a battery power bank for our mobile phones.  </div>

On Tuesday Suzy went off to work and I was left alone at home with her flat mate Anita. But I had an engagement for lunch.  I was meeting Gill H, my own flat mate at Nottingham University when she was a law student and I a student of Hispanic Studies. We have kept in touch over the years.  We arranged to meet at Spitalfield's market at a fish and chips place, the latter at my request, at <a href="http://poppiesfishandchips.co.uk/">Poppies</a>. We met a little early so as to take a walk around before eating. The last time we had met was for dinner at Suzy's flat in South Bermondsey just over a year ago.</div>

It was built between 1714 and 1729 by Christopher Wren's disciple, Nicholas Hawksmoor. It was one of the first churches to be built as a result of the New Churches Act or Commission.  50 were planned but only 12 were built, 6 by Hawksmoor and they became known as The Queen Anne Churches. The polite reason for their construction was for the increasing population of London but the real reason was to counteract the rising debauchery of those times. That was a nice bit of history, thank you Gill. </div>

The world is very small indeed because it turned out that Gill has been living in Haggerston, around the corner from where Suzy now lives, for 15 years or so. We were both gobsmacked but delighted too and walked home together.  She invited me for a cup of tea at her amazing renovated Georgian house. She lives in the basement which is actually part of the original garden and rents the rest of the house in two flats.  It was so nice to be somewhere so beautiful, clean and swish in Hackney.</div>

My next appointment was meeting Suzy in Tottenham Court Road at Planet Organic, the company she used to work for. Whilst at Tottenham Court I made one last entry into an M+S to get 5 packs of their "essential kitchen wipes" which I can't live without - that's a bit of an exaggeration hahaha. I also got a lovely tin of biscuits for my Father or rather the tin is for me and the biscuits for him.  </div>

Apart from shopping for a few items at Planet Organic we were to meet up with an ex colleague there, Angela who described herself as Suzy's only English friend. I remarked that it was possibly because my daughter lives in a sort of Spanish and other nationality bubble to which Suzy laughed out loud and told me it was the English who don't want to mix with them. That really hurt me. Imagine! Angela, a fellow nutritionist, was a darling and we went to to have a drink at the most delightful place, The Charlotte Street Hotel.  I loved it. Suzy had a gin tonic, Angela a glass or red wine and I had a bottle of vintage English cider.</div>

I spent the morning "chillaxing" and slowly packing and getting ready to go. I ordered an Addison Lee taxi to take me to Victoria and I was at LGW by 3 or so. My flight wasn't until 5.40 which gave me plenty of time to have a late lunch and to read whilst I waited to depart.  Again the flight with Easy Jet was incident free and I was in Madrid by 9.15 p m.  Dear Eladio was there to pick me up and it was great to see him. It was wonderful to be home, to see the dogs and to sleep in my own bed but above all it was wonderful to come home to a super clean house after dirty and grimy London.  I'm not sure Madrid is that much cleaner but I think so; certainly people's houses, that's for sure. </div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Dinner was on the terrace and was thanks to my purchases at M+S. I made a wonderful crab meat salad with avocado and we also ate some of the organic humus I bought at Planet Organic which I must say is the best I have ever tasted. For the record crab meat is my favourite food. Well I love lobster too so they are both in my number one spot hahaha.</span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"> Afterwards it was back to watching House of Cards on Netflix. We are on episode 33 and it seems there are not many left, or are there?</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Friday was a quiet day. I had some work to do; not much but some catching up.  I also did the food shopping with Eladio. There is nothing like that to know you are back home and to your routine which I am of course.  I spent part of the afternoon writing this post until I took a break.  Being Friday we went out for dinner and chose La Txitxarrería where we are always welcomed.  </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">And today is Saturday and joy of joys Olivia is here, although I haven't seen her yet as she arrived late last night.  We haven't  seen her since we went to Montrondo for Santa Marta and I look forward to spending some quality mother and daughter time together.</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Well that's it for this week, or rather the last 10 days.  Now my holidays are over which is rather sad but at least we shall continue to have great weather.</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I hope you enjoy this post and look forward to writing again next week,</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Cheers till then</span><br></br>
