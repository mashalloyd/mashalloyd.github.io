<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Hi everyone,<o:p></o:p></span><br></br>
<br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">This week’s blog post promises to be short as my last entry was just a few days ago and not much has happened since then.<o:p></o:p></span><br></br>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Whilst I am writing this Sunday afternoon, there is a classic tennis match going on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Rafa Nadal is playing Roger Federer in the final of the French Open commonly known as Roland Garros.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>If Nadal wins it will be his 6<sup><span style="font-size: x-small;">th</span></sup> win of this Gran Slam, equaling tennis legend Bjorn Borg’s record but more importantly he will retain his number one status.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>There were fears that Djokovic, the Serbian number two, would win both the title and take the number one spot, but the championship went differently. In the semi-finals Nadal beat Andrew Murray of Scotland and Federer beat Djokovic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Nadal has not had a great season, but now seems to be back in form. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Right now he is leading by 2 sets but I cannot watch as I find the whole thing far too tense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Maybe when I end this post we will know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Right now all I can say is “vamos Rafa”.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br></br>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Wednesday was not a good day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had a headache throughout and also got out of sorts after a botched hair cut at my local hairdresser, basically because Angie who usually cuts it has left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I walked out fuming but also worried the over- zealous Cuban hairdresser, Andrés, would get into trouble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I like to have my hair short at the back and longer at the front but in an ascending way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Andrés wanted to make some minor change at the back of my neck and there must have been some sort of misunderstanding as the end result was not what I wanted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The girls say I look like a mushroom and I suppose I do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I will just have to wait now for it to grow and to look for a new hairdresser.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This, my friends, is what it looks like from the back and I am not happy with it.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br></br>

Now she is home and I have just seen her post in Facebook: “home sweet<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>home”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Oli spent her time in London with some of her beloved Erasmus friends who forged their friendship at Falmouth University in 2008.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She stayed with dear Japanese Shino who I hear is being a little exploited working in a sushi bar in London from 8 in the morning till 12 at night. Sandeep, her Indian friend, came from Plymouth to be with them and they were also joined by Rafa who is doing a masters degree in photography in London.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Definitely missing was Sumit, the other Indian friend who is working on a film in Bollywoood (fame for him soon I hope).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Here is a photo of them together I pinched from someone’s Facebook.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></div><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The highlight of the girly week was lunch with the Nokia girls: Jill, Zenaida, Ana, Susana, Juana and Fátima.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I nearly always arrange these encounters and on Friday we went to <a href="http://www.lavacaargentina.net/categoria/3/21/2/las-rozas">La Vaca Argentina</a> in Las Rozas for our reunion lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Only Jill, Zenaida and Fátima still work at Nokia (Nokia Siemens Networks) but of course, much of our conversation centered on the company’s fate at the moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Last week Nokia for the first time in years issued a profit warning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They are being squeezed at the top end by the likes of Apple and Google (Android) and at the bottom by the cheap Chinese brands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>When we all worked there at the beginning of the last decade Nokia was the jewel in the crown of mobile phones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However Nokia’s downfall should not surprise me at all as I have seen similar movements in the sector happen before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In any case it still has an impact on me because of my emotional involvement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was at times a great company to work for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Sadly that is no longer true and many people I knew no longer work there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></div><br></br>

I am so looking forward to this new trip down memory lane, to my childhood haunts but also to get recharged with some Englishness and some “Yorkshireness” too. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>It’s funny how I used to hate the area when I lived there as a teenager but now I sort of need to go back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I am still hoping to organize a school reunion dinner and really must get down to writing to people this week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Can’t wait to see them all again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>
