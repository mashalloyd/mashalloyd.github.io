Dear all.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
It's a nice change for me to be publishing this week's blog post from "abroad". As you will have gathered from the title I am in Brussels. I came on Wednesday to stay with my great friend Sandra and later we would be joined by our other friend Adele. Sandra, Adele and I are University friends from our time at Nottingham University.  They both studied French and I, as you know, studied Spanish. Sandra lives here outside the capital in a lovely area called Ford Jaco near the Soignes Forest.  She is a communications consultant, a bit like me but specialises more on public speaking. Adele lives in Orleans where she is a University lecturer in English. We were the greatest of friends at University and this friendship has continued some 40 years later. That's what I call real friendship. In the last few years we have met up once or twice a year with and without our partners. This time was to be for the girls only and what a time we are having; much more fun than last Sunday I can tell you.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Last Sunday was busy. While my friend and editor Amanda was restructuring my biography, I was once again adding to it after quizzing my father a bit more on his life. I wonder whether it will ever be ready. I had to rush that morning as at 11 am I had my French lesson and also had to have lunch on the table  by 2 pm for 5 people as Oli and Miguel would be joining us. The cupboards were a bit bare so I had to rush out to buy some provisions, come home, start on lunch preparations and then be ready for my French lesson. Both Oli and I had done our homework on the subjunctive quite well. As soon as the lesson ended I had to rush out again on a mission to help a young girl, Elisa.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
That morning her mother and my new found friend, Joanne, had texted me to say that Elisa's iPhone had been stolen from her handbag at a discotheque in town and could I help her with going and making a police report.  The robbery of mobile phones is rife all around the world. She would need this for the insurance of the phone. I picked up Elisa from her house nearby and off we went to Boadilla del Monte. We got the wrong police station and were sent on foot to the Civil Guard (Guardia Civil). Here we were treated very well but oh my was the process long. I think we sat in the office there for 1.5h but finally came out with the necessary report. I drove Elisa home and got home myself just after 2.30. Thankfully Zena and Oli had come to the rescue about lunch and all was ready when I arrived.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
We hadn't seen Olivia since our trip to Santa Pola and when she left that afternoon I wouldn't see her until I get back from Brussels. We spent some time together, not much, as they went out running in the sun. I preferred to wait for it to cool down. As I waited I added more to the biography after sitting for a while with my father and quizzing him on his favourite books, TV series and films. His favourite Russian author by the way is Chekov and his favourite British author Charlotte Brontë. As to films we didn't get very far as he was never very much into films. His favourite composer is Johan Strauss. He loves his waltzes and so do I.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
As I was updating the biography I got a sudden Airbnb reservation.  A chap from South Carolina but with a Chinese name, Jian Li, had made a reservation for 4 for that night. They were already on their way to our house. That meant we had to wait and would have to skip our walk which was quite annoying. The group, Jian, a young  boy and 2 girls in their 20's arrived shortly afterwards in a great big car with a German number place. Jian was relieved to know I was British and that he wouldn't have any language problems. They all spoke good English but his was American so communication was easy.  He explained he runs a company that sells industrial torches and that the rest of his group were from his team in the company he owns that is based in China. They were on a tour of Europe seeing clients. The girls were very excited as it was their first time in Europe. I settled them in to their rooms and later heard and saw the two men playing on the ping pong table outside. Well, of course they would. I felt a bit bad the table was dusty and the bats and balls rather old. We must invest in some new ones. We didn't see much of them as later they went out to dinner nearby.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
That afternoon, Susan, the Canadian lady who is a friend of my father's long lost cousin, Angela, who my friend Joanne had found for us, sent me an email. It was to enclose a photo of Aunty Angela as I have always called her and who is now approaching 95. I showed the photo to my father without telling him who she was and he said "oh that is Angela!". Isn't that sweet?  Here she is by the way.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The day ended with dinner in the kitchen with Andy our Scottish guest who Eladio chatted to until quite late. I must say we do get on with him. He had been out hiking that day in the mountains outside Madrid. Later we watched our favourite programme of the week "Salvados" where the astute journalist, Jordi Evolé, interviewed the Baroness Thyssen whose real name is Carmen Cervera and who is commonly known as "Tita".  She was once Miss Spain and became the 5th wife of Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Borenmisza, who was one of the biggest art collectors in the world. The interview took place in the Thyssen Museum in Madrid where both Tita and Heinrich had donated their respective collections, more or less free, to the Spanish Government. She is quite a character and we enjoyed the interview.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Monday came and I had lots to do before leaving for Brussels on Wednesday.  Before I could get on with my day I had to see to my group of 4 Airbnb guests from China. I even gave them breakfast. Later I was rewarded with a 5 star review which I reciprocated.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
My biggest task that day was to prepare the master class I have to give to a group of communication managers who work for a big Spanish bank. The date is 13th March, just 2 days after  I will be back from Belgium, thus I had to prepare it before my trip. It took a lot of the morning and a couple of hours in the afternoon. Now I understand teachers. It's not just the hour or so of lessons they have to give, it's all the preparation.  I reckon I took 3 hours to do the work, not counting rehearsing it.  Add an hour to drive to the venue, an hour and a half for the lecture, another hour home and in the end 1.5h turns into more than 7 or 8  hours of one's time. Poor teachers and lecturers. The subject this time was how to  pitch a press release to the media and information vs. publicity. It's a subject which is  right up my street. By about 5.30 pm, I was finished. I had done the power point and all my notes. I felt so relieved and went off with Eladio for our walk with the dogs feeling pleased without that burden on my shoulders.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
There's not much else to report about Monday. On the international scene, Juan Guaido managed to return to Caracas and was not arrested. What's happening in Venezuela is dominating the international news this week.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Tuesday came, the last day at home before heading off to Brussels on Wednesday.  I was up early as usual. With the biography manuscript in my editor Amanda's good hands, I am now working with my friend Andy on the family tree which will also be turned into a book. As we do research on my father's family and ancestry, both the tree and the biography have to be updated. That day, we came up trumps. Via a site called "Find a Grave", Andy found my father's brother, Raymond William Lloyd's grave who died aged 16 of polio.  We were fairly sure it would be at the family church St. Nicholas in Uphill. And yes it is there. But what we didn't know is that my grandfather, my father's father, Revd. John Collins Lloyd, is buried there too. What an amazing find. And how lovely to know they are together. We are now researching to see whether Raymond's mother and Revd. John Collins Lloyd's wife, my grandmother, Dorothy Gertrude Lloyd, née Scull is there too. She has to be. This is the grave which I promise you all I shall visit at the earliest opportunity.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
I wasn't sure whether to tell my father as I know the death of his brother was and is such a big thing for him. However, I did tell him, as I never hide anything from him.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
We still had the mystery of my grandfather's 5th sibling, Owen Noel Lloyd to unravel. We knew from records he existed and was born in 1900 and died in 1916. But that's all we knew. It seemed so strange that my grandfather had  a brother my father never knew of. Later in the week I had a eureka moment. During all my research we had come across a man who lives in the village of Valley in Anglesey, Barry H who is a trustee of the Holyhead Maritime Museum and a journalist.  He had already helped us fill quite a few blanks. Well, blow me, he found Owen's burial and baptism certificates and later the cause of death.  This is young Owen's burial certificate which for me proved the fact that this young boy did once walk on the face of this earth. I am so happy to have discovered his existence.</div>

So I now know he died of TB. </span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">What a sad coincidence that my grandfather lost
his brother aged 16 and then his son , Raymond at the same age. I still cannot
understand why Owen Noel has never been mentioned in my father’s family. It does not make sense. But what a find for my biography and for the family tree. </span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Dear Barry also helped us this week find more ancestors. We knew one of my other grandfather's siblings, William Fox Lloyd had married a woman called Gwendolyn and they had had two girls, Blodwyn and Gwendolyn and that they had lived in Glasgow. My father always talked about his cousins in Glasgow but he hadn't had contact for years and I had never met them. Now Barry has found their surnames and enough details to hopefully find their offspring who would be my second or third cousins. Oh what wonderful research findings. </span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Although I was so absorbed in the research and findings, I had to come back from the past to my real life and had to go and do something so mundane as the food shopping. It's funny but on this journey of mine into the past, the present seems to be of little interest to me. But I went and made my way through the motions, came back and made lunch too. Life continues of course and later in the day we went on our walk. My body was on the walk, my mind was in the past. But I came back to the present to watch my darling daughter Oli on the TV. </span></span></div>

But this one was rather different. She was writing to tell us not to worry if she wasn't available on Thursday. She told us Thursday was "</span><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyepi" style="font-size: 11pt;">Silent Day"</a><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> in Bali. Not available means apparently, no internet, no partying, no reveling, no talking loud, no shops  open, etc. People stay at home to quietly respect the Gods and meditate. This is a Balinese Hindu practice which Suzy and her friends would be respecting on Thursday. Good for them.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I travelled with Ryan Air or should I say Ryan Dare. Flying is not pleasant  these days and even worse with budget airlines. Oh for the days of corporate travel when I used to fly business class. Well never mind, the important thing is the flight was smooth and I landed on time at Brussels airport. My dear dear friend Sandra was there with her dog Barney to pick me up. To be picked up at an airport is very special for me as all my life I have done it alone when arriving from a trip. It was raining when I got there but I didn't give a damn. I was looking forward to 5 days of sheer quality time with my great friends Sandra and Adele and it didn't matter where we were or what the weather was like.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">We were soon back at her gorgeous flat in Fort Jaco in the posh area of Uccle just outside Brussels which is surrounded by a divine forest. And soon we were in her newly refurbished kitchen making a lovely lunch which we had with a glass or red wine. Luckily it didn't give me a headache. In the afternoon she took me to the fruit and veg market in a lovely area called Le Chatlain in the Ixelles district where she first lived when she came to live in Belgium.  Being Carnaval week the centre was not too crowded and we were able to park. It was raining though but I didn't care. I loved the market and we bought lots of fruit at amazing prizes  - like 3 huge mangoes for 5 euros or 10 passion fruit for 3 euros or a kilo of monkey bananas for 2 euros. And the fruit was good. I wanted to buy flowers for Sandra, my host and her dear mother, Magda. This I did at a flower stall where they were selling beautiful tulips. Oh I do love tulips. </span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">It was rather cold and rainy and after exploring the shops where we didn't buy anything, we headed home. We put our feet up, had some wine and some "nibbles" until Magda came to join us for dinner. Sandra made a great pasta dish and we spent a long time after dinner talking about my father and mother's past and then I quizzed Magda on her past, as a survivor of the holocaust in WW2 in Budapest. I really think Magda has to tell her story. She is only 93 and can still be taped. If Sandra doesn't do it, I will one day. What an amazing woman she is.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">We had a lovely quiet breakfast and the day was ours for the taking. I felt great with no house running responsibilities to worry about. It was cold, windy and raining and damned freezing outside. Sandra needed to go to Waterloo, yes the place where the famous battle took place but also now an  upmarket suburb of Brussels. Waterloo is where the ex Catalan President, Carlos Puigdemont lives after fleeing justice in Spain. He broke the law by organising a referendum and other crimes such as the using of public funds to hold it, the encouragement of violence and a long etcetera. He and some of his cronies escaped to Belgium the night after declaring Catalonia a Republic which of course it cannot become unless the whole nation votes. Knowing he would face arrest, he and a few others fled to Belgium where they knew justice is far more lenient while his fellow partners in crime remained in Spain to face the music. Those facing the music in Spain despise his actions. He led them into the mess they are in always telling them there would be no criminal consequences. Well there were and he fled. He went to Belgium where he is now represented by a lawyer who once defended Basque ETA terrorists who had killed people but whom the Belgian law let stay here and refused to extradite them to Spain. Puigdemont who lives off the support of fellow fanatics lives in a splendid 500 square metre mansion which costs 4.400 euros a month. And that's where Sandra drove me to on Thursday morning. I was hoping he would be in and that I could have a chat with the deluded man but I'm afraid he wasn't in. The photo below is of me outside his splendid house which he calls "La Casa de la República" or the House of the Republic. Puigdemont calls it the exiled centre of the Catalan Republic abroad. There is even a plaque that says it. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">I loved the shops on that street, in fact I loved the whole area. We went into quite a lot and I came across a budget Belgian clothes shop called Camaïeu. It was one of those shops you come across and simply seem to like everything. I couldn't buy much as I have very little room in my suitcase. But I did invest in a lovely pair of trousers ("jogpants" here)in a Prince of Wales pattern, a black jumper to wear with them and of course I could not resist a blue and white striped French type nautical jumper once again, as if I didn't already have a huge collection of striped jumpers hahaha. Happy with my purchases, we carried on looking in other shops. I was in search of yellow canvas shoes or trainers to go with a recently purchased yellow puffer jacket I bought in Santa Pola. Yellow is much in fashion now but trainers, called "basket" in French in yellow are not easy to find. But, I found some, a sort of imitation Converse type and I love them. In the shops I was using my now more refreshed French and you know what? I really feel it has come on and I am loving using my French here.</span></div>

The traffic was awful in the afternoon and it was raining cats and dogs but we were on time. It was lovely to see Adele. Now our group was complete. On the way back to Fort Jaco, Adele spotted the Joe Malone shop and we stopped to get her favourite perfume; life basil and mandarin. It's not my favourite. I would have got mine; mint and jasmine except that they no longer make it. It's perhaps a good job they don't as a bottle of 100ml costs 112 euros! Sandra was waiting outside with Barney and I just had to have a photo of my two dear friends together. Here they are, these lovely ladies who I have known since I was 18 in my first term at Nottingham University when we began there in 1976, 43 years ago. But you know what?  When we are together, we feel like young girls again, just less poor hahaha. </span></span></div>

Magda joined us for dinner and wow did we eat a lot. We had focaccia bread with it - naughty but nice and of course we had the cakes after dinner and chocolates too. The wine and chocolate is generally a dynamite combination but I took my alcohol and headache antidote pills and they worked. These were the divine cakes by the way.</span></span></div>

We stocked up on more cakes too hahaha. We were in need of a walk afterwards, as was Barney, Sandra's little terrier who is the centre of attention and an adorable little dog. My friend is so lucky to live on the doorstep of the lovely "Foret de Soignes", a huge forest surrounding parts of the outskirts of the city. I have been on walks there on all of our visits here and love the place. </span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14.66px;">Sandra took us to her weekly "stretching" class.  I don't really like doing gym as my exercise is walking. Thus my expectations were low. But you know what? I ended up loving every minute. It was a slow relaxing hour of gentle stretching to beautiful Indian music. I couldn't believe the hour was up when everyone stood up. Feeling great afterwards, we headed to the hammam area, the spa part of the gym which is a paradise if you like spas as I do. There is a great big jacuzzi with the most tremendously strong jets of water where we sat in warm water relaxing and feeling pampered. Pampered was the word to describe our next activity. We went into a silent room where we lay on hot stone beds. That was the most wonderful experience. Me, Masha, the hyperactive and rather exhausted person I am recently because of all this work on my father's 100th, was finally able to wind down and just enjoy the heat and stillness of the place. I fell asleep and when I woke up I wondered if I might invest in a similar hot stone bed for my room in Madrid. From there I wondered to the giant saunas and steam baths. You could choose to go to a 70 or 80 degree one and I chose the latter. It was a huge beautiful sauna room and reminded me of my times with Nokia when I visited Finland a lot and went to sauna as often as I could. From the very hot sauna we went to swim in heated water in the outdoor pool in brilliant sunshine. It's a pity my phone was in the locker and I couldn't take photos of my time at Sandra's most wonderful sports' centre. If I had a place like that near where I live, I think I would be going every day. We came out 3 hours later feeling great. The time there had done me the world of good.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14.66px;">We walked back to Sandra's luxury flat - everything in Sandra's life is luxurious (haha), even the name of the complex she lives in, "Villa Hermes", to make what we said would be a "quick lunch", or just a bite. Of course it wasn't. It was 3 pm and we were hungry and then there were the Belgian cakes to eat afterwards. The plan for the afternoon was to visit a museum but in the end the three of us decided to stay at home, relax and enjoy being together. Later I crashed out on the sofa and amazingly slept for about 2 hours. I woke up feeling so good. I needed the sleep.  When I woke up and after a cup of decaf tea, I rang Oli who was with the girls' bosom friend from childhood, Copi. I wished them a happy women's day. It was lovely to talk to the two of them. I wanted to ring Suzy too but of course by that time it was too late to call Bali as it's 7 hours ahead. I was wondering how her "silent day" had gone. </span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14.66px;">That night Sandra had a table booked at a Lebanese restaurant in the city near the famous Grand Place. Called Al Barmaki, it was a very authentic place. We did as most people do when they eat Middle Eastern food and that is to  order the "mezze", a little bit of everything on the menu. It would end up being too much of course.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14.66px;">Saturday of course was International Women's Day and we toasted to it when the wine arrived. It was rather fitting that I spent women's day in the company of my two best women friends. In Madrid for the 2nd year in a row there was a strike with large demonstrations in  Madrid and Barcelona. Even nuns took part - good for them. There is still much to strike about my friends, starting with equal pay and of course violence to women, the scourge of our times. We have it better than our grandmothers and mothers but there is still a long way to reach equality with men. There is I promise you and I have experienced it as I worked as a woman in the corporate world which is still totally male dominated. So yes, we toasted to Women's Day and of course to our friendship.</span></span></div>

I was stunned then and it never fails to impress. What a beautiful place. We bumped into some friendly Indians from Kerala and Sandra being Indian born immediately agreed to take their photo in the square. They then took ours. Of course afterwards we spent quite a while talking to them. They were a lovely group of people. We later remarked what lovely people the Indians are in general, most possibly because of their family values.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14.66px;">We drove home for my dear girlfriends to have some champagne - I couldn't as it would probably have killed me. Soon, I, at least was in my pyjamas and the three of us were in front of the "telly" watching the BBC with a bowl of delicious Belgian chocolates in front of me. The chocolates would kill me too but I couldn't resist. We watched part of a film called "Made in Dagenham". It was quite fitting for it to be broadcast on Women's Day as it was about the women's strike at a Ford factory in the 60's for equal pay for women. I watched it and dozed off, watched a bit again and it was just my sort of film. I must see it in its entirety. </span></span></div>

How lovely to be with my friends and with no domestic duties. Breakfast was a leisurely event after which I rang my dear daughter Suzy in Indonesia. Her so called "Silent Day" was over and she was now reachable. I wanted to talk to her to try and make her come for my father's 100th birthday. She was coming originally in June to stay a few months. She agreed immediately so now his day will be made even more special by her presence. I could not envisage that day without her. </span></span></div>

I had had my fill of course in Waterloo. Here Adele and Sandra tried on lots of tops such as these.</span></div>

We got off at the Place Royale and it was very cold and windy. My dear friends who are much more into art, culture and theatre than I am were very keen to visit an exhibition taking place at the big church in the square called Revolutions. It's about the Swinging Sixties and ends today. I think I was put off by all the pop culture around that time as I was influenced by my father's dislike of it. I also felt very trapped inside as I often do in places like Ikea so I  left and went outside to kick my heels while my friends enjoyed the exhibition. It was cold and wet and I had spied the MIM (Museum of Musical Instruments) across the square,  a lovely art deco building which has a roof terrace restaurant on the top floor with a panoramic view of Brussels. It had been recommended to me by my friend Joanne. I loved the views and I loved the place.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14.66px;">It was a very touristy thing to do but I didn't care. We had a sort of showman chocolate expert to entertain us and entertain us he did. It was like being back at school but studying your favourite subject hahaha. Here is the guy showing us the pods where the cocoa beans grow inside something called pulp which is what contains the "drug" in chocolate called "theobromine".</span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14.66px;">He explained that it was this ingredient which makes one feel happy. Now i know why I love chocolate so much as it is supposed to make one happy. It always makes me happy and most women too I suspect. We got to sample some of the pralines, etc and even a new type of chocolate that has just come into the market, "ruby chocolate". It was all delicious. Later I would buy a few slabs and boxes for an extortionate tourist price, silly me.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14.66px;">The session went on for far too long and we had to go. Sandra had to be back to make sure her mother was alright and to take the dog for a walk. On our way back, Adele wanted to visit the Japanese Zara like store called Uniqlo. I was sort of interested but not as much as her. However, l did buy two lovely long sleeved tops, one yellow and one striped - my trademark. It was cold and dark as we left and difficult to find a taxi. In the end we walked and walked and walked until we finally found a tram to take us home. The three of us were tired but the day hadn't ended. </span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14.66px;">Once back in Sandra's area of Uccle, she rushed off to get the dog while Adele and I went into her local supermarket, "Delhaize" to get some things for dinner. I love that supermarket but then I suppose most people like other countries' supermarkets. Here we stocked up mostly on wine and more chocolate hahaha. Thank goodness i am going home tomorrow and from Tuesday onward I shall be back to my normal eating regime.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14.66px;">When Magda left - she lives in the flat above Sandra's - we lay on the sofas to watch the end of the film we had started the night before, "Made in Dagenham". I would have loved to watch it to the end but I'm afraid I fell asleep. I was shattered and so was Adele. Thus I was in bed by about 11 pm and slept soundly until this morning at 5.15. Yes my friends I got up today at the unearthly hour of 5.15!</span></span></div>
