<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Hello
everyone,</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">This has been
an exciting and very tiring week.  I love
travelling but the getting up at the crack of dawn and the hassle in air travel
these days, especially if the latter doesn’t go as smoothly as planned, really
make me tired.  This is probably because
of my age.  Well I will, after all, be
reaching the grand old figure of 55 this coming week.  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The week
started off with a very quiet Monday.  Of
note that day I had lunch with my friends Julio and Fátima to celebrate her
birthday.  As tradition dictates, we did
so at one of our favourite restaurants, <a href="http://www.elbuey.es/">El Buey</a> in nearby Boadilla del Monte, a
great little place that serves the best steak in the area.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Tuesday was a
busier day.  I was up early to have my
hair done at Marco Aldany, the hairdresser I go to these days.  Unfortunately Cristina, who does a great job
with my hair, wasn’t there so I got a slightly different style this time.  I realised it was not quite what I wanted
when Susana, my eldest daughter, observed I looked a little like Margaret
Thatcher!  Then I was off to the office
for the weekly management team meeting where I am always painfully aware that I
am the only woman member but certainly not an “Iron lady” although I sometimes
have to appear so in this very male dominated sector that I work in, full of
telecommunications engineers.  It’s not a
career I would ever have chosen, but it’s the sector I am in for good and for
bad.  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">On Wednesday I
was up again at 6 in the morning to leave for the airport to catch the only
direct flight to Stockholm which leaves just after 10.  I coincided with Olivia, my youngest
daughter, who gets up at that time everyday to go to the TVE morning programme
she works for called La Mañana de la 1. 
I thought that if it made me tired just to get up so early only
occasionally, how tough it must be for her to do it five days a week and felt
sorry for her.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I boarded the
plane with the rest of the management team, destination Stockholm, the
headquarters of <a href="http://www.teliasonera.com/">TeliaSonera</a>, the Scandinavian telephone operator who own Yoigo
with a 76% share.  We were to take part
in the annual management team meeting together with our counterparts from the
Nordic and Baltic countries beginning the next morning.  But first we were to have a tight schedule of
meetings after our arrival, including a presentation from my former boss in
Nokia, Thomas J.  who now works as the
head of external relations in TeliaSonera. 
Talk about a small world!  We also
had a meeting at the world HQ of a Swedish company I admire enormously, <a href="http://www.spotify.com/uk/about-us/press/background-info/">Spotify</a>
which I was much looking forward to.  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Europe this
week has being going through a cold spell so I had packed accordingly and was
glad I had taken a thick coat and warm winter head gear as it was well below
10ºc throughout our stay and snowing most of the time.  It also gets dark very early; something I
would find very difficult to have to face if I lived here.  Thankfully I live in a country with probably
the best climate in Europe.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">We arrived in
the early afternoon and lunch was a sausage in the street, something I don’t
think I have done since my Inter rail days as a teenager when that was all I
could afford.  My empty stomach though,
was very happy to digest a hot and spicy, Swedish sausage appropriately called
“Stockholm”.  Dinner was a much finer
affair at one of the city’s best restaurants, <a href="http://www.wedholmsfisk.se/Home.htm">Wedholm Fisk</a> where the fish was
out of this world.  It is certainly a
place to go back to if I could ever afford it.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">FISK
RESTAURANT</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I nearly froze
in the ten minute walk back in wind and snow and was happy to return to my warm
room at the <a href="http://www.scandichotels.se/Hotels/Countries/Sweden/Stockholm/Hotels/Scandic-Sergel-Plaza/">Scandic Sergel Plaza hotel</a> in the centre of town.  Warm, was actually the only saving grace,
apart from the location of the hotel which is soulless, drab and quite downturn
for sophisticated Stockholm.  I remarked
to my colleagues, who totally agreed, that the rooms reminded me of prison
cells. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The next day,
I was up before seven as I had to attend an 8 o’clock conference call from my
room about the financial results which TeliaSonera had published that
morning.  The news was good for
Yoigo.  We had reached the 3 million
customer mark and had not only remained EBITDA positive, but reached the cash
flow positive objective for the last quarter of 2011.  Results days are always stressful for me, because
we have to get the information ready in Spanish to send out to the press as
early as possible, be prepared for all sorts of questions throughout the day,
as well as inform the staff in more informal terms.  That meant that breakfast, usually my most important
meal of the day, had to be sacrificed. 
In any case the breakfast room at the Scandic resembled feeding time at
the zoo, with not much on offer and a huge flow of people fighting for the
coffee machine and bread table, so I didn’t miss much.  The next day I was rewarded for my work with
all the main newspapers reporting positively on Yoigo’s results.  I was especially pleased with the coverage in
one of our top newspapers, El Mundo where we were included in one of the main
“ups” of the day in the “vox populi” section of page 2 as you can see here, if
you can read Spanish, a most prestigious position to be in and something no
advertising money could ever buy.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The conference
started at 10 o’clock and was held in the cultural heart of Stockholm, bang in
the middle of the city.  The building is
called <a href="http://www.kulturhuset.stockholm.se/default.asp?id=5661">Kulturhuset</a> (literally "culture house") and is full of people enjoying the library, eating Swedish
cakes or going to the theatre.  </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">We on the
other hand were to go through a day of presentations.  The first, to my surprise, was absolutely
fantastic.  We had the privilege of
seeing and hearing Sweden’s next export after Abba and Stieg Larsson, talk to
us about the future.  The man’s name is
<a href="http://magnuslindkvist.com/">Magnus Lindqvist</a> and he is truly inspiring. 
He calls himself a trendspotter and futurologist.  He is also a fantastic speaker.  I have just ordered his book from
Amazon.co.uk called “Everything we know is wrong”.  I look forward to be being just as
entertained as listening to him.  Not for
him the trends of today, such as gadgets and fashion items that come and go,
but to quote him “the more important deeper slower moving stuff” that you never
really see coming.  He makes you stop and
think and he certainly made an impression on me.  He is apparently a celebrity speaker, so if
you ever get the chance to listen to him, grab it.  Magnus Lindqvist was definitely the best item
on the whole agenda of our two day conference in Stockholm.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The rest of
the day was like any typical corporate management or sales convention, nothing
out of the ordinary.  The best part for
me is always mingling with colleagues from other countries and getting to know
new people and thankfully there was plenty of that.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The evening
ended with a dinner party and awards and I was happy to see my colleague Urban
get a prize for the best growth in mobile date. 
I went to bed as soon as it had finished though as I had another early
wake up the next day as the second day conference was to start just after
8.  I had a terrible night as the
television kept switching on automatically. 
In the end it seemed that the TV wake-up call had been programmed various
times during the night and the only way of stopping it was pulling out all the
cables.  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">This week’s
visit to Stockholm was so busy I hardly had time for shopping.  My only trip to the shops was during lunch on
Friday when I crossed the snowy square to Lindex, the Swedish low cost women’s
fashion store.  Oli had asked me to bring
back a Swedish woolen cardigan.  So I
braved the weather and with an eye on my watch, made a dash into this lovely
store.  Unfortunately there were no
winter clothes left on sale, so I had to make do with a quick choice from the
new Spring collection.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Normally when flying
out of Stockholm, we, or I, take the only direct flight to Madrid which leaves
just before 3 and gets you to Madrid airport just after 7.  However, as we wanted to stay to the end of
the conference which was finishing around 3, we had been booked on a flight via
Amsterdam, leaving the Swedish capital at 17.15 and arriving in Madrid just
before midnight, a long haul.  We were
not lucky as the flight to Amsterdam was cancelled because of snow at Schipol
airport and that is where our adventure began. 
KLM booked us into the SAS flight to Frankfurt leaving at 16.40 from
where we would have a two hour wait before taking the last flight to
Madrid.  Check in and going through
security was nerve wrecking as we were very pressed for time.  At the last minute my colleagues were already
on board and I joined the queue after a quick loo stop only to be told the
plane was full and overbooked.  I
couldn’t believe what I was hearing, “you mean I cannot get on the plane?”  There was a lot of discussion and mysterious punching
into the computer by the SAS hostesses. 
I was desperate as I didn’t want to spend another night in Stockholm and
most of the following day getting home. 
And then came, my salvation.  A
Russian gentleman offered me his seat and told me he would get on the next and
last flight to Frankfurt as that was his final destination, unlike mine.  I accepted very gratefully and later remarked
to my neighbour from the horrible middle seat I was sitting on with my cabin suitcase
under my legs because the plane was so full, how generous the man had been.  My German fellow passenger then told me that
the kind Russian man would have been compensated with 150 euros for taking the
next plane.  So, maybe he wasn’t so
generous after all but I can tell you I wouldn’t have stayed for 500, so am
still grateful for his gesture. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The nightmare
didn’t quite finish there, as we had another flight to catch in Frankfurt which
at one stage we also thought might not be leaving.  But finally it did and again I was squashed
into a middle seat, a position in an airplane that I always try to avoid.  We arrived at Barajas after an awful journey
home well after midnight and I did not get home till half past one in the
morning.  I swear I will only ever get
the direct flight back from Stockholm whether that means I have to leave in the
middle of a conference or not.  I also
swear that I will never ever go to the end of a queue to get on a plane as I
have learned the hard way that it might be overbooked and if you are at the end
you are more than likely liable to be left behind as I nearly was if it hadn’t
been for the help of one Russian gentleman. 
Thank you whoever you are.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The only thing
that kept me going through both flights was the fascinating book I was reading,
<a href="http://www.amazon.es/Swim--Part-Goldfish-Bowl/dp/0755317084/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328441078&amp;sr=8-4">“A swim on part in the goldfish bowl”</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Thatcher">Carol Thatcher</a>’s biography of her very famous
Mother, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, Britain’s first and only woman prime minister.  I had ordered it eagerly after watching Meryl
Streep in The Iron Lady, a role she may well win an Oscar for.  </span></div>

However, she will most definitely go down in history for her role in
British politics, whether you like her or not. 
In fact, after reading the book I learned that beneath the iron lady
veneer, there is a person with a far bigger heart than I could ever have
imagined.  I was also very interested to
read about her consort, Dennis Thatcher, a bit of a joke figure in my
time.  But as I read more about him, it
is quite clear, that without DT as she called him, Margaret Thatcher could
never have done the job she did.  I have
now ordered Carol Thatcher’s biography of her Father called <a href="http://www.abebooks.co.uk/Below-Parapet-Thatcher-Carol-Harper-Collins/1304554809/bd">“Below the Parapet”</a>
as the subject is interesting me so much, I have even gone one step further and
ordered her mother’s  autobiography, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Downing-Street-Years-Margaret-Thatcher/dp/0006383211">“TheDowning Street Years”</a>.  After all, she
governed in amazing times and they were the times I was often too young or too uninterested
to appreciate when she was in Government.. 
So, Margaret Thatcher will continue in my life for the next few weeks
and of course, in my memory for ever.  It
is very sad that she herself, such a dominating and clever woman, no longer remembers
very much, not even that her dearest Dennis is no longer alive.  Carol has to remind her time and again and
each time she is told, the Iron Lady, no longer made of iron, has to go through
the sorrow of hearing the news.  One of
the times, she poignantly asks her daughter, “were we all there (at the
funeral) for him?”.  This is indeed not a
very nice ending for such a brilliant life.   My Father is reading it now and no doubt he
will enjoy it more than me.  He and my
Mother were great fans of Margaret Thatcher, but I think even they had had
enough when towards the end of her 11 years at Downing Street she said the
famous “we shall go on and on and on”.  </span></div>

Saturday and it was real tonic to spend it at home with the family after such a
tiring week.  For the first time in ages,
we had lunch together.  We were joined by
Juli and Gaby and it was a joyful meal.  There
was time to relax, to be with the dogs, go for our walk and there was even time
to go out to the cinema.  Eladio and I
were waiting for the latest Iciar Bollain (Spanish woman film director) film to
come out entitled <a href="http://www.katmandulapelicula.com/en/index.html">“Kat(h)mandu, a mirror to the sky”</a> and luck had it that the
premiere was this week, so we jumped at the chance of seeing it.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I didn’t know
really what it was about but had seen the trailer and was keen to see a film
about a country that is close to our heart. Even though we only spent three
days there on our trip to India for our 25<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary in
December 2008 and January 2009, we fell in love with Nepal and its people.  I wrote three posts on our unforgettable
journey there and actually they are among the top read posts in my blog.  I am honoured to say that thousands of people
have read them.  If you want to read them
here they are (<a href="http://mashalloyd.blogspot.com/2009/01/varanasi-to-kathmandu-santoshs-story.html">first</a>, <a href="http://mashalloyd.blogspot.com/2009/01/bhaktapur-city-dictionary-episode-and.html">second</a>, <a href="http://mashalloyd.blogspot.com/2009/01/getting-out-of-nepal-cat-and-mouse.html">third</a>).  In the second post I tell of the story of three boys for whom we bought an
English Nepalese dictionary in Bhaktapur so I was delighted to see that some
parts of the film had been filmed there.  Other famous spots we had seen also come out
in the film and watching it yesterday certainly took us all the way back there,
reminding us of our wonderful trip of a lifetime.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The film is
about a young Spanish teacher, Laia who goes out to work as a teacher in
Kathmandu. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">She is helped
by a Nepalese young woman, Sharmila, also a teacher, and together they set up a
school in the slum district.  They are
faced with insurmountable problems and the cultural obstacles are many.  Some of the characters, in this part real,
part fictional film, can only be people off the streets in the Kathmandu Valley
and I take my hat off to Iciar Bollain for this masterpiece.  I fell in love with the people in the film
and find it hard to forget Sharmila, the teacher bent on having a son to make
her family happy, Tsering, the young man from a remote village who agrees to
marry Laia in a marriage of convenience, but asks her what will happen if they
fall in love, Bimala, the girl so untouchable she has no name and finally
clever little Kushila who is sold by her parents and sent to work in a brothel
in India and her journey back.  They all
tore at my heart strings as did the film. 
It is not a film with a happy ending. 
The story it tells is taken from real life, some of it happy, a lot of
it sad but a real eye opener to the clash of cultures.  How can we, or Laia, understand how a young
girl, for instance, is put into a dark room on her own for 10 days when she
reaches puberty, so that the light she sees when she leaves it at the end of
the 10 days will guide her for the rest of her life?  In short, the film had me crying from the
middle to the end and I shall probably never forget it.  It brought back memories of our visit there
and has triggered in me the wish to return. 
I hope one day we will. 
Meanwhile, if you get the chance, I cannot recommend this film more highly.</span></div>
