Dear friends and readers.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I hope you have had a great Christmas and are enjoying the seasonal good spirit. After all the preparations, it seems so unfair Christmas is now over but of course there is still New Year and in our case, Kings' Day, to celebrate.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

Last Sunday we saw the end of Storm Elsa. Last Sunday was also the first day of Winter but it wasn't too cold here and Eladio and I got our walk in that morning. There was zero sign of Suzy all weekend as she was out and about with friends. But we did have the pleasure of the company of Miguel, Oli and little Elliot. </div>

He's not so little anymore I can tell you. If last week I wrote that he weighs a whopping 6.2 kilos, we measured him that day and found he is 68 cm tall which is an increase of 15 cm since he was born on 17th September. He is now the size of a 6 month old baby yet he is only 3 months old. Hopefully he will take after my dear brother George who was slender and tall at 6 ft. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
We had lunch together and then Oli and her little family went out to do more Christmas shopping. Thankfully I had  all of mine. When they were back it was play time with Elliot and then time for his bath. I do love bathing him with Oli. We made dinner later which we had in the luxury of our own company with no guests and in our festive dining room. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

<div style="text-align: justify;">
We had hoped to become millionaires or at least win a decent amount of money in the Spanish Christmas lottery called "El Gordo" (the fat one). With a total of 2.2 billion euros it is considered the world's richest for the total prize money won. Well we didn't yet again but many people did and it's always fun to watch them celebrating on the news. One of Miguel's TVE colleagues in Valencia, a reporter called Natalia, went a bit crazy reporting from San Vicente del Raspeig (Alicante) claiming live on TV that she herself had won a ticket from the top prize, "El Gordo" itself. She shouted out to the studio she wouldn't be going to work the next day. Her reporting was over the top. But it later transpired she had made it up. She had not won the lottery. Miguel knew that as her cameraman, a friend and colleague of his, told my son-in-law, she had made no mention of it to anyone until she was live on camera. She quickly became trending topic on twitter and then she was found out and RTVE had to issue a statement to say she hadn't won the top prize of El Gordo but a smaller one of 5000 euros. Miguel told me there is no 5000 euro prize in the Christmas lottery and that she was making that up too to save face I suppose.  The story went viral and was later reported on all around the world even in The Sun and The Washington Post. You can see the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/12/24/spanish-tv-reporter-quits-on-air-after-winning-lottery-but-only-wins-small-prize/">video in this article</a>. Her behaviour and downright lying are unthinkable for a journalist especially from the country's top broadcaster.<br></br>

If she worked for a private  broadcaster no doubt she would have been fired there and then. I just hope her conscience makes her reflect on her own stupidity. What a silly thing to do. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
So no we didn't become rich overnight and once again comfort ourselves saying we have won our own lottery with little Elliot and that we have all we need in life. No complaints compared to so many other people in the world.  Later in the week we were pleased to find out that we had in fact won just a little money, 160 euros, which at least saw the return of some of what we spent. But it would not last either as my husband immediately spent the winnings on the next lottery draw, "El Niño" which is said has more possibilities for winning. I hope so otherwise we have just thrown our money away hahaha. </div>

Monday came, 23rd December, just 2 days to Christmas. With  the present shopping out of the way, I turned my hand to all the preparations for our festive meals. First things first though and Eladio rang a few garages to see whether the Volvo could be mended as soon as possible and I rang my lovely dentist, Dr. Garralda, to see if he could fit in me for some emergency treatment for my broken tooth.  All this went on as our daughters and Miguel had their breakfast. I love seeing both girls together with their son and nephew and had to get this morning photo.<br></br>

I got an appointment at 12.30. In between time Eladio and I went out to do the food shopping, well some of it as we would have to go out again the next day. Thankfully the tooth was ok, it just needed filing and I was out by 1. I rushed home to see to our lunch which had been cooking in my absence; chickpea and meat stew.<br></br>
<br></br>
In my absence, Oli had dressed little Elliot in the Santa outfit I got him at H&M and he looked a treat. Here are mother and son together with him in the lovely red outfit.<br></br>

It was Eladio who took the best photo of Elliot posing in the outfit on the sofa in our study. I liked it so much I turned it into yet another Christmas framed photo. Doesn't he look lovely?<br></br>

We were all together for lunch but all did different things in the afternoon. Oli, Miguel and little Elliot had a siesta or I imagine they tried to have one, Suzy did some of her evaluations and Eladio and I went on our walk. By then storm Elsa had gone and the sun shone that day as it would all through Christmas. That really cheered me up as non stop rain and wind last week tended to get me down.<br></br>
<br></br>
I came home to get out the lobster and giant prawns from the deep freeze for dishes I would make for Christmas Eve. I also made the base of the trifle for our dessert on Christmas Eve. I took a quick look before we went to bed and it seemed as though the jelly hadn't set which worried me. Thankfully the next day it was all jelled and ready for the toppings.  I then set about making a simple dinner. Making dinner for 5 is more time consuming than for 2 but oh what joy to be around the dining room table all together again and looking forward to Christmas. We stayed up quite late, sitting in our festive lounge until it was time for bed.<br></br>
<br></br>
Tuesday, Christmas Eve, came and I was awake early at 5.30 already thinking about all the things I had to do for our special evening meal. As soon as I had had my coffee, I finished making the trifle and it looked a treat as you can see in the photo below.<br></br>

We joined the girls, Elliot and Miguel for breakfast and then we all went off to do different things. Suzy had to give her lessons and Oli and her family went for a lovely sunny walk in Boadilla. Eladio and I went out on final errands for Christmas. First we went to the post office to pick up a parcel and were gutted to see it was closed. We then made our way to Carrefour Market to pick up a few last things for our dinner that night and lunch on Christmas Day. We also went to our local bakery, Alverán to get the croissants and pastries for Christmas Day breakfast. There we had a coffee and it was then I realised that Eladio was wearing slippers and had forgotten to put his shoes on. It was such a funny moment I had to record it to share with you. Oh my husband does live in the clouds sometimes, hahahaha.<br></br>

We came home to unload everything, see to the lunch (leftovers for everyone) and then went out on our walk again in glorious sunshine. I came home to finish making the potato salad I had started on very early that morning. We always make it for Christmas Eve as one of the dishes and it is my mother's recipe or actually her father's as she always used to tell me. Looks good eh?<br></br>

Lunch was a family affair again as Oli and her family had come to stay over the festive period. We all had  a tipple of our favourite Juan Gil wine; well Oli had just a sip, followed of course by more Spanish turrón. Then it was time for a short siesta. I was too excited to sleep and kept thinking of all the things I had make for our dinner. In our family we follow the Spanish tradition of a special meal on Christmas Eve and the English tradition of a proper Christmas lunch. There was lots to prepare and I got the help of Zena, our Ukrainian home help who takes over from Lucy when she has time off. Zena celebrates Russian Christmas on 7th January so doesn't mind taking over on the 24th and 25th December. She also contributed to the meal by making her daughter Oxana's courgette blini concoction which Suzy and I had first tried at the cousinade this year (Oxana works on and off for my cousin Zuka). This is it:<br></br>

The staple dishes are always potato salad, bacon rolls, perushki (Russian pasties) and lobster salad. But this year we added a Moroccan touch by ordering falafel, humus and "pastille" (Pastela) a flaky chicken and almond tart, from the El Tuareg restaurant in Villaviciosa. The food came with traditional flat bread and unfortunately at one stage it was within the dogs' reach and they ate nearly all of it hahahahaha. Zena helped me lay the table and peel things, Oli made the bacon rolls and Suzy was in charge of the turrón sweet tray.<br></br>

This year my father preferred to skip  the big meal on Christmas Eve. After all he is now 100 and no doubt it would have been too much for him but we missed him. When little Elliot and I were dressed in our Christmas outfits I went down to his room to say goodnight and give him a kiss. He was delighted.<br></br>
<br></br>
Soon the table was groaning with delicious food which no doubt would last us days. Here it is looking similar to other years except for the Moroccan food.<br></br>

We had made far too much food, enough for a meal three times over but that's no problem as it would mean I wouldn't have to cook for a few days hahahaha.<br></br>
<br></br>
The meal was made complete with crackers and party poppers. Later after we helped Zena clear up, we moved to the lounge to sit by the fire. By then we had taken off our far too warm Christmas outfits. We watched a bit of a silly TV show with lots of comedy acts. Two of them had us in stitches so it was worth it. Then it was to bed at around 11 when most people in Spain would probably only be into their second course.<br></br>
<br></br>
Eladio's last task of the day was to place the girls' stockings outside their rooms. The girls are now 34 and 35 but still get stockings. Next year, when he is old enough, Elliot will get one too.<br></br>
<br></br>
I was awake at just after 5 on Christmas morning but forced myself to go back to sleep. I finally got out of bed at just before 6.30. While everyone was asleep and as soon as I had drunk my first cup of coffee, I laid the table for a festive family breakfast where we would gather for the first of the many events of the most special day of the year.<br></br>
<br></br>
Suzy's day started when she was woken up by little Elliot. By then Oli had already opened her stocking and soon it would be Suzy's turn. But first Elliot's aunt wanted some special time with him. It was as if he was her first and biggest present of the day.<br></br>

The stockings were knitted by my mother for her granddaughters when they were children. Next year Elliot will have his own, already bought by Suzy for him and personalised by Etsy.<br></br>
<br></br>
By just after 9 am we were all gathered in the dining room for a very large breakfast comprising largely of the most delicious pastries, mostly mini croissants which we all love. Here we are about to start.<br></br>

After the breakfast and in line with the traditions passed on to me by my father's mother, it was time to gather around the tree. To the accompaniment of Christmas carols we would spend the next hour and a half opening all our presents. I think I have written before that we always go more for quantity more than quality although each one of us gets a main gift.  In keeping with a new tradition of ours, I asked my son-in-law, Miguel to take the annual photo of my husband and I (to quote the Queen hahahaha) for which we always dress up and for which Eladio always wears a bow tie in which he looks most dapper.<br></br>

It was of course his first Christmas but as he is only 3 months old I suppose he won't have noticed much. He got lots of clothes and a lovely first eating set from Suzy from Zara Home for when he starts on purées in a few months time. I especially love the festive outfit I Eladio and I got him from Zara in which he too looks dapper and is also wearing a bow tie like his grandfather.  Later I took a video of him in his new suit which included a waistcoat and the bow tie. Oh how smart he looks and oh how happy he is in the video. Watch out for Suzy's famous last words in the video which you can see <a href="https://youtu.be/Q85u_0lHz_E">here</a>.<br></br>

I had to have a Christmas day photo with my father too. I remarked that I hoped he would be with us for many more Christmases to come. I cannot ever envisage Christmas without him, as, after all, every one of my Christmas days, except for one when I was in Mexico in 1978, were spent with him. Here it is and I shall treasure it.<br></br>

When all the presents had been opened and everyone had gone off to do their own thing, it was my responsibility to go into the kitchen and start on the Christmas day lunch. Thankfully I had Zena to help me and she peeled the potatoes and laid the table. I was not at all hungry and found the task in front of me a bit uphill. I would have far preferred to go out for a walk but we would have to leave that to the afternoon. I had to have a full roast with all the trimmings for 6 people on the table by 2 pm. I did it of course and by then we were all hungry again hahahaha. Here is my father waiting at the head of the table.<br></br>

After we had all enjoyed our meal it was time for the Christmas pudding which we all love except for Oli who doesn't like it. I wish I didn't either as it makes me so full hahaha.<br></br>
<br></br>
The fun didn't end there. There were still the crackers to come, some John Smith ones I read the Queen has every year. The exception is that she puts in expensive presents. My poor dear father mistook a mini sellotape dispenser for a chocolate and automatically put it in his mouth. Thankfully Zena noticed and removed it immediately hahaha. My father loves chocolates, as do I, and to quote Zena "he eats anything". It was  funny but rather a dangerous moment. We soon got over it when we tried out a 6 hand cracker I had ordered on line. Out of it appeared all sorts of items we later wore for a picture, such as moustaches, lips, glasses etc, all made of paper and not doubt made in China. Here we are with them on in another photo of all of us together.<br></br>

As we were preparing to take my father down to his room in his wheelchair we all wished him a Merry Christmas once again. He said a few words, rare for him, and treasured by us all. He thanked us for all the details and reminisced on Christmas as a child at home. He said he didn't think he and Mummy celebrated it much but I reminded him that we did, especially at his parents' house when George and I were children. He was very thankful for a lovely Christmas and we are very thankful that he is still with us today.<br></br>
<br></br>
We all chilled out afterwards. Eladio and I slept while Suzy and Oli were with the baby. At 5.30 we all went for a well needed walk to work "the turkey" off and of course all the chocolates hahaha. Here we are in a selfie on the walk. It was crisp but sunny and I ended up taking my coat off.<br></br>

Just as we arrived home, Miguel was back from lunch with his family and we all gathered around the fire in the TV, library or cat lounge as it is alternately called. It was then that we thought up a video to make to send to Amanda (my oldest friend) and her family who had sent us one that morning. So with Miguel as the cameraman and Oli and Suzy the choreographers, we made one sending greetings to each member of my friend's family. Oh what a laugh it was and it needed a few takes I can tell you. You can see it on my You Tube channel <a href="https://youtu.be/e3EeVBsicl0">here</a>.<br></br>
<br></br>
It was about 8 pm by then and I couldn't believe it when the younger generation started talking about food. I really didn't think I could get a morsel past my lips but I did of course. There is an expression in Spanish we often use which says "comer y rascar, cuestión de empezar". It means "eating and scratching is a question of starting" except it sounds better in Spanish as it rhymes. I let them get on with preparing the dinner which of course was made up of Christmas Eve leftovers and told them I was on kitchen strike as I had done all the cooking. Thus there was limited service (hahaha) which was quite noticeable but for once I didn't care if the table wasn't laid properly or if there weren't enough glasses, etc.<br></br>
<br></br>
Later we gathered around the fire in the TV lounge and watched the end of the news. I had missed The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgvZnxNAThM">Queen's speech</a>, officially known as "The Queen's Christmas broadcast" which I watched on Boxing Day the next morning. I have a lot of respect for the 93 year old monarch whose year, like mine and many other's, has been bumpy.  Her very first broadcast was made and televised in 1957, coincidentally the year I was born.<br></br>

We had watched the (Spanish) King's speech on Christmas Eve and hers was a hundred times better. I read recently she writes her own speech and that gives her even more credit. It's unbelievable how well she speaks for a nonagenarian. What I love about the broadcast compared to the Spanish version is the setting and the pomp that goes with it, not to mention the national anthem at the beginning and the music provided by St. George's Chapel. If in the Spanish King's speech we were all looking for hints about the Catalan issue, in the Queen's speech we were all looking for a mention or hint of Brexit and it was there but very subtle.  The Spanish King's speech was boring and predictable in comparison. Her majesty's bumpy year of course refers to the issue of her son Prince Andrew and the woes of her grandson Harry and American wife Meghan Markle.  But it also refers to Brexit.  Her speech starts with a mention of the 50th anniversary of the moon landings and the famous words "one small step for man and a giant step for mankind", adding and "womankind". In a comparison to WW2 she asks for small steps to overcome differences. She cites the example of Jesus and how "small steps taken in faith and in hope" can overcome "long-held differences". She ends her speech praising young people for their action against climate change and protecting the environment and adds, after her reference to the 50th anniversary of the moon landings, "it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change", I have to say her speech was very well crafted and I also hope she will be here in the coming years to continue to inspire us. I am not an out and out monarchist but the Queen has been there throughout my lifetime and I cannot imagine it without her, as I can't imagine my life without my father. I am sure he too liked this year's Christmas Broadcast.<br></br>
<br></br>
There was not much news on Christmas Day and in any case we had missed the main section. When Elliot got a bit fretful, we all went upstairs to start the going to bed process. Before going to my room I was asked into Oli's to join the girls singing carols to our little baby. He was delighted.<br></br>
<br></br>
Our day ended watching the first 2 episodes of the series about Chernobyl which needs no explanation to any of you. I well remember it happening in 1986 when the Ukraine was still part of the USSR. The series has caused a stir in what is Russia today.<br></br>
<br></br>
I woke up on Boxing Day to a clear and sunny day. It was another day spent mostly with the family. In the morning Oli, Elliot and I went out on errands, principally to the post office to send off my father's book to an ex pupil but also to pick up a mysterious parcel. It turned out to be a Christmas present to my family and I from my new found Airbnb guest from last January, Joanne W. Joanne who is a teacher of Spanish in Lancashire, has become a friend and was instrumental in researching my father's book. She must like me a lot as she sends many gifts, even to my father who she actually never got to meet. She even sent gifts and cards on the birth of Elliot.<br></br>
<br></br>
Oli and I opened the parcel when we went to have a coffee at Alverán and while little Elliot slept in his pram. It was so sunny we sat outside. It took a while to open the well wrapped parcel and we were astonished to see that inside there were various parcels which were beautifully gift wrapped, each with their own pretty label, as well as some fabulous cards. One of the cards was to me; a bereavement card for the loss of Fátima. That was very thoughtful. We saw there were cards for us all, luxury cards that can only be found in England, as well as presents for Elliot, my father and myself. Oli and I were overwhelmed at the generosity, thoughtfulness and creativity right down to the final detail. Joanne had even wrapped Elliot's presents in baby themed wrapping. So what was inside the unexpected parcel? Well, gosh, things you can't get here as Joanne well knows. For me there was a most beautiful metal poppy brooch to wear on Remembrance Day, something I shall keep for always. For Elliot there was a lovely Christmas decoration for the tree personalised with his name. Imagine. This is it and I know Oli will hang it on her tree every year from now on.<br></br>

Knowing Elliot's first Christmas with us was so special, Joanne had even found this little outfit for him in which he looks so cute. Don't you think?<br></br>
<table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

Later I gave my father his present. He was surprised and asked "who is it from?". I had to tell him that my newly found friend from Lancashire had once again surprised us all and to explain who she was. He was delighted to see a pack of mint Aero chocolate, his favourite as my friend knows. I have no words to thank Joanne for her kindness and thoughtfulness. All I can say is: "Thank you my friend for remembering us at Christmas and for all the effort taken to come up with the most delightful presents possible".<br></br>
<br></br>
Lunch was a sort of repeat of Christmas Day. I had plenty of trimmings left, so just roast a few chicken legs and made more stuffing to serve up the perfect roast again. Everyone appreciated it. We all needed to sleep off the excess later, except that I couldn't sleep. Instead I watched a fascinating film on Netflix, based on a true story, called "Brain on Fire". I was fascinated by the story and later downloaded the book by Susannah Cahalan, a reporter for The New York Post. She wrote her own story after suffering a most terrible brain disorder. It was just up my street and I was thankful for a happy ending.<br></br>
<br></br>
It was just Oli, Eladio and I on the walk that afternoon. Suzy was working and would later meet her friend Elenita. Oli and Miguel would join them for dinner that night.  Before they left, Oli and Miguel bathed their baby. Later Oli sent us a photo of little Elliot in the bath. He always closes his fists as if to protect himself. I think he is a little scared don't you?  But just look at how big he is now. He is only 3 months old but is the size of a 6 month old baby!  Eladio loved the photo and remarked he is resembling our family now and looks like Suzy when she was a baby. I can't see the resemblance.<br></br>

Thus that night we were sort of "home alone" and it was actually a bit of a respite, at least as far as providing food on the table was concerned. That night we watched two more episodes of Chernobyl. What a frightening story it is.<br></br>
<br></br>
I woke up quite late for me on Friday, at about 7 a.m. Christmas was over but I still had to plan for New Year's Eve, our trip to Montrondo and for "Kings' Day" so there was plenty to get down to. I had to do my purchases online as Eladio took my Mini while his car, the old Volvo, is at the garage. Thus I had to stay at home all morning. Oli and her little family left to go to his parents for lunch and we wouldn't see them again until today. Suzy was busy with her lessons so I made lunch.<br></br>
<br></br>
Our afternoon and evening were quiet. Suzy left to go away for the weekend and we stayed at home, once again "home alone" but not for long. At just after 7 pm, our last Airbnb guests of the year arrived; Silvia, her husband and one of their mothers. The young couple live in Lisbon they told me and spoke great English which is unusual for Chinese guests in my experience. The mother did not and all I could say was the only word I know in Mandarin: "nihau". After they settled in we had dinner on our own and later watched the last episode of Chernobyl. It's a great series but focuses on the story of the scientist, Valery Legasov, played by Jared Harris (King George VI in The Crown) and how he gets to the bottom of what really happened at Chernobyl and how the communist authorities wanted him to hide the truth. That part is very interesting of course but I would have liked to see more of the effects on the population, not much of which is shown, except for the terrible deaths of those involved in trying to stop the explosion or stopping the fire after the nuclear explosion happened. We later started watching The Handmaid's Tale which I was keen to see after having read the book. Eladio thought it was weird and it is so we changed to The Spanish Princess about Catherine of Aragon. She is a very important figure in Spanish and English history but the production didn't really convince us.<br></br>
<br></br>
With so much TV, we switched off our lights at well past midnight. I was awake at 6 am yesterday morning and got up at 6.30 to a quiet and dark house.  Saturday was quiet without the girls. I took the opportunity to go to the hairdresser to see to my roots. I also dyed my blonde eye lashes; not that it makes much difference. I was there early and was lucky to be second in the queue. Thus I was out and free just over 1.5h later. I do hate going to the hairdresser but I'm glad I did now as I hated the dreaded white roots. I dashed into Carrefour Market on the way home to get some food for lunch. Yes, we were running out of provisions hahahaha. We had a healthy lunch of fresh fish and vegetables followed by more chocolate which is too irresistible at Christmas I am afraid. I can feel the pounds piling on and can only comfort myself by promising to go on a diet in January which I know I will. It will be my main New Year resolution.<br></br>
<br></br>
The rest of the day panned out quite routinely which of course included a long walk in the afternoon. We didn't see our Chinese guests at all although we heard them arrive last night. This morning they will be leaving and we shall now have the house to ourselves until 8th January as I have blocked the calendar until then.<br></br>
<br></br>
Today I was up again at 6 a.m, far too early but here I am. I have a pleasant day to look forward. Oli and her family will be here for lunch and in the afternoon my dear friend Julio will be here to see us. He is coming to visit Elliot really and bring him a present. Both Julio and I miss Fátima dreadfully this Christmas as well as our annual dinners with her. We didn't have the heart to carry on the tradition but his coming for afternoon tea this afternoon might spark off a new one. I hope so.<br></br>
<br></br>
For the first time ever we shall be holding a New Year's Eve party. There is quite a lot of planning going into it and yesterday the silly glasses I ordered online arrived for everyone to wear. I just had to try them out on Eladio hahahaha.<br></br>

I have never really liked NYE, but this year will make a big effort, not only because we shall be celebrating the beginning of a new decade but because all my family and all of Miguel's will be here too as well as my Uni friend, Sandra. My life would not be the same without my beloved family and all I wish for 2020 and the coming years is good health and happiness for my family. May I take this opportunity  to wish all of you who read and follow my blog, health and happiness too, the pillars of a good life.<br></br>
