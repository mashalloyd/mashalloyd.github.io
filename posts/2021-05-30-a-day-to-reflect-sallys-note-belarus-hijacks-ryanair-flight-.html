Like most people this week has had its ups and downs. .  </p><p style="text-align: justify;">So has the virus. Numbers were down in my home country, the UK, but now they are on the rise because of the very infectious Indian variant. That may skew plans for the final lifting of restrictions planned for 21st June. Worldwide, the numbers are still increasing, especially in India and countries in Latin America. Last Sunday the numbers for infections and deaths were 167.058.099 and 3.338.966.  Today they have gone up to 170.638.059 and 3.548.839 respectively.  This week we have seen news on the increased suspicion that the source of the virus really came from the Lab in Wuhan after it was discovered that 3 employees there fell ill in late 2019. Vaccine programmes are ramping up but only really in so-called rich countries. In the UK more than 50% of the population has received a jab but worldwide only 5% of the population has been inoculated. That's not good. In Spain numbers are down and the number of infected per 100.000 people - the way the virus is measured here - is down to 126. In Madrid it is just under 190 or so. So, we are still a sort of hot spot. The "islands" are faring better and we are now seeing the arrival of international tourists, mostly from Germany but also the UK. Spain welcomes British citizens. But what happens if some of them bring the Indian variant here? </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Definitely last Sunday was a down day. It was a day to reflect and to remember my father's family who perished in an air crash 50 years ago. You may have read the tribute to them which I published last Sunday. When my father read it he remarked "so many tragedies". He is right. He has lost everyone except me and yet sill there is a twinkle in his eye and he wants to go on. I was uplifted a little bit when I listened to the online service at St. Giles Church in Ickenham where they are buried. The Rector, Felicity, had organised it and you can see it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzPMvC5B0-8">here</a>. It was lovely but I was bit disappointed when she said that my father was the brother of Derek and not Gloria, my Aunt. It's the thought that counts though of course. One of the Ickenham neighbours, Jenny,  who I am often in touch with, sent me photos of the grave during the day  where more flowers were appearing.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjImMbtyUF3K0bSvdpR6pdqe4lXVNVi6GiOPqJsEgLQWQk9a5GHXbjUNRYijijfX_5ZpkHZmsVPl_LnSB5no9z7RNf6jYwDKKtzOGrmAwMTqMuW2DYvHUtvxBbKXR4tcVpgrcNH_w/s2048/More+flowers1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjImMbtyUF3K0bSvdpR6pdqe4lXVNVi6GiOPqJsEgLQWQk9a5GHXbjUNRYijijfX_5ZpkHZmsVPl_LnSB5no9z7RNf6jYwDKKtzOGrmAwMTqMuW2DYvHUtvxBbKXR4tcVpgrcNH_w/w300-h400/More+flowers1.jpg" width="300"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Flowers and notes on my family's grave</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">They were from us, from the children's school, from  a close friend of Michael and  from these lovely nieghbours.

I didn't have much energy for anything else. I just went through the motions. I went on my walk with Eladio and the dogs, I made our lunch and then had a long siesta. Meanwhile, Oli and family were holding a lunch party at our house for the girls' friends and sisters, Chati and Elena. It was good to see them again. Suzy, by the way, seemed better last Sunday after being discharged from the local hospital in Muelle de los Bueyes in remote Nicaragua. I think though she should have rested rather than be up on her feet. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the afternoon I had a long Skype call with my friends Kathy and Phil in Yorkshire. I can always pour out my heart to them and they will always listen. It's amazing how close we are. I can't wait to see them again.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The house was empty by the evening. Our last guest, Mo, had left and so had Oli and family. Then it was dinner time and I rustled something up and by 9.30 we were in bed. I was shocked at the news of a Ryan Air flight from Athens to Vilna that night. It was carrying the Belarus journalist, blogger and activist, Protasevich and was  deceitfully rerouted to land in Minsk where he was arrested. 26 year old Roman Protasevich works or worked for a Polish based online news service which broadcast images of protests against the  hard line leader Alexander Lukashenko. He was wanted for  extremism charges such as organising mass riots against last years protests. Now in Minsk he could face 15 years in prison or even a death sentence. Belarus is the only country in Europe to maintain this barbaric method of punishment. As the plane landed, Protasevich had his head in his hands and was shaking as he realised the flight had landed in Minsk. As he was led away he was heard saying "I will get the death penalty here". Europe was up in arms at this act of hijacking a European plane and the deceit the Belarus government had used to force it to land in Minsk. This cannot be happening in Europe. It is unprecedented and could have terrible repercussions for freedom of press. Worst of all I fear for this young man's life and that of his Russian girlfriend who was also arrested in a country headed by  Lukashenko,  Europe's last dictator. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi42GGtBlNAbhGCFb6XV__5j0CGlXVpClgKUUDxFOOnA9VcgoJPoWI9-dtLoEhR46qm6vj0ouP3K2BgnIHcEe2oqRHuD_Eaql8tvjeBMcTHsua1FLuovFjus4kNMZqXLWHkVhkl7A/s1200/3349.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi42GGtBlNAbhGCFb6XV__5j0CGlXVpClgKUUDxFOOnA9VcgoJPoWI9-dtLoEhR46qm6vj0ouP3K2BgnIHcEe2oqRHuD_Eaql8tvjeBMcTHsua1FLuovFjus4kNMZqXLWHkVhkl7A/w400-h400/3349.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Roman Protasevich the journalist wanted by Belarus and the objective of the hijacking of the Ryan Air flight last Sunday night.</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I think I was so exhausted emotionally that I slept relatively well on Sunday night.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Monday dawned, Kathy's birthday by the way. A very happy birthday to you my friend. They would be celebrating with a two night trip to Durham, a beautiful cathedral city in the North East of England. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Monday was a quiet day after the calm. I was still sorting out Suzy's new return ticket from Nicaragua - no easy task. There are no direct flights from Managua. We went on our walk and I came back to make lunch; veg soup and meat balls for 6 as Oli and Miguel were coming for lunch. Monday was a very important day for them. At 13h that day they signed the deeds of their new and first flat which is very near us. They will be moving in tomorrow. They arrived just in time for a late lunch, radiant with the flat keys in their hands. They left soon afterwards as they have so much to do before moving in. We continued our day as usual. The highlight was my weekly Skype call with Amanda. We also pour out each other's hearts together. What would I do without my close friends?  If only they lived closer to me. I do miss them so.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Tuesday was a busy day. Eladio and I drove to the shopping centre where we had bought the 4G router and Yoigo sim card to use for Wifi at our house in El Cuetu. As you may have read in a recent blog, it didn't work so we had to cancel the contract for the Yoigo line and return the router to Fnac. We learned Fnac doesn't refund products bought unless they are faulty (good lesson never to shop there again). We also learned it is damned hard to cancel a Yoigo contract. It took at least 30 minutes on the phone while they offered me all sorts of services I was not interested in. From there we went to a garage (boring) to fix something minor in Eladio's old Volvo. It was actually my Nokia company car (an S60) which I got in about 2004. Wondering how much longer it will last I checked the mileage and it has clocked up about 170.000 kms, which is not very much for 17 years. While there we had a coffee in the street; always a joy. We were home by about 12.30 and I had the lunch to see to. I was making bean stew (fabada) with ingredients I had bought in Asturias. Oli would be joining us for lunch but she preferred my leftover curry. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">She didn't bring Elliot but we did get a good morning photo from her of our little grandson. He is seated in the front of the car where he loves to be as he is car and motorbike crazy but of course he has to ride in the back. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLOM94WohtV-mLJlgXcxMzPoPQdvBV2cmuObQvUwIcrNv8CsdMT6haPNPIOR4ZNGe2yHmeePShnlrdAfhbe6sFc7cuXnj5umQCFeMI7dK6ZdKGbXMVx46aMooika0N9LOcXS57Og/s1448/Tuesday+Elliot+good+morning.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLOM94WohtV-mLJlgXcxMzPoPQdvBV2cmuObQvUwIcrNv8CsdMT6haPNPIOR4ZNGe2yHmeePShnlrdAfhbe6sFc7cuXnj5umQCFeMI7dK6ZdKGbXMVx46aMooika0N9LOcXS57Og/w293-h400/Tuesday+Elliot+good+morning.jpg" width="293"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A good morning photo of Elliot from Oli on Tuesday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">With time on my hands I decided first to bathe Pippa (much in need) and then to prune both the roses and the geraniums which had bloomed so much in our absence  thanks to all the rain and sunshine. This week has been very warm and pleasant compared to the wet weather we had in Asturias. Pippa, as usual, joined me.

She is actually in the middle of nowhere in Nicaragua so will have to make her way to Costa Rica to return as there are no decent flights from Managua. Then I had to confirm with Suzy what her wishes were but had to wait a few hours for her to wake up. I only got a reply from her in the middle of my siesta. She wanted a flight on 4th June. I immediately rang eDreams again and it took nearly 50 minutes on the phone to secure her new ticket which included a penalty of 150 euros (again) for the flight change. I needed an invoice to present to the health insurance company. Then I noticed the ticket said 0 pieces of luggage when it should have said 1 piece. Again, I had to wait for a rectification. Thus my business with them didn't end that day. It would continue. It ended well though, with them apologising and refunding the cost of one of the penalties for changing flights and for the luggage. Edreams turned out to be a nightmare but by Friday the nightmare ended. My worries though will only end when Suzy takes that flight and arrives here safely.</div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">That nearly made me late for my emergency dental appointment at 18.10 in Majadahonda with my trusted dentist, Dr. Garralda. The two partial crowns his colleague had put in in March had both fallen out. Thankfully I had kept them and he was able to stick them back on. However, he says if they fall out again and I'm sure they will, I will need full crowns. I have a feeling I should have had full crowns in the first place and no doubt if my dentist had not been in hospital at the time, he would have recommended them too. Now, I have to be extremely careful not to eat anything too chewy or hard.

This documentary, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0174852/">The Last Days</a>,  by Steven Spielberg and others, was made in 1998 and includes interviews with 5 Hungarian Jews who survived the Holocaust. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhPDGelKWn4zVfwauzCA8grZ0vPX7RUMV8F0aG7gq58J87UeXM6mdgSnxhGuztL7vsqkZWfK754bvV4dmcUJHbHNgX3uTH4viqoaVC_NOitJfmh8xMvmGrLYm9omAP5Sydv5x2-yw/s475/thelastdaysdvd.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhPDGelKWn4zVfwauzCA8grZ0vPX7RUMV8F0aG7gq58J87UeXM6mdgSnxhGuztL7vsqkZWfK754bvV4dmcUJHbHNgX3uTH4viqoaVC_NOitJfmh8xMvmGrLYm9omAP5Sydv5x2-yw/w400-h400/thelastdaysdvd.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>An absolute must to watch</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">They tell their story and some of the scenes are the most shocking I have ever seen. They are also filmed returning to the camps or to their home towns for the first time since liberation. They do so accompanied by their families. These people are now no longer alive and I am grateful to the film makers for documenting their testimony. Very few people who survived the Holocaust are alive today and soon past interviews will be all we have. As I watched this harrowing but must see documentary, I thought of my friend Sandra's mother, Magda now aged 95 or so. She survived the Nazi invasion in Budapest together with her mother when friends hid them. I keep urging Sandra to tape her mother too before it is too late. If you are interested it's on Netflix.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">Wednesday was to be an agreeable day. I had a 10 am appointment with my new hairdresser, Caty, and walked there - takes about 20 mins - I was much in need of a cut and dying of the roots (so much white in my hair) and had to postpone my previous appointment when my father was ill a few weeks ago. I came out feeling younger. I wish I had taken a photo. I don't like going to the hairdresser. I consider it a necessary evil but I do love having coffee with friends. Thus I loved the next item on my agenda, coffee with Elena M, my neighbour, friend and ex telecoms Communications Director, like me. She always keeps up with me. I wish I could say the same. But I always enjoy a natter with her. I wish we had taken a photo then too but we were too engrossed in our conversation. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">She drove me home as it was late by then and I had another phone call to make to eDreams. I have clocked up several hours of conversations. I was on the phone until lunchtime, leftovers  and then the afternoon was mine for the taking. While I was watching more of Grey's Anatomy and Eladio was mowing the lawn, in the UK, something important was happening. It's no news now that Boris Johnson's former most important aide, the unlikeable  Dominic Cummings, was on stage that day to attack his former boss over the government's management of the Covid crisis. I hate the man but I am no fan of Boris Johson and actually agree with Cummings that he was not fit to be PM when Covid started. The only thing he has got right is the vaccination plan. Time will tell if Cumming's revenge makes any difference to Number 10. I sort of doubt it.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">That night we watched an interview with Spain's former Socialist PM, Felipe González who was in power for over 12 years shortly after democracy was restored in this country. He is by far the most charismatic PM Spain has had since I came to live here in 1981 and he is always fascinating to listen to. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuDNLZj_aEW0-q56yxXex7Ade46CAWKLisnun8-JWIhHC3RUguv6y3wSWN80DpIScvqI-0_Y4ptwY2BqqvTwzP9XZolyofQ-W6W0oQUezud4meIDPCauiaQelDBnKkSpMDVtZS2Q/s2048/Felipe+G+age.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuDNLZj_aEW0-q56yxXex7Ade46CAWKLisnun8-JWIhHC3RUguv6y3wSWN80DpIScvqI-0_Y4ptwY2BqqvTwzP9XZolyofQ-W6W0oQUezud4meIDPCauiaQelDBnKkSpMDVtZS2Q/w400-h400/Felipe+G+age.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Spain's most famous politician of modern times, Felipe González  - young and old (as he appeared this week in a TV interview).

The current big news in Spain is the pardoning of the the leaders of the illegal referendum in Catalonia who are in prison. The socialist PM, Pedro Sánchez wants to pardon them or is forced to pardon them if he is to continue to rely on the support of the Catalan secessionists for his fragile coalition government to rule. It was interesting to hear from Felipe González that under the current circumstances he wouldn't pardon them. The Supreme Court in Spain agrees with the latter saying it is an unacceptable solution given that the convicted do no show the slightest sign of repentance which is an essential part of any pardoning. No doubt Sánchez will go ahead despite the court's opinion but it may lead to his political downfall. He should take a leaf out of Gonzalez's book. Boris Johnson has his troubles but so does Spain's premiere, Pedro Sánchez. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Thursday came and brought more sunshine.

That morning saw us doing part of the weekly shopping at 3 of our 4 usual supermarkets. I do wish I could get everything we want at just one but that's not possible. I am not a fan of buying online either as I prefer to choose what I buy or maybe add things that aren't on my initial list.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I made lasagna for lunch, a popular dish in this house and soft for my father and me because of the newly stuck-on-again partial crowns. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">My quiet afternoon was interrupted with more calls to and from eDreams.  I had another incident to deal with which also spoiled my afternoon. My ex company, the mobile phone operator, Yoigo, now owned my Masmovil, the company that bought Yoigo and fired me along with all the management team, rang me with a whole range of offers I wasn't very interested in. However I took the bait for a phone for only 2 euros. Stupidly I went ahead and gave all my visa card details only to be charged 9 euros twice. It was then that I was told the supposedly free phone would cost 9 euros and then 2 euros per month for 24 months. I immediately said I didn't want the phone and would they please reimburse the money. I was flabbergasted when the commercial rep who had rung me, put the phone down. Then began my odyssey to cancel the order for the damned phone, a stupid Chinese one I have no use for, and that was where my kafkian journey began. I was disappointed in my previous employer and didn't recognise the Yoigo that I knew when I worked there. Unfortunately most of my former colleagues suffered the same treatment as me and no longer work there. It was a lesson not to take the bait when something is offered for free and a lesson never to give my visa card details on the phone. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I cheered up at dinner time where Eladio and I enjoyed a meal of carrot and coriander soup followed by spring rolls and black cherries. The black cherry season is just beginning - my favourite fruit of all. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Who had a good day was little Elliot. That afternoon he joined his parents at the RTVE studios in Prado del Rey where his father was working at the set where the programme "Saber Vivir" is filmed. Elliot was enthralled with the camera his father uses. He seems to love machines of all types, especially if there are lots of buttons hahaha. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBlVofs2j7AVjzobE9FZwvKxbEDKD7kR-H2MFwrUj1U3o_3tCnc9_YLFcmhY9Meo1Gkz_w9NhfhRP0QofY_MBJxKqWgH3H9EY7bxo6yJDE_2hNMl7kPGgZ2L1X1sUbRV7oBFJgWQ/s2016/IMG-20210527-WA0013.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBlVofs2j7AVjzobE9FZwvKxbEDKD7kR-H2MFwrUj1U3o_3tCnc9_YLFcmhY9Meo1Gkz_w9NhfhRP0QofY_MBJxKqWgH3H9EY7bxo6yJDE_2hNMl7kPGgZ2L1X1sUbRV7oBFJgWQ/w225-h400/IMG-20210527-WA0013.jpg" width="225"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Miguel showing Elliot his camera.

At 8 am I was watching Oli on TV who was the second presenter that day for the programme she works for, La Hora de la 1 on RTVE, the state broadcaster.

I was surprised to hear from my friend Jacqueline, that Mercadona has opened up a buying centre in Harrogate (wonderful city in Yorkshire) to procure fish from the North Sea for its range of supermarkets in Spain. I wonder if they are thinking of opening up stores there and if they do I wonder if they will enjoy the success they do here. Again the highlight was a cup of coffee together at Alverán, our favourite cafe and bakery. Oli joined us unexpectedly for lunch and was delighted I had prepared fish and chips. But she was off again to their new flat where Zena, our weekend carer and her cleaner, was arriving to clean it after the painters had done their job. Oli could have told us she had taken the broom and dustpan. Thankfully she returned them the next day. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I had a long video call with Suzy that afternoon.

She is here for 4 nights and without a car it is going to be challenging. She seemed happy enough though and loved her room, the house, the garden and the pool.
