How are coping with the Christmas aftermath? How were your New Year celebrations?</p><p>For us, you see, Christmas lasts one more week  than most countries.  Spaniards get to celebrate  three events;  Christmas, New Year and Kings' Day which was yesterday, Saturday 6th January.  Epiphany, or Kings' Day in Spain is when most children get their presents from Kings Melchor, Baltazar and Gaspar,  although these days they also get them from Father Christmas.  Also, Christmas is not over for most Orthodox believers. It is today, Sunday 7th January.  My mother used to have us celebrate it when I was a child so it still has some significance for me. <br></br></p><p><b>Last Sunday</b> was New Year's Eve. So let me tell you about our end of year celebrations. Olivia, my youngest daughter, was in charge of the food; i.e. she was making our dinner, giving me a break. She is an adventurous cook but needs quite a few skivvies around her. Thankfully, Tana did all the chopping, etc as well as cleaning up after her. I, meanwhile was preparing the food for the next day, 1st January when Eladio's brother and all his family - 13 of them, were coming for lunch. </p><p>Oli arrived alone which made things easier as when the kids are around it's a bit chaotic to say the least. By 9 pm we were sitting around the table to eat Oli's delicious food. This was the starter; a sort of pastry basket stuffed with mushrooms, foie and apples.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEitOHx_f8a0tGf78Wd-mxztyfCrBQvLfAZogxI1tUPH7hUuc7Yn6Cj5d_-REPQ-WwAfVMCJxEvKlcly5jCu08eIBCM16_aAgV_CgIF1O4pyz7ZGbKp4c_xDV6BbWWggF4-XyNRdurXfB9HmQHebnMhc23zkzHtmzWofrpCCpRAdO2p7c41t4PAAPQ/s4032/20231231_205207.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEitOHx_f8a0tGf78Wd-mxztyfCrBQvLfAZogxI1tUPH7hUuc7Yn6Cj5d_-REPQ-WwAfVMCJxEvKlcly5jCu08eIBCM16_aAgV_CgIF1O4pyz7ZGbKp4c_xDV6BbWWggF4-XyNRdurXfB9HmQHebnMhc23zkzHtmzWofrpCCpRAdO2p7c41t4PAAPQ/w400-h180/20231231_205207.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Oli's starter on New Year's Eve</i></td></tr></tbody></table>The second course was rice with more mushrooms and a delicious creamy pepper sauce with prawns on top, served like this:<table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhAdqiGcUQV_P30gT9LzNggyXnZCw9esoUgPhhQwUgu2BtqGH_xh9PfA_nukU12OeNa2BLjsqPl-C5OpL_S4BWHBxmSkqvpzdDe8i_nar0qBHGxIrUt6NQVd_VSIQBe7Z3DgtlvRu4CP7fYjGqeyXZW-RhFLDpm4MqeQ0YUPdzFVHAgd2hndPQBdw/s4032/20231231_210027.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhAdqiGcUQV_P30gT9LzNggyXnZCw9esoUgPhhQwUgu2BtqGH_xh9PfA_nukU12OeNa2BLjsqPl-C5OpL_S4BWHBxmSkqvpzdDe8i_nar0qBHGxIrUt6NQVd_VSIQBe7Z3DgtlvRu4CP7fYjGqeyXZW-RhFLDpm4MqeQ0YUPdzFVHAgd2hndPQBdw/w400-h180/20231231_210027.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Oli's second course on New Year's Eve</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Dessert was my very successful baklava. Everyone loved it and I am pleased that it turned out so well.<div><br></br></div><div>We then all had to wait until 12 for the count down. In Spain people eat 12 grapes for luck for each month of the year. Each grape is eaten chime by chime and it's quite difficult to do. I ended up with about 8 still in my mouth  - take into account I can still only eat on one side of it (boohoo).</div><div><br></br></div><div>These were the grapes I got for everyone.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjal9tYVcGONqspjeAtOj-FkYkVloPswkY54tC7yPAWiNTBkl2ollxCGJEm9OFQ5R6weaBrAr0kaKDi_tOpoBOcUrhQhJ52TsJ6nmKtiQbXx2J75orAgi7FQUB_5ztpOwA4N8gS0tw1npMPI5yNBzKJqzluppyCbheOwk1SZJhLf2mTw8JBcT7MGw/s2421/20231231_232723.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="284" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjal9tYVcGONqspjeAtOj-FkYkVloPswkY54tC7yPAWiNTBkl2ollxCGJEm9OFQ5R6weaBrAr0kaKDi_tOpoBOcUrhQhJ52TsJ6nmKtiQbXx2J75orAgi7FQUB_5ztpOwA4N8gS0tw1npMPI5yNBzKJqzluppyCbheOwk1SZJhLf2mTw8JBcT7MGw/w400-h284/20231231_232723.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>12 grapes are eaten on the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve in Spain</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>It was Elliot's first time and I think he managed about 5. After the grape eating, a tradition that goes back centuries - something to do with a harvest glut in the Alicante region - people hug and wish each other a Happy New Year. Then champagne is served. Elliot love the pop it made. We only had a token amount and I think I must have poured three quarters of the bottle down the drain afterwards! This year, for the first time since I left England back in 1981, I really missed the tradition of singing Auld Lang Syne. I kept thinking of it the week leading up to NYE and even cried for those no longer with us. I hesitantly suggested to Oli and Eladio that we sing it this year and sent them the lyrics but it never happened. Maybe I should have instilled the tradition when the girls were small. I wish I had now.</div><div><br></br></div><div>While most people in Spain would begin the party after 12 and many until 7 or so in the morning, Oli and family left and we went to bed. The difficult thing for me these days is to stay awake until midnight on New Year's Eve. If we had been alone, no doubt we would have been in bed by 9.30 pm, hahahaha and to hell with the grapes. </div><div><br></br></div><div>I was up at around 7 am on New Year's Day which was <b>Monday</b> and I thought was Sunday - what's happening to my mind? I had lots to do to get all the food ready for Eladio's family who were arriving around 2 pm. Thankfully I had Tana and Oli to help. We managed to get 8 children around one of the tables and 11 adults around the other. This is what the dining room looked like.</div><div><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFTftBP4mklqq3w83AozIJkQOC07sl8ZOM_Bd7xBrew4DKVOR21AB5WOPa2OmTFHLJJAJCXBGZfabXP6AhfnycKAhGmzUKiTETPjYp8AE8M9CdQNvD2Va2i3H47gb_zLxKCQNcYvoGPPVaHNf3tQXjZ6qE9kRzke6nGvIMHkVY2YTE_UvlViE1Sw/s4032/20240101_141601.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjFTftBP4mklqq3w83AozIJkQOC07sl8ZOM_Bd7xBrew4DKVOR21AB5WOPa2OmTFHLJJAJCXBGZfabXP6AhfnycKAhGmzUKiTETPjYp8AE8M9CdQNvD2Va2i3H47gb_zLxKCQNcYvoGPPVaHNf3tQXjZ6qE9kRzke6nGvIMHkVY2YTE_UvlViE1Sw/w400-h180/20240101_141601.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The tables laid for our New Year's Day family lunch</i></td></tr></tbody></table>I made a buffet lunch and this is what it looked like.

That's because they are not too keen on appearing online. A good time was had by all, especially the kids from ages 9 to 1. I wish they could see each other more often as they get on famously.<div><br></br></div><div>They all left far too early at around 6pm, just before it was getting dark. I think poor Tana was still clearing up then - round of applause for her - and all we had to do was to tidy up the lounges - mostly re order my Christmas "toys" which, of course, the kids loved. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We were dead that night but happy with the day as it is very rare for us all to get together unless we are in Montrondo in the summer. </div><div><br></br></div><div>I didn't sleep too badly and although I was awake at 5 and then 5.30, I slept until I woke up again at 7.15 on <b>Tuesday</b> morning. For most of you outside Spain, the 2nd marks the end of the Christmas holidays. In Spain, it's today, 7th January and kids go back to school tomorrow. <br></br><div><br></br><div>We went out to do our Kings' Day present shopping and chose Centro Oeste in Majadahonda with which we are more familiar. First I had a coffee though before we sauntered into the men's section of Zara. I wanted to get something for my friend Julio and ended up buying not only his present there but also Miguel's and Eladio's. My husband had to try his on, something he is quite averse to. Once the wife of former President Aznar famously said there is not one woman in Spain without at least one item of clothing from Zara in her wardrobe. I'm not sure it's the same for men, or for Julio who is perhaps more into branded clothing. Oh well, he can always change his present - he usually does hahaha.</div><div><br></br></div><div>We got the rest of the presents from Zara Home so contributed to making Amancio Ortega, the owner, just a little bit richer. He is one of the richest men in the world so I don't suppose he needs any more money but I have to say I do like his shops as do a lot of people. Otherwise, he wouldn't be rich would he? He went from rags to riches - never better said. Aged just 16 he started a sewing business in Galicia in 1953  making baby clothes, under wear and night gowns. He opened his first Zara shop in 1973 in La Coruña. 12 years later he opened his first shop outside Spain. Of course he has now gone online but still owns over 2200 shops in 96 countries. Yet not  once did he invest in advertising. He didn't need to. His stores are always in prime locations and the fashion style is always the latest but at affordable prices. At Zara Home we found lovely children's toys made with wood which cheered my heart as today they all seem to be digital and made with plastic. We got a lovely alphabet board in English and a black board and I had trouble deciding which one to give to Juliet and which one to give to Elliot. I hope they like them. I've had enough of Spider Man and "Super Things" toys, so I hoped they would like these as much as I do. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjyO1cVLHXYrzB9Ys7p1NCmm-W044GxnlWuIahIGjB5Q90_oOsGyCKJOCHeYgjCrie2mmU7LggB2IJbmPzo1QX96f7CMUWCneceG5Tya9dnbeNV3Z_vwgjcxKW4xCHvrzAI0w8xnVQFALRdSBjCbLsjcfZC6dBAYpUMWEIkJzBT1LawEguxe5MToQ/s1190/alphabet.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjyO1cVLHXYrzB9Ys7p1NCmm-W044GxnlWuIahIGjB5Q90_oOsGyCKJOCHeYgjCrie2mmU7LggB2IJbmPzo1QX96f7CMUWCneceG5Tya9dnbeNV3Z_vwgjcxKW4xCHvrzAI0w8xnVQFALRdSBjCbLsjcfZC6dBAYpUMWEIkJzBT1LawEguxe5MToQ/w323-h400/alphabet.webp" width="323"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJqfQpuy7tCGMqlJlWggEMjULbRiklhrziNFidjP2Oi5rYPxTNbGtYtyM7h2BW1U1vWaZSr7GuQZuFY0eBuTBgMyZtti_r6F03mh7UQNQhT-tdX9RgkfO8EHJA-yuI0E0C5rJpOM9hXP9_ayIHNgOf1wN725N-DcvKuYgPuOiCxkG7Uw2uZ7DJ_g/s1190/black%20board.webp" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJqfQpuy7tCGMqlJlWggEMjULbRiklhrziNFidjP2Oi5rYPxTNbGtYtyM7h2BW1U1vWaZSr7GuQZuFY0eBuTBgMyZtti_r6F03mh7UQNQhT-tdX9RgkfO8EHJA-yuI0E0C5rJpOM9hXP9_ayIHNgOf1wN725N-DcvKuYgPuOiCxkG7Uw2uZ7DJ_g/w323-h400/black%20board.webp" width="323"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Zara Home wooden toys for Juliet and Elliot's Kings' Day presents.</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>We were home to lunch on the table - leftovers from New Year's Day. The highlight of the afternoon was my first Skype call with Amanda this year. We had lots to tell each other and both commented that Christmas this year had lost a bit of its zest. I've always loved Christmas but this year somehow the joy was missing and that's because Suzy wasn't with us. </div><div><br></br></div><div>If Tuesday was a lovely sunny day, we woke up to rain on <b>Wednesday </b>and thus no walk. Instead we went out for a coffee and then to do some more food shopping (honestly!). Our conversation at Alverán cafe was important as we spoke about what we are going to do when we are really old. Our plan is to stay in this sprawling huge house and renting out rooms until we are no longer able to do so. So what then?  I have been looking into "senior living" alternatives and if it is possible that is something we would like to explore. The type we would like is where you actually buy and own an apartment for two in an assisted living environment but it has to be comfortable and with lots of outdoor space. They are only beginning to catch on in Spain.  Meanwhile, we shall get the most of out of independent living while we can and travel as much as possible. We are already talking about our next road trip where we would like to go as far as Azerbaijan and across the Caspian Sea to the "stan countires" (those we can visit). Really I would love to visit Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan but they are rather "no no" places; a bit too dangerous. Of course that means taking the same route we did to Georgia, through the Balkans and Turkey. It also means we will get to see more than we did last time. If you remember we had to curtail our return journey from Yerevan (Armenia) when Olivia announced she was getting married. The idea this time is not to have a return date. We loved our trip last year and want to go on the road again.

We spent a pleasant, if a little challenging, time with them until they left. We were going out that night so had to rush a bit. We actually had a dinner date. It was with my dear friend and ex Nokia colleague, Julio, who was inviting us out for a New Year meal. He had chosen a swish place called "Carbón" (coal) on Juan Bravo Street, a stone's throw away from where we used to live on a busy street called Francisco Silvela. It took under 30 minutes to get there as there was little traffic - unusual I thought. Thus we were early and took a walk along the centre of the boulevard on Juan Bravo. We went past the famous Ruber clinic where I used to go to have my ultrasound scans when I was pregnant with the girls. I remember arriving  with my bladder bursting.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Julio was already inside when we went in. We had brought presents for each other which we always exchange at New Year. He got me one of my  favourite perfumes (Flowerbomb by  Viktor and Rolf) and a book for Eladio. I got him a jumper and shirt from Zara and Eladio got him a white bath robe from Zara Home. We had such a lovely meal I forgot to take any pictures (boohoo). I really wish I had. I really wish too that I hadn't left my lovely off white snood behind. Oh dear. We told him about our ideas for "senior living" which Julio thought was fantastic, telling me I am always ahead of times. I'm not sure that's true but I try to be. We also told him about our road trip plan and he, like others, suggested it might be dangerous. My answer to this was "Who dares wins", the SAS motto I have taken on as my own. One can be in danger anywhere but not once did I feel in danger on our road trip last year. </div><div><br></br></div><div>As the evening came to an end, we agreed to meet again for my birthday in February and to invite him to our now not so new house in Asturias; both lovely things to look forward to. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We were home by 11 which is quite reasonable and I got a so so night of sleep. I could feel a cold coming on with a slight sore throat and a headache. Oh no, is this flu again I asked myself? In Spain right now there is an epidemic and I have seen many people wearing masks. Maybe I should too except that I absolutely hate them.</div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Thursday</b> came. It was a dark, foggy, wet and cold day but even so we went on our walk. Most of the day was quiet until the evening when we took Pippa to the vet. She needs her teeth properly cleaned to remove any plaque or tartar. Even though I brush her teeth regularly we have noticed they have gone brown probably from plaque which I read can be dangerous if it gets into her bloodstream and we don't want that. Cleaning dogs' teeth is a major operation. First there is a pre-op with a blood test and electrocardiogram which is what we went to do on Thursday. If all is well, then next week she will have her teeth professionally cleaned while intubated and under general  anaesthetic. Poor lamb but it has to be done.</div><div><br></br></div><div>That night we watched "Society of Snow", the much acclaimed  Spanish remake of "Alive" (Viven in Spanish) made in 1995. I'm sure you all know the story. A plane with a Uruguayan Rugby team and their family crashed in the middle of the Andes on route from Montevideo to Santiago de Chile in 1972. Of the 40 passengers and 5 crew, 33 survived but after more than 70 days in sub freezing temperatures only 14 made it. It was called the Miracle of the Andes. The story always fascinated me so I was keen to watch the remake. Overall, though, I think I prefer the original film. The remake is rather slow and it's not easy to know who is who. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Just before I fell asleep I received a message from Airbnb to tell me that once again I am a super host. I have been since 2017 when I began.

What made me happy was to see the the number of nights my guests stayed here, in Asturias or in Santa Pola, although the large majority stay here. The number of nights was 550!!! Isn't that amazing? When I embarked on this new journey 7 years ago after losing my high flying job as head of PR for a mobile phone company, I had no idea that I would achieve this success. It began as a way to help upkeep our huge sprawling house and has turned into something much bigger. Long may I continue to be a super host and long may guests choose to stay at our houses.
