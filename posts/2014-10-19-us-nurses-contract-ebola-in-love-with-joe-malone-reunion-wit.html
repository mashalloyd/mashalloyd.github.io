<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Hi everyone this sunny Sunday in October.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The rain has gone and it seems we are in the midst of another Indian
summer.  Yesterday the temperature in
Madrid rose to 27ºc and today it will be even warmer.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The news this week continued to be dominated by Ebola.  In Spain the other top two stories were about
the mess the head of the Catalán Government, Artur Mas, is in after having to
suspend his promised referendum for independence on 9<sup>th</sup> November
after it was declared illegal by the Spanish legal authorities.  Despite this he wants to go ahead with some
sort of consultation which seems to be leading him nowhere as it too will be
illegal.  Remember I told you that in the
Spanish Constitution referendums can only be held on a national and not
regional basis. The other story is yet another story of corruption.  The board of administration of my bank,
Bankia (Caja Madrid), have been caught out using “opaque” credit cards where
they all spent hundreds of thousands of euros on hotels, trips, luxury
restaurants and even on call girls, not to mention they took out money from
cash points whenever they wanted.  These
directors come from all sectors and political leanings and they are all
household names. They now have to return the money which they argue was just
part of their salary, although it was never declared.  The public cannot take much more of this sort
of pilfering when many of us mortals live on modest salaries and more than 25%
of the population is unemployed.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Ebola, as I say, continues to dominate the news.  Whilst more than 4000 people have died of the
virus in West Africa and more than 9000 people have the virus which kills 70%
of those infected, the Western World is only reacting now with initial aid
efforts once the deadly virus has reached its shores with a handful of
cases.  The only way to stop the virus
spreading is killing it at its source and until that happens, Ebola will spread
in any direction.  I mean imagine if it
spreads to countries like India or China with weaker health systems than in
Europe or the US.  In the latter the
health systems and governments can contain it as we are seeing but that would
not be the case in the undeveloped world. Spain was the first country to be
affected when the nurse, Teresa Romero, who had treated the repatriated Spanish
missionaries, was diagnosed with Ebola two weeks ago.  It became a huge crisis in this country and
people criticized the health system here and even the nurse herself.  Thankfully she is on the mend and all the
people she has been in contact with have all proved negative so far. It was
only when last Sunday when the American nurse, Nina Pham, was also diagnosed
with Ebola after having treated the Liberian man Thomas Duncan who later died,  that we all began to realize that maybe the
fault lay with the WHO protocol itself and not with our excellent health
systems.   It was said that the Spanish
nurse may have touched her face with a glove but that is not clear.  In the US it is still not known how Nina Pham
got infected.  But it tells us that the
virus is very dangerous to treat. Later in the week another nurse, Amber
Vinson, who had also treated Thomas Duncan, came down with symptoms of Ebola
and proved positive. The dreadful thing is that in between time she had
travelled on a plane with 130 people who will now all be in quarantine.  The WHO protocols will now surely ban health
staff who have cared for Ebola patients from travelling, amongst other things
such as visiting the hairdresser which was the case of Teresa Romero.   One big difference between the Spanish and
American case is about the nurses’ dogs. Whilst Teresa Romero’s dog Excalibur
was put down without her permission (she doesn’t even know yet), Nina Pham’s
dog is being taken care of.  That tells
you the difference in the countries’ attitudes to pets.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Sorry if I have written so much about this case but I feel very strongly
about it. So back to my week now.  Monday
was quiet.  I fasted of course.  That day I went to Yoigo for a meeting and as
usual went on my two hour long walks.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">My week was very busy in general and Tuesday morning saw me in Madrid attending
an event put on by the telecoms sector association, Ametic.  It was a post Santander telecoms congress
event for journalists and representatives from the sector.  It was held at the Club Financiero de Genóva,
on the top floor and bang in the centre of Madrid.  The rain had stopped and the sun had come out
and the views of the city were spectacular. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

so many fragrances with some very alluring names that it was difficult to
choose one.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I was about to buy the roses
one when I asked which was the most popular.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">

to get it.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I was told you can mix and
match the fragrances but I don’t think I will.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">But I did buy the matching soaps which I love.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I must tell you that I am now in love with
Joe Malone and from now on it is my favourite brand of perfume.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Have you ever tried it?</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">If you haven’t you must.</span></div>

catching up on our lives.  I was most
impressed to hear from Carmen that she and her partner have a foster child, a
15 year old girl from a broken family who has lived with them since she was
7.  That is something. I was also happy
to hear how well Carmen’s music and dance academy is doing.  Dearest Anne had brought me some dark Finnish
bread she knows we love, as well as some super Finish chocolates – the Fazer
brand which I also love.  We said our
goodbyes but not for long as I was meeting Anne again the next day.  As to Carmen we also agreed to meet soon as her
parents are now living in our neighbourhood.

dinner hosted by ADSL Zone at the 5 star Hesperia Hotel.   There are no other awards in the sector and
everyone who is anyone is always there. It’s a very popular event too as it is
the only one of its kind which gets us all together, the competition, ex
colleagues, colleagues, journalists, etc.  Even the
Spanish national police were there to receive a prize for the best twitter page
in the world apparently.  There are
prizes for the best mobile operator, the best fixed operator, the best
smartphone and many others. The special prizes are for the best CEO, best
journalist (Rebeca Arroyo from Europa Press well done!) and best communications director. 
The communications award is voted by the journalists in the sector.  I was sitting quietly at my dinner table with
my fellow communications directors from Telefonica, Orange, Vodafone,
Microsoft, LG, etc and couldn’t believe what I was hearing when my name was
called out to go up to receive the award of best communications director for
2014.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The journalists had voted for little me!</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I was bowled over and quickly had to improvise a speech in front of 150
people from the sector. I think I said something along the lines of: “</span><i style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Well I must have done something good” if I
have been awarded this prize when I am not even a journalist.  I never set out to be one but if I knew then
what I know now I would have wanted to be a journalist but not a communications
director, rather a war correspondent. 
Instead of that I waged a few wars in various telecoms companies. I
never chose what I wanted to do.  Life
always led me.  In the early 80’s life
led me to Spain because of love.  In the
early 90’s life led me to Motorola when mobile phones were just beginning; I
didn’t even know what they were.  It was
at Motorola where I first got an opportunity to start my career in
communications and events and it was thanks to my boss, Luis.  Without his help perhaps I wouldn’t be
standing here with this prize.  In 2000
life led me to Nokia in the years when it was like Google or Apple today
although I wasn’t really aware of how important it was.  At Nokia I grew professionally and also flew
all over the world.  Another person
there, Félix, gave me the opportunity to grow and to learn even more about my
profession.  Thanks Félix. And then 8
years ago life led me to Yoigo, a small mobile phone operator which was just
beginning. No one thought it would be successful but how wrong you all were. And
here once again a person gave me a great opportunity to start up the press
department and to contribute to building a completely new brand and compete
with the likes of Telefonica, etc.  That
person was Johan and we had such fun on our journey.  He has gone now and I miss him still, but
another person at Yoigo gave me an opportunity too, my current boss, the CEO
Eduardo. Thanks Eduardo first for for keeping me on and secondly for believing in me.   And life
led me to this sector and to this room tonight full of colleagues, the
competition and telecoms journalists. 
You all gave me an opportunity too and I thank you from the bottom of
my heart for this award which tells me I must have done something good”.</i></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">On Friday I felt as if I was walking on a cloud all day; having received
so many messages of congratulations on twitter, linked, facebook, whatsapp and
in person.  That morning though I was
extremely busy as it was results day. 
TeliaSonera announced the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter results including Yoigo’s.  The great thing was that our results were
perhaps the best ever.  We doubled in
profitability although sales were down, but they were down as we no longer “sell”
so many terminals, they are nearly all financed now.  The important figures were the ebitda, ebit
and service revenues (from the calls and data usage).  It was good to hear the CEO of TeliaSonera
saying to Bloomberg “we have a beautiful asset in Spain”.  After attending two conference calls and
sending out the media alert, I was off to the office for what we all Yoigo
Mornings (something I invented in Nokia Spain and imported to Yoigo); i.e. a
staff meeting to explain the results, introduce the new employees and have a
stand up lunch all together.  Yoigo
mornings are extremely popular, not to mention a great vehicle for internal
communication.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Leaving the office I hit the Friday afternoon traffic and it took me two
hours to get home.  Most of the way I
kept thinking how blessed I am for being able to work from home and not to have
to face the traffic every day as most people do. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">On Friday Olivia finally got a day off work to be able to go away for a
long weekend and disconnect from all the stress and tiredness her job
provokes.  She and Miguel had decided to
go to Sepúlveda in Segovia to visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoces_del_R%C3%ADo_Durat%C3%B3n_Natural_Park">Hoces del Rio Duratón Natural Park</a>.  They packed their bicycles as it was their
intention to cycle in the park.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

for her registration number on the HCP (health and care professions council) as
a dietitian. Once she has that and hopefully it will come through shortly, she
will more or less immediately find a higher band job in the health sector.  Meanwhile she is being busy doing interim

chose Ginos where I gorged on a very big pizza; something I am sure Suzy will
not be recommending to her patients next week haha.  We celebrated my award with a glass or two of
Lambrusco.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

Dolores were coming for lunch.  Finally
Fátima, our home help, was back from her 2 week holiday; although she went off
again this morning for the weekend.  But
that meant I would have help clearing the lunch.  I cooked though, as I love too when I am relaxed,
and made cream of carrot and potato soup followed by lamb casserole.  For dinner I made potato salad from my
grandfather’s recipe, handed down to me by my Mother. We had a grand day
together, sitting by the covered pool after lunch, having afternoon tea and
then going on our new walk with the dogs.
