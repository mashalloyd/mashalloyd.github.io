In the UK this weekend is a 4 day bank holiday for a very special occasion, the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. To think our 96 year old monarch has now been on the throne for 70 years and has become the longest reigning monarch in England. I would like to add she is still going strong but that is not quite true. The Queen now has mobility issues and has had to ration her appearance at all the events prepared for this most special occasion. I wish I could have been transported back to England to join my countrymen in the festivities and especially attend a street party. You see the Queen has been a constant in most people's lives;  at least for those of us who were born after 1952 and that is the majority. She was just 25 when her beloved father King George VI died and she became Queen, The Queen of England. There is no other. I just can't imagine another monarch at Buckingham Palace so we should appreciate every day she continues to reign. And, oh how well she has done that in my opinion and in the opinion of many.   I have only ever known one monarch, Queen Elizabeth II. My father, born in 1919, lived through 4 monarchs; George V, Edward VIII, George VI and Her Majesty the Queen. Shortly before he died, he remarked to me that she was "quite young". She was in fact 7 years younger than him, and born in 1926, like my father's dear sister, Gloria RIP. </span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">But before I carry on, let me rewind to last Sunday. This time last week we were still in Santa Pola. We had a pretty quiet time there really. I felt a bit lazy and last Sunday we hardly left the flat; although I did spend one quiet hour by the pool with my kindle. Coincidentally and very  appropriately I began  reading what is considered her definitive biography. Called<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Queen-Our-Times-Life-Elizabeth/dp/1529063418"> </a><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Queen-Our-Times-Life-Elizabeth/dp/1529063418">Queen of our times,  The Life of Elizabeth II</a>, it was written by royal expert Robert Hardman in her Jubilee year so it's very up to date. .  </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiUK5AmPPpNzdD9yNkBmmWd_rpSQpuzbcl_ydT6RMAbq59DsnYJy-6tf-ysNnE0bghTuUqW_H6qRNa7prY09ycV-R1CXsRoEW2Bxf3V1sj35YaqBVUc3WJZxWPUyk1OuhA54xkGt-k0xB62vr6Zbp6LYaPyYfBIhr8PDE3rYrNloqZ1OBS6tFs/s2560/Q%20of%20our%20times.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiUK5AmPPpNzdD9yNkBmmWd_rpSQpuzbcl_ydT6RMAbq59DsnYJy-6tf-ysNnE0bghTuUqW_H6qRNa7prY09ycV-R1CXsRoEW2Bxf3V1sj35YaqBVUc3WJZxWPUyk1OuhA54xkGt-k0xB62vr6Zbp6LYaPyYfBIhr8PDE3rYrNloqZ1OBS6tFs/w260-h400/Q%20of%20our%20times.jpg" width="260"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Appropriate reading this week</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">She was beautiful as a young woman wasn't she? Being a great fan I have read quite a few biographies. Is this the definitive one? I don't think so. It seems more to set out and correct The Crown's version of our monarchy which is maybe not a bad thing but it is not the best biography of the Royal family I have read. At the same time it is the story not just of her life but that of her country. As I was born in 1957 I remember nearly all the events in the biography of course. That is quite nostalgic at times. On the other hand the author goes all out to iron out any possible criticism of HM. I think he fawns a bit too much over her. I love her, but she is not without her faults as none of us are. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">As we didn't do much on Sunday, let me move on to <b>Monday</b> except that there is hardly anything to tell. The only interesting thing we did was do the food shopping and get new keys for the pool. If last year we had 3 keys when we arrived there was now only one left. Where did the others go I wonder?  Monday  was to be another quiet day but it turned out trumps when I finally found the solution to how the apartment and guests would be cared for in our absence. That was our mission there and it was important as I have about 14 bookings this summer and probably more to come.  Lucy, our neighbour, will continue to clean - she is so good - and I have found another lady who will take care of the guests. At the beginning Lucy will supervise her. But fingers crossed, all will be well. This weekend was the test. It was a test that we passed. Our guests told me they loved the apartment and that Lucy and Mar had been very attentive. Phew. </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Tuesday</b> was our last day at our apartment. It was quiet too but we did go out. I fancied the beach but Eladio didn't so I went along with his plans. We drove to the town of Santa Pola which Gran Alacant belongs to. It's about 5km away.  When we  went there apartment searching in 1999 we looked at Santa Pola first. It's a town resort which mostly caters to families. There are no high rise hotels  nor do package tours go there. Again, though, we are not town people and when we found Gran Alacant and the apartment and gardens with views of the sea we fell for it. We went to get some cash from the hole in the wall there which was actually an excuse to have a coffee in the main square where all the locals go. As in Callosa and Bolulla and most of the area, the main language is "valenciano", a bit similar to Catalán. We parked at the end of the port and walked past fishing boats - this is an important fishing port - as well as all the ferries leaving for the island of Tabarca but we were not to be one of the passengers that day. It was only 24ºc but felt like 34ºc, a bit too much for my liking. Here is Eladio (and Pippa) by the port as I had to have a photo to illustrate the moment for my blog.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYF7fFVz9wyA-MiOMlIQ0zCQxw17_crweE8EDZCNsxVm5s-VC_4PuucCGE0ht3GMwh_6LzOw5T-3gy0AZ3WmQTqGyGy8x7dFeNvSmtskTPReco6Vgl_v4V0mguvgwI2-RkN-m1UJqZ0cS3JzqW7Gn7ggajoEpKeWPJPgPuPQ0ePpzpb8GjWPI/s4032/E%20SP%20port.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYF7fFVz9wyA-MiOMlIQ0zCQxw17_crweE8EDZCNsxVm5s-VC_4PuucCGE0ht3GMwh_6LzOw5T-3gy0AZ3WmQTqGyGy8x7dFeNvSmtskTPReco6Vgl_v4V0mguvgwI2-RkN-m1UJqZ0cS3JzqW7Gn7ggajoEpKeWPJPgPuPQ0ePpzpb8GjWPI/w180-h400/E%20SP%20port.jpg" width="180"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio in Santa Pola with little Pippa on Tuesday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">I used to love the heat in Spain in the summer but I am realising slowly that perhaps I now prefer cooler temperatures. It was much cooler in Asturias but warm enough to sit outside at night so maybe my preferences are changing.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">We duly had our coffee at "Duende" in the main square where there were mostly locals but some other retired couples from elsewhere, such as ourselves. We do notice how, out of season, it is mostly retired people who travel. I often wonder why the marketeers of this world don't notice that it is actually the retired people who have no mortgages who have the extra cash (disposable income I think is the term) and are not going to kick the bucket as soon as they think. But they still advertise to younger people. We didn't spend much cash for our coffee, just 2.40 euros and the young girl who served us was tickled pink by my husband using his mobile to pay. She told me she didn't know how to pay with her mobile so I gave her a lesson. I remarked to Eladio that we have keep up with technology as we get older so as not to fall behind like many old people. Perhaps, that's why marketeers don't target them. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVqmcxv_WMEgNiKskRssTwDm5EOtEwYb7D3bibqi0gsNg1zw4L5tD_M91tdTVv64tTmrf7SYq3vg1OJSY-3fWOoooCZI3J7Efztigy1RJeJ7XCKH1Qy9Fk1DCCXYkixNUyCVEIzSdxf0gEvC8RnCAW4RKJJ9LfYfjrIQrNSlXr8NZsf9m1F-c/s4032/SP%20me%20coffee.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVqmcxv_WMEgNiKskRssTwDm5EOtEwYb7D3bibqi0gsNg1zw4L5tD_M91tdTVv64tTmrf7SYq3vg1OJSY-3fWOoooCZI3J7Efztigy1RJeJ7XCKH1Qy9Fk1DCCXYkixNUyCVEIzSdxf0gEvC8RnCAW4RKJJ9LfYfjrIQrNSlXr8NZsf9m1F-c/w400-h180/SP%20me%20coffee.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Enjoying my coffee with extra foam at Duende in Santa Pola on Tuesday morning</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">When I posted the photo on social media, my dear friend Sandra who had stayed with us recently, remarked that it was cold and raining in Brussels and she wished she was with me on the sunny terrace having a "café con leche" with extra "espuma" (foam). She noticed from her recent stay that that is how I always ask for my coffee, bless her.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Lunch was simple, grilled prawns with green beans and asparagus followed by fruit salad. We would eat a heartier meal for dinner as we went out on our last night. I was gutted to find out our favourite restaurant, María Picola, had closed permanently. Thus I had to search for a new restaurant. El Olivo, nearby, seemed to have the best reviews so that is where we went. Was it good? Well, yes and no, like the curate's egg (good in parts hahahaha). I liked the starter; grilled artichoke and the tartin for dessert but I'm afraid the entrecot, although huge, was dry and a bit tough. Will we go back? Probably not. But it was a nice end to our stay.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Wednesday</b> came and I was up at 6.40 or so, the day of our departure. I had been following Roland Garros, or specifically the new teenage sensation, Carlos Alcaraz, and of course Rafa Nadal who has lifted that trophy a staggering 13 times. Alcaraz is 19 and Nadal is now 36 and everyone says the former is Nadal's successor. But still Nadal is the better player or he was on Tuesday. Unfortunately Alcaraz lost to Zverez, the number 3 seed from Germany. Nadal was to play Djokovic in the Quarter Finals and all that meant on Tuesday night from around 9 pm which is late and it was cold and all the odds were on the Serb. Why? Because the conditions favoured him and because of Nadal's recent injuries and recurring foot problem. The first thing I did when I woke up was to check who had won. I expected it to be Djokovic, the world number 1. But no, once again, Nadal had worked his magic on the clay in Paris and beat him. The score was 6-2 4-6 6-2 7-7 so thankfully it did not go to 5 sets. Even so, it finished at past 1 in the morning which is madness. Thus Nadal and Zverez would meet in one of the semi finals on Friday and I and all of the crowd at Roland Garros would be rooting for him. We never expected the match to go the way it did - read on to find out what happened if you don't already know. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Another piece of news that pleased me was to hear that Bradford, the city where I lived from 1964 to 1981, had been <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-61648977">chosen as the UK City of Culture for 2025</a>. I am not sure it is the most cultural city in the UK but it has its saving graces. They don't, however, outweigh its image as a grim northern city with the fame of having the highest immigration percentage of the population in England. While I was there recently I was told that in the city, at least, it is 60% Pakistani. I hope any woke people reading this won't criticise me for mentioning that. I hope too that the award will help this maligned city to prosper and to put it on the map. I had no idea, by the way, that it is the 5th largest city in Britain. I don't much like the town centre, except for The Town Hall, St. George's Hall, the Cathedral, The Wool Exchange (now Waterstones). </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyyVsXG2UUOqAdQUqO2w-rlBde4DJP9HPgsjchpSHXUeo_jR9JKWHUBQlWB4hxRmY413XnaPSzIqNZ7--BQbOPiV9rn2rllOR7jRFQ4UZj3miFPxbYSs32spLEGey8_UB7DLmMKf1Jsd_EWHzyZ5X-RvERhlEeWH-XLIYODvHt0fu6BlvK9c4/s648/bradford_city_hall-e1548941115241.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="223" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyyVsXG2UUOqAdQUqO2w-rlBde4DJP9HPgsjchpSHXUeo_jR9JKWHUBQlWB4hxRmY413XnaPSzIqNZ7--BQbOPiV9rn2rllOR7jRFQ4UZj3miFPxbYSs32spLEGey8_UB7DLmMKf1Jsd_EWHzyZ5X-RvERhlEeWH-XLIYODvHt0fu6BlvK9c4/w400-h223/bradford_city_hall-e1548941115241.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The iconic City Hall in Bradford built in the 19th century in Venetian style</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">However,  I love the area where Bradford is located; West Yorkshire, so near to the wonderful Yorkshire Dales. Bradford also boasts The World Heritage site of Saltaire. It is a model village, absolutely intact, built by Sir Titus Salt who built it, away from the filthy centre of the city,  for the workers of his famous Mill.  The village was designed to cater for all its workers and their families' needs. So there was a hospital, a school, various churches, parks and brand new houses. However there was no pub as Sr. Titus was teetotal. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEguqCq5mW5xpNmbDF16CMC8MnI-fg1M1yz47fFB36ny3L6WPpMHB1JLCToPaDL-2Hrj1cBWOgXjC-xhQrWwfYxh6DofN9hvypo0xuipaA6NaHbs1IdkY0jUfsXlP8LqU35vuZDIFmR974KOhlwsKoEfVbeBPMeipkww3sX92-NtQtrZJcV3smM/s550/saltaire-village.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEguqCq5mW5xpNmbDF16CMC8MnI-fg1M1yz47fFB36ny3L6WPpMHB1JLCToPaDL-2Hrj1cBWOgXjC-xhQrWwfYxh6DofN9hvypo0xuipaA6NaHbs1IdkY0jUfsXlP8LqU35vuZDIFmR974KOhlwsKoEfVbeBPMeipkww3sX92-NtQtrZJcV3smM/w400-h300/saltaire-village.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Saltaire village</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">He was a complete pioneer when it came to looking after employees even if some of them were children aged 9. The Mill today is an arts museum and restaurant. We used to live nearby and I never thought much of the village but realise just what a marvel of living history it is today. The mill of course was for making wool and when we went to live in Bradford in 1964 it was a thriving industry and the workers still lived there.  So I lived through it being what it always was until it was closed in  1986. The famous Yorkshire stone terrace houses; mostly "two up and two down" were probably worth very little then but now must fetch enormous sums. I wrote that and then looked up the prices and actually they are not that high.  A medium sized terraced house in Salt's village fetches a price of around 250k pounds.Who would have guessed in the 60's that Salt's Village would become a World Heritage site or be part of the bid for Bradford to be named Cultural City for 2025? Not me. I would have thought it would be thanks to Bradford's other and bigger claim to fame, the nearby village of Haworth where the famous Brontë sisters lived and wrote their classic books. Both were part of the bid and both are the top places to visit when in Bradford. The third is the National Science and Film museum which I have never visited so can't judge. I would have added the amazing curry houses, all so authentic but I suppose that is quite common place in the UK now. In any case,  well done Bradford. </div><div><p style="text-align: justify;">I didn't comment any of this to Suzy or Eladio who probably would not have been very interested. In any case we were busy that morning getting ready to leave which would take a while. Just before we set off we gave Lucy the keys and talked over for a final time how she and the other lady would care for the guests and the apartment. I left feeling it was in good hands. I also thanked Lucy for looking after my daughter so well since she went to live there last year. She was coming back with us to Madrid and I hope all goes well for her.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It was a long journey and Eladio and Suzy took turns to drive. We were home after 5 pm and all was quiet with no sign of our 5 guests. Lucy was there to greet us - our other Lucy - who looks after us and the house so well. We soon settled in and at about 8pm were sitting round the table on the kitchen patio having a quiet and simple dinner. I didn't sleep badly and was up at 6.40 the next day, <b>Thursday</b>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thursday marked the first day of the 4 day bank holiday to celebrate the Queen's Jubilee.

I would miss each and every one of the events. Unfortunately the Queen would too because of "discomfort" but would be able to see everything on the TV from Windsor Castle. Not being able to get the BBC in Spain, I would miss it all and felt very much out of everything. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">The event that marked the beginning of the celebrations, the famous Trooping of the Colour in honour of the Monarch's official birthday, started at 10 am and the Queen was able to watch it from the balcony with her cousin the Duke of Kent. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhAM7PYJMmhIBJxW0w9UUAF90VQ4yZtNEMEotZ0-69fm3bsCLl0mKgZfqVhRUXbNWDUqc4cqtTCYQTg4s1XOWZWWBLT3Wq1EYI-ryKa4h6EeTy6849bgd19fiihoS96V_qwvI6x4IcX5BeZLB0wyl9emMtNk8YIVOx37MmKFDDbZi5s6JX5K9M/s800/Trooping%20The%20Colour%20090618%20MOD.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhAM7PYJMmhIBJxW0w9UUAF90VQ4yZtNEMEotZ0-69fm3bsCLl0mKgZfqVhRUXbNWDUqc4cqtTCYQTg4s1XOWZWWBLT3Wq1EYI-ryKa4h6EeTy6849bgd19fiihoS96V_qwvI6x4IcX5BeZLB0wyl9emMtNk8YIVOx37MmKFDDbZi5s6JX5K9M/w400-h225/Trooping%20The%20Colour%20090618%20MOD.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Trooping of the colour</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">Then there was a fly past which watched by key royals from the balcony again, so the Queen appeared for a second time.

All eyes were on Meghan but she did not steal the Queen's thunder. No one could. Someone told me that a poll showed 70% of people support the monarchy in the UK but 80% support the Queen.

Instead Eladio and I went to one of the branches of Spain's flagship store, El Corte Inglés on an important mission. It was to buy Eladio a new suit. I have to explain. He has suits, quite a few of them but they were bought over 20 years ago and are no longer in fashion. The one he wore for my father's memorial service was not suitable and even my husband who is not at all clothes conscious realised. He compared his suit to Bradford Grammar School Headmaster's at the Memorial Service for my father apparently. The main excuse to get a new suit is that we have a wedding to attend on 2nd July, so off we went to El Corte Inglés that morning. We have never spent so much on clothes and it goes against my grain but there was not much option if we are to even begin to try and compete with self respecting Spaniards at weddings. After trying a few options, we found the best was from Calvin Klein (imagine!!!). But it really was the best and my husband will look great on 2nd July.</div></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhf4_zVoVjCxDfMiEr-L1keiEtSXIzeCz6tIkV4-eyigeMZu2ern7iWtYyeakQuHeExZzYYhtk-hnSGQKzBEWGSNB-LNKmoqi_HN89gl5K4Pyvsj5oljJwie6XG4UHGH4BMf7JCUVoohcUTU0PlJY9yEEE-3GPSw4KTJCgezP_0cUH5t0jAsw8/s4032/E%20trying%20on%20suit.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhf4_zVoVjCxDfMiEr-L1keiEtSXIzeCz6tIkV4-eyigeMZu2ern7iWtYyeakQuHeExZzYYhtk-hnSGQKzBEWGSNB-LNKmoqi_HN89gl5K4Pyvsj5oljJwie6XG4UHGH4BMf7JCUVoohcUTU0PlJY9yEEE-3GPSw4KTJCgezP_0cUH5t0jAsw8/w180-h400/E%20trying%20on%20suit.jpg" width="180"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio being fitted for his new suit, the first in more than 20 years</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">We both laughed later when we remarked that this suit would do for both weddings and funerals and would be the last one he owns in this life, hahahahaha.

I have put on weight and any possible dress I have for a wedding (and I don't) no longer fits. If I am a little overweight the best shaped dresses for me are tunic shaped, just above the knees and with what they call French sleeves - to cover up my ghastly arms. I must have looked at 100 dresses and there were only 2 I liked that looked ok on me - a bit flowing I am afraid to cover all the curves. That dress will do though for all sizes so hopefully it will do for any future weddings too. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We then went to get toys for the children who we would be reunited with that afternoon.

I love to watch her development. We left for dinner at around 8 pm and had scrambled eggs on toast on the kitchen terrace. Entertainment that night was starting the new season of Borgen - that Danish sort of West Wing which I really find entertaining.</div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Friday</b> dawned and I woke up at 6.20. It was to be a wonderful day but I didn't know it. It started off with a shopping expedition with Eladio and Suzy. We had to fill the cupboards and fridge for our absence from Wednesday when we will be off again - this time to Montrondo.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I watched Eladio choosing fruit and vegetables which these days are now weighed at cash out. That got me thinking of the absurd idea that Boris Johnson and his "mates" have of bringing back the Imperial system of pounds and ounces and more, most of which are very complicated. In 1999 the UK adopted the Metric system but kept some of the easiest of Imperial measurement units,  After the country has got used to the metric system for most weights and measurements, bringing back the Imperial system with all its complications seems like regressing instead of progressing. Maybe he is caught up in nostalgia for the past what with the Jubilee celebrations and of course harping back to the Empire after damned Brexit. I well remember as a child having to learn nearly all of them. It's all quite easy to understand inches, feet, yards and miles or ounces, pounds and stones, fluid ounces, pints and gallons but try furlongs, chains, links, fathom, shackle, cable, etc.  Kids today in England would look pretty blank if they had to measure in feet and inches, so used are they to the metric system. I caught my husband who has only ever known the metric system like most of the world, on camera as he did his fruit shopping. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRwMsKNFDAs_wDv9ireDge7Ta85r4_s_cqAImmgL8hhgvHQH0GlduVxuvQWZi8whtH__C2tDdnARAKK8o1JFMe1BODD_TLWdCcFFLJwBIm9WfGSuToixrzr772Jg1zz67zTVJajH4Z20DNgsw-tK5ChTQ6jKYetTwphhlv1MjKtsxa8adXThY/s4032/E%20Mercadona.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRwMsKNFDAs_wDv9ireDge7Ta85r4_s_cqAImmgL8hhgvHQH0GlduVxuvQWZi8whtH__C2tDdnARAKK8o1JFMe1BODD_TLWdCcFFLJwBIm9WfGSuToixrzr772Jg1zz67zTVJajH4Z20DNgsw-tK5ChTQ6jKYetTwphhlv1MjKtsxa8adXThY/w400-h180/E%20Mercadona.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio shopping at Mercadona on Friday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">While wondering around the aisles at Mercadona I kept thinking of what was happening in the UK that day. The major event was the Thanksgiving service at St. Paul's Cathedral and then a lunch at Guildhall for the Royal family. The one person absent of course was the Queen. What little I saw of the Jubilee had me thinking is this the last time we shall see her on the Royal balcony? People all around the country were holding Jubilee street parties. I should have got my act together to at least put on a Jubilee afternoon tea at home but then my family would have thought I was a bit bananas. As the girls were not born in the UK, although they are very attached to the country, they are not particularly interested in the British royal family, like I am. Friends kept posting or sending me photos of their garden parties. Someone commented something along the lines of "you should see my neighbour's garden, they are doing great justice to the drinking ability of the late Queen Mother" - as we all know how fond she was of her drink. I am sure the Jubilee celebrations were the greatest occasion for many, many Brits to get completely "plastered". My countrymen, do generally, like their drink and are part of what is known as the "silent drinkers" except that this bank holiday they can come out in the open and drink to their heart's content. I wonder what the trade for Prosecco was this weekend, not to mention beer and gin tonic. Some would have drunk tea and some coffee - which would have been my choice. </div><div style="text-align: justify;">We  went to Alverán for our coffee - "café con leche" - where we were served by Abel. Later, our horrible ex squatter, Felipe Turover, turned up. We were disgusted to see him there but I am  damned if I will stop going to my favourite cafe because of him. We totally ignored him of course. Suzy remarked that he can't be penniless as he claims, if he goes there every day for breakfast. That's food for thought. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Yes food. After a flying stop at Carrefour for a few more items, we came home with the food to be unpacked and between Lucy, Suzy and myself we did the job. It was not to be a quiet afternoon as Oli and family were coming to spend the afternoon and evening with us. As our Chinese guests were out and don't use the pool we would have it to ourselves. It was to be Elliot's first bathe of the season and Juliet's first bathe ever. Oli and family arrived early just as I was finishing my siesta.

We kept checking the score and then saw 7-6 (to Nadal) and 6-6 and the word "walkaway". It took a while to understand what it meant. The term refers to a player withdrawing during a match and conceding the win to his opponent. 25 year old Sasha Zverez, born in Germany to Russian parents, had twisted his ankle badly during the tie break in the second set. He had to leave in a wheel chair and went into the locker room to cry. Poor guy.  His chances, and he had them, were dashed by this awful injury which had him crying out in pain. He  came back later on crutches to shake the hand of the umpire. This means Nadal who celebrated his 36th birthday in Friday, is through to the final and what could be his 14th trophy if he beats 23 year old Denmark's Ruud today. But  it is not the way he would have liked to have reached it. Nadal had nothing but kind words of sympathy for his rival who he said would go on to win many grand slams. Paris had been his chance to win his first but it was not to be. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">My girls were not aware of the Jubilee celebrations in the UK - well Oli was a bit as she is as journalist and her programme sent a colleague to London. But we did have a sort of afternoon tea but not with cakes, etc. Oli had brought popcorn and Suzy served us fruit juice, kiwis and walnuts which was the nearest I got to a street party. But we did have a splendid dinner. Lucy stayed this weekend and made us Spanish omelet which we had with salad and croquettes. I have to say a good day was had by all. That's all I want in life, peace and a happy family and I got it that day.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Saturday dawned and we had no plans. But I had a task and that was to get a new cable for my iPad pro which was broken. I had ordered one on Amazon but it would take too long to come. Thus we went to the Apple Store at Gran Plaza 2. It was another excuse to have coffee out together, always the highlight of our mornings. We were well attended at the impressive Apple Store and I walked out with my new cable thoroughly satisfied by the service. I took a look at the new iPad pros - they measure 12.9 inches. I could see the new ones were smaller than mine but the screen is the same size. Mine was one of the best presents I ever got while I worked for Yoigo and it is still going strong.  I use it daily to read the news in the morning as well as to watch series in bed sometimes. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">My other task was to get Suzy's room - the one which that horrible squatter, Felipe Turover, occupied illegally for months, ready for new guests. Two American girls, Emily and her friend, were coming yesterday night and will be spending 4 days here. It had to be perfect and it was. I took some photos to show you and to show Emily who was traveling with her friend from London.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj7zlnWiBFYaDrcCSGSDm3si3yZlG-wyXU1lcQaBMzse_L2wa2T9uw3CuiZLOHAKVIGqyUb5ySwZ5Ysc9jkhL-mZGnqgxR68bySr0MnmOQiT_NXJ07Q7-Mrn7wT8WTEqsOckwC4a1FOlVAMpk5K16ez8p4GIIlNKaw9DnEzYpIw5gdxhExvjEg/s4032/Room.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj7zlnWiBFYaDrcCSGSDm3si3yZlG-wyXU1lcQaBMzse_L2wa2T9uw3CuiZLOHAKVIGqyUb5ySwZ5Ysc9jkhL-mZGnqgxR68bySr0MnmOQiT_NXJ07Q7-Mrn7wT8WTEqsOckwC4a1FOlVAMpk5K16ez8p4GIIlNKaw9DnEzYpIw5gdxhExvjEg/w400-h180/Room.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyrif1QtHlNcI45DGes5sjMct1-yHYITw5VwadOXW87R83dika6Fi0cEtgrPoMD_Mzev3GZJxIfkzoqrUjleG-FOr6jzjSiGzhEC53jRAjQlql65KC9wHjQ097tKpQgThnJrwAxVoTG13dfXMRKJxKa-OmkZUUlU2sE_Nclrl7WMpaahsFnqw/s4032/Close%20up.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgyrif1QtHlNcI45DGes5sjMct1-yHYITw5VwadOXW87R83dika6Fi0cEtgrPoMD_Mzev3GZJxIfkzoqrUjleG-FOr6jzjSiGzhEC53jRAjQlql65KC9wHjQ097tKpQgThnJrwAxVoTG13dfXMRKJxKa-OmkZUUlU2sE_Nclrl7WMpaahsFnqw/w400-h180/Close%20up.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiv8zBUIlq_o3CxnvJxzE-jVbkLrhYxL8cawkLmxEtudfoOHz8gUPhf3UrN8d7uGsjavkoq-i6JsjNN5uRox01XPZOEM7z4R9Z8qO2b3TlxrdP5M9hyI7LJsh0TcQTXsFBfqVxCzsba4zv32achxAp7byfB9tuG4Fl5GgnvIPbH9JMsO-rByIs/s4032/Ensuite.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiv8zBUIlq_o3CxnvJxzE-jVbkLrhYxL8cawkLmxEtudfoOHz8gUPhf3UrN8d7uGsjavkoq-i6JsjNN5uRox01XPZOEM7z4R9Z8qO2b3TlxrdP5M9hyI7LJsh0TcQTXsFBfqVxCzsba4zv32achxAp7byfB9tuG4Fl5GgnvIPbH9JMsO-rByIs/w180-h400/Ensuite.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The room ready for our new guests with a goody corner including wine, almonds and fruit. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">As they were arriving late that night we would have the pool to ourselves again.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I made "cocido" stew for lunch which is a bit heavy but my husband loves it.

The main events of the day were the Epsom Derby race which no doubt the Queen would have loved to attend, and the open air concert at Buckingham Palace which she watched from the comfort of Windsor Castle wearing her "comfy clothes" apparently. But she did appear you see. In a recorded clip, she appears with Paddington Bear in a sketch where they have tea together at Buckingham Palace.  It is absolutely marvelous. Have you seen it?

It's from the Daily Mail - not my favourite rag but the only place I could find the full length video. It's imbedded in the article but easy to find.
