I'm holding a bottle of typical Asturian cider in my hands. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Good morning my friends. Well, here we are in Asturias at the old house we bought back in 2020. It's usually fully booked at this time of year but someone cancelled a while back and I decided to take those days for ourselves.  And, we are happy to be back in this marvelous part of the country on the north coast of Spain, in between the beaches of Llanes and the Picos de Europa mountain range. If today temperatures will not rise above 20ºc, back home in Madrid mercury will be above 35. So, it's good to get away from the heat. </p><p>It's been a very quiet week. We have enjoyed both Montrondo and El Cuetu and most of the time we were on our own. We hardly followed the news which is maybe a good thing. If I was in the UK, I would be avidly watching Wimbledon but from here in Asturias all I can do is to check the progress of Carlos Alcaraz, the number 1 seed. He is doing well but my bets are on Djokovic winning again. I am also aware that both my country, the UK, and my adopted country, Spain, were playing each other in the Under 21 Euro Final. It was  taking place in Batumi, Georgia, which we visited a while ago on our road trip. Now, most football fans in the world will also know where it is. The teams will have flown from Istanbul to Batumi, so will not have experienced the awful roads in that country. All I can say, in the spirit of British fair play, is that may the best team win. I later read England won, so they must have been the better team or had more luck. Actually they deserved to win as Spain is the five time winner of this trophy which England has only won once in 1984.  Funny, that it is only really sport that has interested me on the news this week.</p><p>This time last week  we were still  in Montrondo. We had a bit of a cold spate until last Sunday when the weather got warmer and was pleasant for the rest of our stay. That morning Eladio and Juan, our nephew, set about dealing with the overgrown grass at the front of the houses. Eladio used his father's scythe and Juan used a modern lawn mower. Here they are together enjoying their work.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrB7jIZwdy-nAj9PQljsdm7avDmVdEKGQJbERZbUPYNz10s1pjPPrJS-TXKw1ivYz1DoIwUTOGnrXO56DriIodONfGlJLc0Jfj0rEiOf_6b-N_mGfFg9BPnH5D94cQEnmkv0bi7rJxuzVD0y_XzJb3vOi5Udgux03bwtJ_sr-Tv6LhQ1bNztDEsw/s4032/20230702_114113.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrB7jIZwdy-nAj9PQljsdm7avDmVdEKGQJbERZbUPYNz10s1pjPPrJS-TXKw1ivYz1DoIwUTOGnrXO56DriIodONfGlJLc0Jfj0rEiOf_6b-N_mGfFg9BPnH5D94cQEnmkv0bi7rJxuzVD0y_XzJb3vOi5Udgux03bwtJ_sr-Tv6LhQ1bNztDEsw/w400-h180/20230702_114113.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Juan and Eladio cutting the grass - Eladio the old fashioned way with a scythe and Juan, his nephew with a modern grass cutter. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>I didn't have to cook that day as we had leftover cocido, so off I went for a walk with Pippa along the old path to Murias. It was just gorgeous. I had to take a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDQNpeGV4HE">video</a> to share with you. .I love this time in Montrondo when everything is so beautiful, green, lush and bucolic. I enjoyed the flowers, the views, the sound of the small river, the butterflies and above all the wild flowers in all their summer glory and all this to the backdrop of mountains thickly populated with my father's favourite tree,  birch trees. I kept stopping to take photos and upload them to social media.

I wondered afterwards if they made it as the path to the summit is not easy to find.</p><p>Pippa enjoyed every moment of the beautiful walk and once home she rushed into her "father's" arms to greet him.

He is just one year older than Suzy and we have known him since the day he was born. We share the same birthday, 8th February. Lunch was leftovers but dinner was a Montrondo classic; friend eggs and chips which I made on the Aga which made them taste even better. </p><p>I can't remember what we watched that night on Netflix but I remember we went to bed around midnight and again I woke up at 8.30 the next day. I slept like a baby in Montrondo. I wonder why.</p><p><b>Monday</b> came and I had things to do. First I had to contact my guest in El Cuetu and our wifi provider, Adamo after Internet was cut off last Saturday. To cut a long story short, it turns out the fiber cables had been cut by sabotage - no one knows who did it - and by the end of the day wifi was back. I hoped this network outage wouldn't affect my guest's evaluation on Airbnb of her stay at our place in Asturias. While managing that, I was in touch with the key holder and cleaner in Santa Pola as the administration had decided to change locks for the outside gate and the swimming pool, without giving residents a chance to get new keys before the change happened. Thankfully my dear neighbour Lucy had it all sorted just before new guests arrived. That was a close shave. The last important task was to contact the Electrolux repair centre in León as our new induction hub stopped working shortly after we arrived in Montrondo. I took a video and was soon able to send it to the technician. He is supposed to be installing a new hub in our absence. Meanwhile, I used the range cooker which makes for lovely meals but takes a long time to heat up. Finally, I took care of guests at home; 4 leaving and 3 new guests coming. I was glad to have Suzy there to help Tana with the transitions and getting room ready. <br></br></p><p>The final important task was more food shopping in Villablino. That meant I wouldn't have much time to make lunch so decided on buying lamb chops which Eladio could grill on the BBQ! We enjoyed a quiet coffee in the town before doing our shopping at Gadis, an excellently stocked supermarket. Here is Eladio waiting for his.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhlwQWiTr3oOdM2LBuvVff4CvEGWEHI3zSL9mo4RB7IVAn7yry3w9Wxh0565ecGnBk4_-UNDdORf5oiRpg4pFIHFYugiTun43IoCVISnkgwqz7ZVjscAgvcFaGqvnmca-0TSZNIjj3mi5CioG2pJWLW89MtwCqrRaktMvLGGAP404fs0_IIi641vA/s4032/20230703_114822.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhlwQWiTr3oOdM2LBuvVff4CvEGWEHI3zSL9mo4RB7IVAn7yry3w9Wxh0565ecGnBk4_-UNDdORf5oiRpg4pFIHFYugiTun43IoCVISnkgwqz7ZVjscAgvcFaGqvnmca-0TSZNIjj3mi5CioG2pJWLW89MtwCqrRaktMvLGGAP404fs0_IIi641vA/w180-h400/20230703_114822.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Coffee time in Villablino</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><p>We were home on good time for lunch and here is my husband grilling the chops which we enjoyed with Juan, our nephew.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiepq_tWVI410yFDy415JxXbV5MVjF4y4B7tqUmy1OPyEgRi7NzBIzDXwe-IwiCulX-p094dFHPktrYDKe1oKmF3ZVK481_dkgEIHL8apwOxRppX7UaMZlEKX5GsNoh6oz00xKWY_CRWq7loadmJ761qh_t9vZUTKUZOtI8wS94-n-i_43xJAuq5w/s4032/20230703_141509.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiepq_tWVI410yFDy415JxXbV5MVjF4y4B7tqUmy1OPyEgRi7NzBIzDXwe-IwiCulX-p094dFHPktrYDKe1oKmF3ZVK481_dkgEIHL8apwOxRppX7UaMZlEKX5GsNoh6oz00xKWY_CRWq7loadmJ761qh_t9vZUTKUZOtI8wS94-n-i_43xJAuq5w/w400-h180/20230703_141509.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Barbecue time in Montrondo</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The afternoon was task free and I spent it lazily reading under the shade of the apple tree. It was then that one of Miguel's friends - a TV cameraman - sent me some more photos and videos of "the" wedding. The one I had wanted to share with you - and now I can - is where Olivia says "no" - but soon says "yes". She told the public she couldn't resist doing so. It had us all in stitches and livened up an otherwise boring registry wedding. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfTkj3QJqkM">This is it </a>if you haven't already seen it on my social media pages. But I didn't laugh so much when later a friend posted a news clip of another bride saying no and then yes but on that occasion the judge stopped the ceremony and cancelled the wedding. Imagine! She was told in no uncertain terms that getting married was a serious matter, not to be joked about. Gosh!</p><p>I shared it with the family and with Juan over dinner which was home made soup with a pie bought from Gadis which never in my life could I have made as well.</p><p>That night we watched the film "Lone Survivor" on Netlix. It's based on a true story about the Seals in Afghanistan and involves a lot of shooting. </p><p>Again that night I slept nearly 8 hours and woke up just before 8 am on <b>Tuesday</b> morning. We spent most of the morning washing linen, cooking and hoovering. I made "spagbol" for lunch which we had alone as Juan had gone to León for the day. While we were doing that, Oli and family were making their way back from Cádiz after 8 nights at a luxury resort. I wondered whether Elliot wanted to go home or not. I wouldn't if I had been him after 8 days of such fun as there were lots of activities for kids, the sea and the hotel pool which was more like a water park. </p><p>I spent my last afternoon reading under the shade of the apple tree in the back garden of our house in Montrondo until it was time for dinner when Juan joined us. I have never seen my husband so talkative as that night after his nephew asked him about his years as a priest and teacher. He told him his life story. I was the one who chipped in at times to add a bit of emotion hahahaha.</p><p>Netflix disappointed that night with The Patriot starring Mel Gibson so we turned to a new documentary/drama "Awaking the Titanic" about 14 people from the same village in Ireland who took that voyage. Only 3 survived to tell the tale. Like many people,  I am fascinated with the Titanic. But I got interrupted by a potential guest asking lots of questions about our house in Madrid which led nowhere apart from spoiling my entertainment.</p><p>All too soon it was <b>Wednesday</b>, the day we were leaving for Asturias. It is a 2.5h drive as, although, Asturias is the next province to León, it is still quite far, especially because our place here is located on the eastern part of the coast (towards Santander). Here is a map where you can see our route from Villablino (near Montrondo and on the yellow part of  Castilla León) to El Cuetu near  Llanes (our region of Asturias) in the upper right corner. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhnUY8Rd7nNhvB5uNrh8HyDhKq5L0WVfuYsoBj-xlJhB-GohWTUshd6tTxn_gLb9Gmr3-iitDW5Kf7okFrPPtbOUYiGmHF1PhTr4clGPIxYRcNuynXP7Vb1Z1_zklgn-x6UfW7aCqb2C_6tIM9jf9oYaAx5zEZkWuyRM3GLHenMl4na3j9xMGd6PQ/s768/Mapa-pol%C3%ADtico-de-Asturias-1-768x370.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="193" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhnUY8Rd7nNhvB5uNrh8HyDhKq5L0WVfuYsoBj-xlJhB-GohWTUshd6tTxn_gLb9Gmr3-iitDW5Kf7okFrPPtbOUYiGmHF1PhTr4clGPIxYRcNuynXP7Vb1Z1_zklgn-x6UfW7aCqb2C_6tIM9jf9oYaAx5zEZkWuyRM3GLHenMl4na3j9xMGd6PQ/w400-h193/Mapa-pol%C3%ADtico-de-Asturias-1-768x370.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Map of Asturias</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>We didn't leave early so as to give time to Loli to clean, change the sheets and prepare the house for us. I sincerely hoped she would do a better job than she did for the English guests who complained. I was worried too about the Spanish guests leaving that day after having suffered the Internet outage which, although not my fault, they could easily blame me for. I was right to worry; the lady gave me 3 out of 5 complaining about cables!! </p><p>We arrived at around 7 pm to perfect weather and to quite a clean house - at least she had had a go at the windows. After a bit of inspection, I wondered what guests were complaining about. They probably want a spanking new house or apartment right by the beach. Well, they should look elsewhere. Eladio and I love it and were happy to be "home" again. </p><p>I slept well and woke up to a quiet village.  Once again we were waking up in a different house and a different province, like being on the road again, except that everything was familiar. It appeared lots of the other holiday homes were not full either; owing I was told to the "San Fermines" - the bull run fiesta in Pamplona which I hate. That was fine with me.

It was market day which I love and the square was groaning with people and enticing stalls. I bought a meat pie and some kitchen towels. I would have loved to stay longer but it was coffee time and we wanted to have it by the Playa de Poó at the restaurant bar called <a href="https://lafaroladelmarllanes.com/">La Farola del Mar</a> which is just above the beach. We love that place. You may laugh at the name but not at the beach which is my favourite in the area. It's more an estuary and when the tide is out, it forms little pools where children can paddle and you can walk all the way to the beginning of the village. When the tide is in, it's like an emerald coloured lake with virtually no waves as it is sheltered on both sides by cliffs. The Guardian included it in its ranking of the top 40 beaches in Europe in 2019 and of course alluded to its unfortunate name. Another beach with an unfortunate name they included is Playa de los Muertos (Death Beach!), also in Spain.  During our time this week in El Cuetu we went 3 times in 2 days which is quite a record. </p><p>That morning, as most mornings, the tide was out and the sea far away.

We had the lovely meat pie I had bought at the market. I thought it was locally sourced but my neighbour told me it's from León - oh well. We then watched a film about women spies in WW2 working for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations_Executive">SOE</a> who helped resistance movements in German occupied countries. It's quite a coincidence as both in Montrondo and here in Asturias that has been the subject of my reading. Unfortunately though I fell asleep as I often do when we watch TV at night.

You are probably wondering why I mention bag pipes. Well, this area is Celtic, something you might not have known, just as Galicia is too. There are 8 Celtic regions which are all in the UK, Ireland and Spain: Ireland, Scotland, Isle of Man, Wales, Cornwall, Brittany, as well as Galicia and Asturias. </div><div><br></br><div>Maybe we could have joined the fiesta, seen the procession with the floral offering and more people in regional dress, but we preferred a quiet morning by the beach. So off we went yet again to Poo Beach. There we had coffee overlooking a semi crowded but very quiet beach. It  is much favoured by families as the sea is shallow here and nearly wave free. After our coffee we walked to a spot nearer the water. Unbelievably, my husband joined me in the water and he too remarked just how warm it was. The sea was warm but the sky was dark and at around 1.30 it startled to rain slightly; a sort of drizzle. The name for this type of very light rain in northern Spain  is   "chirimiri", whereas  in Asturias it is often referred to as  "orbayu; the Castillian word being "llovizna".  Asturias, which is possibly the wettest area in Spain, has many names for different types of rain just as Finns have lots of different names for snow!</div><div><br></br></div><div>When the "orbayu" came, people picked up their things and left, just as we did. Thankfully, it wasn't cold. We came home to have a shower and our lunch - freshly made cream of carrot and pumpkin soup, followed by the rest of my boeuf stroganof. </div><div><br></br></div><div>There was no sitting on the terrace that afternoon because of the "orbayu". Instead, I went to bed with my kindle and Pippa and slept for about an hour. After his siesta, Eladio set about covering up the grime that accumulates in between the bathroom tiles that the English lady had complained about. We had bought a special product and I was so happy it worked. Today he will be cleaning all the windows, hahahaha. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We had a dinner table booked that night at Playa de Poo -  of course. We were not able to sit on table number 14 as it was raining - boohoo. What a pity. When we arrived the beach was practically empty as you can see from the photo below. You may also see there were people bathing in it even though it was raining slightly. I think if we had had our bathing costumes with us, we may have gone in too. There is nothing nicer than swimming in the rain if it is not cold which it wasn't. This was the view from our table. </div><div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZOzWZWVcpwHeW1YQ1oWYr8O7JaaKqHvOpcljJbohdlYCz9WSt7cS8RA3xyPADaYcaVuGPJbcjtjj7vXHD0iOQmVKaAxxBiYUaD4QKHz7aadKV532xJ3yfK5JH2GfNYhtouYIa883DiTfxFDNhiSqIE208y_Fky13yF5cPMzSIUV__4gszFBXO8g/s4032/20230708_202537.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjZOzWZWVcpwHeW1YQ1oWYr8O7JaaKqHvOpcljJbohdlYCz9WSt7cS8RA3xyPADaYcaVuGPJbcjtjj7vXHD0iOQmVKaAxxBiYUaD4QKHz7aadKV532xJ3yfK5JH2GfNYhtouYIa883DiTfxFDNhiSqIE208y_Fky13yF5cPMzSIUV__4gszFBXO8g/w400-h180/20230708_202537.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>View from our table at La Farola del Mar above Poo Beach</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We were served by Juan but were in bad luck as far as the cuisine went as the normal chef was not there.

That is my kind of bliss.</p><p>On that note, I shall leave you now until next Sunday. Where will that find us you may wonder. You will find out next week. Cheers till then,</p><p>Masha. </p><p><br></br></p><p><br></br></p></div></div></div>
