<span>Hello again
everyone,</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>Last time I wrote, some two weeks ago, I was so
immersed in my father’s stay in hospital and his recovery there was not much
time for anything else. It was a very stressful period and I must admit it got
me down more than I would have wanted.  I
found myself crying in bed or in the car and nothing else mattered except my
Father’s wellbeing.  Eladio and I took
turns to spend the night with him and the girls and Olga often spent the
afternoons with him and Suzy spent one night too.  Someone had to be
with him always.  I was determined for
him to eat and get strong and the only way to do so was to bring enticing food
made at home for his meals in lieu of the institutional and unappetizing
hospital food. We shared a room with another family looking after their
grandfather and we were often a comfort to each other.  Rosa and her daughter Lidia will remain in my
memories of our time at the Hospital de Alcorcón.  </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>Grandpa was operated on his hip on Thursday 13<sup>th</sup>
October and on Tuesday 18<sup>th</sup> took his first steps with a zimmer frame
with the help of Paqui, the charming physiotherapist at the hospital.  There are so many people to thank but at the top
of the list comes Rocio’s father, Juan Ignacio, the head anesthetist at the
hospital.  He has been instrumental in
care for my Father from the moment we entered the emergency unit and is still organizing
all his after care and rehabilitation since we’ve come home.  I want to thank my friends on Facebook for
all their support and prayers and for Fátima, Julio and Manolo for coming to
see him too and for all the phone calls from Eladio’s family.   </span></div>

<span>We finally came home on Thursday 20<sup>th</sup>
October.  Amazingly our return coincided
with the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15389550">death of Gaddafi</a>, stories of which dominated the world’s news for the
next few days.  In Spain, however, even
bigger news that day was the permanent cease fire announcement from the Basque
terrorist group ETA.  I for one, however,
do not believe them and would prefer to see them disbanding and laying down
their arms.  In any case, the biggest
news for us that day was my Father’s return home which would mark his road to
recovery, to his ability to walk again, something we are all determined will
happen sooner or later.  Of course he
uses a wheel chair most of the time but exercises in the mornings and
afternoons with the zimmer frame with the help of Eladio.  Also he goes by ambulance three afternoons a
week with Olga to the hospital for physiotherapy.  Finally he is experiencing less and less and
pain and as a consequence his appetite is back as well as his zest for life and
things going on around him.  He is back
to his routine, reading the Daily Telegraph, his Russian books, enjoying his
food, sleeping the siesta, watching the BBC news and generally being part of
the family.  </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>The night he came home, was an important night
for Olivia and I wish I could have been with her but it just wasn’t possible as
I had to be at work for a meeting.  She
was acting as an MC for the regional final in Madrid of the <a href="http://www.u4energy.eu/web/guest;jsessionid=9DA72359F08E07F742287E969ECFD810">U4Energy </a>pan
European school competition on energy education organized by the European
Union.  The contact came from my friend
Sandie who lives in Brussels and to whom I am very grateful as the organizers
were so happy with Olivia’s performance that night that they have asked her to
be the MC at the final in Brussels on 22<sup>nd</sup> November.  There she will be sharing the stage with the
EU Commissioner for Energy and I know she will do another “ace job” to quote
the organizers. Well done Oli.  </span></div>

<span>Oli continues to work for her TV programme, La
Mañana de la 1, and she appears most weeks doing live reports but sadly never
remembers to tell us.  We missed one appearance while we were at the hospital when she interviewed Gerry and Kate,
the parents of the missing girl Madeleine, on the occasion of the presentation
of <a href="//draft.blogger.com/%20http://www.amazon.co.uk/Madeleine-Kate-McCann/dp/0593067916/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320145408&amp;sr=1-1">Kate McCann’s book</a> in Spanish. 
Funnily enough this was the first time Olivia has used English on screen
on TVE1.  This is a story that touches my
heart and just as I was writing the above, I clicked on Amazon.es and ordered
the book in English.  Amazon.es only
launched recently and I don’t know how they are doing.  What I do know is that they are extremely
efficient and my book will arrive this Friday with free delivery.   I am sure when I read it that it will break
my heart.  </span></div>

<span>If Olivia is due some congratulations, so is
Suzy.  Suzy has been made a full time
employee of Aramark and now has bigger responsibilities such as taking care of
special diets at the private Zarzuela clinic in Aravaca. I have yet to see her
with her white hospital gown but I am still very proud of her.  Well done Suzy too.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>Whilst my Father was in hospital, I had to
continue working of course, so always took my PC to his room when I was
accompanying him.  I had to go to the
office too on various occasions. The day before we came home it was the
TeliaSonera’s (Yoigo’s main shareholder) quarterly results announcement and we
were to share them with the staff in a Yoigo Morning.  The news was good for Yoigo, nearly 3 million
customers and still EBITDA positive. 
There was more good news to be shared too the next day when we got this
year’s customer satisfaction results from EPSI rating’s study on the mobile
telecoms sector.  Yoigo has the most
satisfied customers in the Spanish market. 
Juggling being at the hospital, going home for my Father’s food and to
and from the office was not the easiest of tasks and had me pretty
exhausted.  Thank goodness it only lasted
just over a week.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>Last Friday, the day after we came back from
hospital, I had an early morning meeting at the office which meant getting up
at 6 to avoid the traffic!  But there was
more juggling/organizing to do as Sasha (my cousin) and his Russian wife
Svetlana were coming especially to see my Father and I had invited them for
lunch.  There was virtually no food in
the house so Eladio had to go and do the shopping.  Meanwhile I was to pick them up from the
train station on my way back from the office as they would never have found our
house nor do they have a sat nav in their car. 
Well believe it or not, I got lost picking them up as there were
horrific road works and no signs to indicate the way.  Finally I found my way again and eventually
picked them up and brought them home for lunch made by Olga.  Thank God for Olga is all I can say, and not
only for making the food and trying to keep the house clean but for how she
takes care of my Father and all with a constant smile on her face and great
enthusiasm.  We are very lucky to have
her.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>Sasha and Svetlana’s visit was a Russian tonic
for my Father or at least I think that is the best way to describe it.  I hadn’t seen them since my Aunty Masha’s
funeral in October 2008.  Sasha who lives
most of the year in Calpe on the Spanish Costa Blanca is my closest remaining
family on my Mother’s side together with my cousins Zuka (Sophie – daughter of
Kolya) who lives in between England and France and Andrei (son of my Mother’s
eldest brother Sasha) who lives in Canada.

<span>Life was slowly going back to normal and the
girls that night had a fancy dress party, one week ahead of Halloween.  It was actually their friend, Elena’s
birthday.  Below you can see them
together with their cousin Paula and her boyfriend Pedro.  Suzy was dressed as an explorer and was even
equipped with a butterfly net and Oli was dressed as the mascot for the 1982
Spanish world cup (funny choice eh?). The girls love dressing up and the
tradition comes from their school, St. Michael's.  I was never any good as a Mother helping them
to do so and dreaded Halloween every year. 
In fact it is a celebration that means nothing to me, a pure American
pagan festival and another product of globalization.  I would prefer to see Bonfire Night also
called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_Night">Guy Fawkes Night</a>, after the name of the main plotter who tried to burn
down the Houses of Parliament in England in 1605.  I
loved celebrating it with my family and friends in England on 5<sup>th</sup>
November when I was a child with fireworks, home-made toffee and bonfires which
culminated with the burning of effigies of Guy Fawkes and cannot forget this
rhyme: “Remember, remember, the 5<sup>th</sup> of November, gunpowder, treason
and plot.  I see no reason why gunpowder,
treason should ever be forgot”. Unfortunately I forgot to bring up my children
to celebrate this tradition so, of course, Halloween has taken over, at least
for them but not for me.</span></div>

<span>The next day we were to receive more visitors.  Adele and Bernard were coming from France
where they live in Orleans to stay with us for a week and we were going with them for a night
to Córdoba and Granada to show them the Mezquita and Jewish Quarter in the
former and of course the Alhambra in the latter.  Adele was one of my closest friends at
Nottingham University and Bernard is her psychiatrist second husband who
doubles up as an excellent painter in his spare time.  We have been meeting up recently once or
twice a year, often with Sandie and Jeffer and it was great to host them
again.  It was a pity Sandie couldn’t
come but let’s hope she can make it next time. We have a lot in common with
them, our ages, our likes and dislikes and probably too, similar temperaments,
but most of all we share a love of all things beautiful and tasting good; i.e.
culture and good food and wine.</span></div>

<span>We spent a quiet weekend with them at home, our
only excursions being to the local shopping centre where we all bought new
clothes, mainly from Massimo Dutti, Zara’s up market brand, and out to dinner
on Sunday night.  We went to the nearby
<a href="http://www.debrasaypuchero.com/">De Brasa y Puchero</a> where we introduced Adele and Bernard to “salmorejo”, the
thick gazpacho that comes from Córdoba and which they would soon be tasting in
the Andalusian town the following week. 
On Sunday we had the last barbecue of the season in their honour.  It was a little cold so we had to dress
Grandpa up in blankets and Bernard’s elegant hat in his wheel chair.  In any case it was a lovely family occasion,
despite the shower of rain during the dessert when we had to rush indoors.  Of course we also went for walks with the
dogs which we all enjoyed and found extremely necessary to work off the
excess food we were eating.  When you
have friends like Bernard and Adele to stay you always linger over meals,
drinking coffee, eating chocolates and serving after dinner drinks like the wonderful port
they brought for Grandpa and which we all enjoyed.</span></div>

<span>Both of
us have been to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B3rdoba,_Andalusia">Córdoba</a> and Granada on numerous occasions but were happy to
host our friends from France in two of our favourite locations in Spain.  I first fell in love with Córdoba on a visit
there when I was studying Spanish at Nottingham University and that was over 30
years ago.  When I say Córdoba I refer to
the old part, to the Jewish and Arab quarters, to the lovely white and narrow
streets and to the magnificent cathedral mosque.  In its heyday, in the 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup>
centuries Córdoba, which became the capital of one of the Islamic Caliphates,
was the most populated city in the world. 
Since I first fell in love with its romantic unspoiled whitewashed
houses, beautiful hidden patios and winding flowered streets, it has become
more of a tourist trap and is now more populated with American and Japanese
tourists, who, I hate to say, do not add to the magic of the place.  It is best therefore to explore the orange
tree lined streets at night.  And there
is no better way to do so than by a horse carriage driven by one of the local
gypsy drivers.  </span></div>

<span>We stayed at the <a href="http://h-rez.com/a309177/index_es.html?lbl=ggl-es">Hospedería El Churrasco</a> in the
heart of the Jewish Quarter.  It seemed
to be the most popular choice on Trip Advisor for couples of our age.  Getting to the car park via the narrow little
streets was something of a challenge. The outside was lovely but I was not so
keen on the décor of the rooms which was far too kitsch for Córdoba.  However, we were very comfortable there. Later
we heard that the King of Spain had also slept there but it turned out he had only
had a siesta.  In any case, this piece of
knowledge added to the mystique of staying in the Hospedería.</span></div>

in Spain as the Catholic Kings and famous for expelling the Moors and then the
Jews from Spain in 1492.  They are
equally well known for forming the infamous Spanish Inquisition but also for
giving Christopher Columbus their blessing for his first voyage to the
Americas.  From its towers you have
magnificent views of the Mezquita.  What
I liked best however were its gardens, very Moorish in their design and which
reminded me of Generalife in the Alhambra.

small one is in the old Jewish quarter of Córdoba.  Next to the synagogue, there was, hidden
away, the magnificent statue of the Spanish Jewish philosopher and physician,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides">Maimonedes</a> who was born in Córdoba in 1135. 
I well remember climbing up his statue on my first visit to Córdoba when
I was barely 20 to have my photo taken. 
A huge group of Japanese tourists had just arrived, when I was about to
have my photo taken some 30 odd years later but I didn’t care, I needed to take
that photo again and remember my youth. 
Lovely to see you again gentle and clever Maimonedes, sorry for making
you wait Japanese tourists.  I learned
that day from a young student from Córdoda that rubbing Maimonedes foot was
supposed to bring luck.  Just in case he
was right, I did as he said, after which I had all the Japanese tourists doing the
same.</span></div>

We were given a table in the lemon tree patio dining room and here Eladio
feasted on his favourite food, oxtail.  I
had excellent gazpacho, not quite being able to face another bowl of the

<span>After lunch, we packed our car and left through
the winding streets of Córdoba, to take the road to our next destination, Granada,
or rather the Alhambra.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhambra">The Alhambra</a> is Spain’s
most visited monument, a complex of palaces and fortresses set in wonderful
parkland overlooking the snow capped Sierra Nevada mountains and built in the
mid 14<sup>th</sup> century by the Moorish rulers of the Emirate of
Granada.  Alhambra literally means the
Red Castle or Fortress and there is still some red on the walls.  It is difficult to explain what is so
wonderful about it if you haven’t seen it. 
The Alhambra was extended over the years by the different rulers and it
seems to me that the buildings and gardens rival with each other in beauty,
with a constant theme, that of paradise on earth.  I remember from our last visit our guide
telling us that it was the best conserved medieval Moorish architecture in the
world.  No wonder it is so famous and so
many people come to visit it.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>We arrived again at dusk and checked into the
<a href="http://www.parador.es/en/parador-de-granada">Parador</a>, a XVth century convent set in the grounds of the Alhambra and which
looked very promising.  The building is
amazing; this is where Queen Isabella 1<sup>st</sup> was buried for a
time.  However the bland and modern décor
of the bedrooms and communal lounges and dining were a complete
disappointment.  I, at least, had
expected décor in accordance with the type of building in question.  The price too was very hefty.  We were comfortable enough and the food was
fine, but I was very disappointed to be staying in a room which was very
standard and did not make you think you were sleeping in the Alhambra.  </span></div>

<span>It was nearly sun set when we arrived and we
didn’t want our friends to miss the view of the Alhambra from the famous
<a href="//draft.blogger.com/%20http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g187441-d240258-r119525385-Mirador_de_San_Nicolas-Granada_Granada_Province_Andalucia.html">Mirador de San Nicolás</a> in the Arab Quarter, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albayz%C3%ADn">Albayacín</a>.  They were not disappointed and here I think
we got one of the best photos of our trip, the one illustrating this post.  The view is spectacular and everyday at this

<span>Later we tried to get into the Mosque of
Granada, next to the Mirador and I nearly got into a fight with the local
attendant.  He wouldn’t let us in, even
though the gates were open. I suspect he was Muslim and it was time for prayers
and we were not welcome.  Thus we
wandered down the steep streets of the Alybaycín area and into Sacramonte, the
area where gypsies live in caves and dance flamenco for tourists.  Unfortunately it was too early for any of
that and we decided to come back later, which of course, after our copious
dinner at the Parador we didn’t.  Eladio
and I walked back up the hill to the Parador in order to get a bit more
exercise and work up an appetite for dinner.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>The next day we were up early, well Adele and
Bernard, nearly slept in, and checked out in time to enter the Alhambra with
our 10 o’clock tickets.  If you want to
visit the Alhambra you have to buy tickets weeks in advance.  You can also buy them through the Parador a
few days before.  Unfortunately that day
it was raining and we were to visit the wonderful Unesco Heritage site using
our umbrellas most of the time.  The last
time we were here was with my Father in March 2008.  I think I have been 4 or 5 times but each
time is like the first visit, I am equally bowled over and can never remember everything
between visits.  What I will always
remember though is the Lion’s court with the lions’ fountain, something I only
ever saw intact on my first visit in 1980. 
Unfortunately it has been under renovation ever since.  In its place, perhaps the most well known
palace or part of the Alhambra is the Patio de Arrayanes.   </span></div>

top of the hill of the town that we wanted to show to our friends.  They were not disappointed, although it
rained throughout our time there and we were nearly blown off the cliff.  The décor inside was absolutely in accord
with the architecture of the wonderful Parador Castle of Santa Catalina.  The meal was delicious too and so filling we
had to ask for a doggy bag.</span></div>

dinner.  We were joined by the girls and it was another wonderful family affair at home, this time prepared by dear Olga who had made home- made vegetable soup and Spanish potato omelette for our arrival.It was good to see my Father
again and to hear that Manolo, his Russian pupil and “father” of Elsa had been
to visit him that afternoon for two hours. 
He had given him to read, Tales of the Alhambra by Washingon Irving but
in Russian.  Fancy.</span></div>

<span>Friday was Adele and Bernard’s last day.  I had to work and Eladio had to do the
shopping, so they went into Madrid to spend the day, their first stop being the
Museum of Modern Art, Reina Sofia where the star exhibit is the Guernica
painting by Pablo Picasso.  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span>On Saturday, their last day, we took them shopping
again, to Centro Oeste in Majadahonda, as they wanted to revisit Massimo Dutti and Oysho (both Zara owned). 
Eladio and I ended up doing our bit of shopping, with new shoes from Sebago for
Eladio and a lovely long short sleeved imitation fur waistcoat, a white winter
coat and black jacket from Zara.  It was
my lucky day!  Later, we went for an “aperitivo”,
a drink and tapa before lunch, nearby at a place called La Gitana.  The weather was so warm and sunny that of
course we sat outside.  Instead of the montilla
sherry we had white wine from Rueda, a discovery for Adele. And here I am
toasting them goodbye and wishing them a safe journey home.</span></div>

and Olga had made oxtail stew using the Simone Ortega cookery book recipe which is
how we always eat it at home.  And
then there was just time for a short siesta before I had to drive them to the
airport to catch their plane to Paris which was leaving at 20.30h and where they wanted to have ample time for even more shopping, this time duty free.  It was the end of a wonderful week of fun and
culture and good food together, as well as marvelous conversations and
company.  We haven’t fixed a date for our
next encounter but I hope it will be soon. 
We may well visit them in Orleans, the four of us and from there see
Paris.  Who knows?  One thing I do know is that we are now firm
friends and will be repeating these encounters as often as we can.  Goodbye Adele and Bernard, it was a pleasure

Here is just one picture of her outside the medieval castle.  One day Eladio and I will have to go there
too as it looks just like our kind of place. 
Maybe Adele and Bernard might join us.</span></div>

<span>On Sunday we were alone for lunch, so I decided
to make a dish Eladio forever craves and one he ate countless amount of times
at the seminary school when he was a child. 
I made red beans in red wine, again from the Simone Ortega cookery book
(1080 recipes) and here is the result. 
We have now been eating them for three days running but thankfully they
are finished now.  I am sure Adele and
Bernard would have loved them as they did the lentil soup I made for their
arrival and the oxtail stew Olga made on their departure. 
It’s also nice to see how Grandpa’s appetite is back and how he is
definitely on the mend since being discharged from the hospital just over 10
days ago now.</span></div>

<span>And on that note my friends, this bumper
edition of my blog comes to an end. 
Today is 1<sup>st</sup> November and a holiday so the week will be short
and there won’t be much to tell you next Sunday, certainly not as much as in
this edition.</span></div>
