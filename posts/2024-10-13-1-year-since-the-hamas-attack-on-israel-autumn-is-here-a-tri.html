Recently someone posted a meme I thought was very fitting of what my life is like and I suppose most people's lives. I used to think I was a very lucky person and I am in many ways but I have had a lot of downs in the last few years. So I wanted to share it with you.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFMvrdCTwh4YyRD1pN4iqc3Kn9r7UcG7G0amxacahqqreGwUxQMGJZPcTBTTyNfiRwo7NVJalxe91-aaJWqw7RN1TVU0NrhkoguUqTqMHd8weFwFIZWF25bmH4geONm36yVdZYWZaWBFsCppPBoU6sNWvfVegI0BiZB8WtR5zOcr5KvW9ZAPPbsw/s585/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-10-08%20at%2018.38.09_3d5cceee.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFMvrdCTwh4YyRD1pN4iqc3Kn9r7UcG7G0amxacahqqreGwUxQMGJZPcTBTTyNfiRwo7NVJalxe91-aaJWqw7RN1TVU0NrhkoguUqTqMHd8weFwFIZWF25bmH4geONm36yVdZYWZaWBFsCppPBoU6sNWvfVegI0BiZB8WtR5zOcr5KvW9ZAPPbsw/s320/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-10-08%20at%2018.38.09_3d5cceee.jpg" width="283"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>So true</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><p>It is courtesy of my cousin Andrei's wife, Debby who lives in Florida so imagine her week enduring Hurriane Milton. My friend Sandra who I often refer to in this blog says this is life but it's not always like this. </p><p><b>Last Sunday</b> at least was a quiet day. Suzy had spent most of the weekend with Olivia and the kids and their friend Laura and her baby. She had enjoyed it but I think it was all a bit too much for her. After all she has been living like a hermit and too much socialising had taken its toll. <br></br></p><p>Some things pass and others don't, such as the situation in the Middle East. Ever since I was a child I have been aware of tensions in Israel and Palestine. It has been in the news during all my lifetime and even more so when one year ago on <b>Monday</b>, 7th October, Hamas attacked Israel and murdered and kidnapped many, some of whom were returned, some died and others are still being held hostage. Israel retaliated and we all know how Gaza has suffered but then their allies, Iran and Hezbollah in the Lebanon got involved and the war is expanding regionally. Israel boasts it has killed many of the leaders but where one dies, another emerges. I do not see an end to this war or even a solution. So no, it never f***ing ends does it?</p><p>Our lives continued quietly. We went on our walk and enjoyed Suzy's company for lunch. </p><p><b>Tuesday</b> was busier. I had lots to do; fill the tank of my Mini, get a prescription for more sleeping tablets and then a trip to my hairdresser, Conchi, who does my hair for a paltry 18 euros. Suzy and I had lunch alone as Eladio had invited his friends Roberto and Juanjo to a belated 80th birthday lunch. I spent time with <br></br>Amanda during our Monday afternoon skype call which I always look forward to. New guests were coming from Ecuador and Suzy had to move to our Annexe which we had spruced up but none of us slept well. Thankfully the guests had preferred to use one room instead of two so after that Suzy had her own space.</p><p>She would have had it anyway as on <b>Wednesday</b> we had decided to drive to Vitoria which is about 4h north of Madrid on the A1 towards Bilbao, San Sebastian and France. We weren't going for the weather as it was foul. Autumn really came this week with lots of rain and wind but nothing compared to Hurricane Milton. But it does mean our Indian summer is officially over. We were going to see a showroom of wooden cabin homes imported from Holland by a company called <a href="https://www.hobycasa.com/">Hobycasa</a>. They seem to have the biggest range of log cabins on offer. The only thing is they don't' offer them turnkey which means we need a contractor for all the rest (electricity, plumbing, etc) but I have found two. If we really were going to buy a log cabin we had to see them for real rather than just on internet. I booked a night at the Parador de Argomaniz, about 11km from the centre of Vitoria. I had been years ago during some cycling race with my dear friend Fátima and was keen to go again. </p><p>We left home at 9.15, aiming to arrive at the Parador for lunch at around 14.00, so plenty of time I thought. However, some other thing came to pass to thwart our plans. One of the back tyres of the Volvo literally burst on the AI, about 85km from the Parador. It was raining and foggy so I think we never saw what caused it but it was possibly gravel.  Luckily, there was a service station just off the hard shoulder so we could stop somewhere safe rather than on the hard shoulder on the motorway. This is what the tyre looked like; ravaged.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjz0WdrR3i1JTNWZ1LCXg21SLnSyi8uapl32xEX5gmoi2cAal8HhzeRGfdm-nhVVp0ERDO0SEkaWILl3iH2NCewuL22V2F6Tk7flYzdB9h1akH8IqdaR4hu7OoSh2Jl6b55D6l6tmPdgnvUJrbz46HGp5B2X0hr6CPZ5djAoCkA5XYpS0VhGFMHjg/s1600/tyre.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjz0WdrR3i1JTNWZ1LCXg21SLnSyi8uapl32xEX5gmoi2cAal8HhzeRGfdm-nhVVp0ERDO0SEkaWILl3iH2NCewuL22V2F6Tk7flYzdB9h1akH8IqdaR4hu7OoSh2Jl6b55D6l6tmPdgnvUJrbz46HGp5B2X0hr6CPZ5djAoCkA5XYpS0VhGFMHjg/w400-h180/tyre.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The burst tyre on our way to Vitoria on Wednesday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We immediately rang our insurance company who promised to send someone within 45 minutes. The man actually came 1.5h later. Here he is changing the tyre in infernal weather by the way.  I don't remember what time he finished but  it was late and we had missed our lunch. <table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjzXa4GvLFUVPXsSS3R7ZwL4_i26pKrnzKWKZ7g0qK3bNCzWoalc_vF7DFOWsg4wwzzDgml0KBIOPJrzhyncff_dHEA4FmiH76MdEC79Ty6FH6xBx5HS2cwe32U_qo5iAcrk8UoHMH5Rx-Ml_19q9V_VQRCJe1YySvjm-rpdIw8g6XiyqsAswfgqQ/s1600/car%20with%20men.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjzXa4GvLFUVPXsSS3R7ZwL4_i26pKrnzKWKZ7g0qK3bNCzWoalc_vF7DFOWsg4wwzzDgml0KBIOPJrzhyncff_dHEA4FmiH76MdEC79Ty6FH6xBx5HS2cwe32U_qo5iAcrk8UoHMH5Rx-Ml_19q9V_VQRCJe1YySvjm-rpdIw8g6XiyqsAswfgqQ/w400-h180/car%20with%20men.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Changing the tyre on the way to Vitoria</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>We were starving too. We could only drive at a maximum speed of 80kmh with the spare tyre and arrived tired and hungry at the Parador. They had no food for us either as the kitchen was closed and the cafeteria didn't even have sandwiches. Thus we had to drive to the nearest supermarket to get food to make a sandwich which we had in our hotel room at 5.30 pm, nearly English tea time, hahaha. The village we headed for was called "Alegria" (happiness) but the drive was not happy as there was a huge rain shower and I got soaked going into the Eroski supermarket. We later ate sandwiches in our room. </div><div><div><br></br></div><div>But we were safe and nothing major had happened, just sh** that happens and you have to deal with until the next thing comes. We then had to postpone our visit to the showroom and also find a garage to get a new tyre. There was no rest for the wicked that day.<br></br><div><br></br></div><div>But we had our reward that night by having dinner at the Parador, not that we were particularly hungry btw. I noticed many of the guests resembled ourselves, retired couples, and many from outside Spain. I think the Paradors in Spain are very popular with people like us. We certainly like them. </div></div></div><div><br></br></div><div>Despite a beautifully comfortable bed I didn't sleep well - I have had a horrible spate of sleepless nights and I am exhausted. Hopefully, that will pass too. But I perked up at breakfast on <b>Thursday</b> morning at the Parador. It was magnificent with anything you could imagine you might like for breakfast and to suit all tastes. I especially liked the churros. </div><div><br></br></div><div>By 9.30 we had checked out and were on our way to Vitoria to get the tyre changed at Neumáticos Arriaga. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj81JS5MTmSE7_C4gqi0vgaFGVDJdPr2VyWpoMZT2igK5bBP_SBZMIce4S9jPnvo2ZNOwdBiaDaf7DgGx_uiqjAkxzI-Qn0sNXAPatWKLL0oGslFpDryF2vjSgqNq1b6KavLJkBUsyXSAm94xTDUu3toR6N_j4ovQWHsVewrTFj3O6hm7a1m7eRtw/s1600/eladio%20parador%20thursday.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj81JS5MTmSE7_C4gqi0vgaFGVDJdPr2VyWpoMZT2igK5bBP_SBZMIce4S9jPnvo2ZNOwdBiaDaf7DgGx_uiqjAkxzI-Qn0sNXAPatWKLL0oGslFpDryF2vjSgqNq1b6KavLJkBUsyXSAm94xTDUu3toR6N_j4ovQWHsVewrTFj3O6hm7a1m7eRtw/w213-h400/eladio%20parador%20thursday.jpg" width="213"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Leaving the Parador</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br></br></div><div>We left the car there to pick it up later and then took a taxi to Hobycasa. We had left the car in very good hands. In the end, as you probably know, when you need to change one tyre, you have to change the other one too:(. There we were met by Nuria, an expert in wooden houses. They had many on show but not all of their 300 or so models. But we got the feel of the place, got to meet the company who imports the flat packed wooden houses from Holland and it felt good. We have searched long and wide and I think Hobycasa is where we are going to buy our little house. We chose the Cádiz model which is much bigger than what we initially wanted - 35m2 with a lounge and kitchen area, a bathroom and two small bedrooms. Here are some photos.</div><div><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgmey6DfkgWsG92ZTQOWhKbUKn40Jpkoqu6Ub0Z9bmsRBNxpetTO9QVmIlLEbmLGLT-WcDBPfZYSb1rH8qvWUT0KvCaqBZKENrDI7cY5cbaBav5sS4cU9Kkc8K6DDQQwz0wky_ben6NYSI4vXYmz93Cr2S-s23O5VuDmPFGWrU4-JlPJrVx6zhvnA/s2000/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-10-10%20at%2012.37.09_a3fc713b.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="188" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgmey6DfkgWsG92ZTQOWhKbUKn40Jpkoqu6Ub0Z9bmsRBNxpetTO9QVmIlLEbmLGLT-WcDBPfZYSb1rH8qvWUT0KvCaqBZKENrDI7cY5cbaBav5sS4cU9Kkc8K6DDQQwz0wky_ben6NYSI4vXYmz93Cr2S-s23O5VuDmPFGWrU4-JlPJrVx6zhvnA/w400-h188/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-10-10%20at%2012.37.09_a3fc713b.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXjypDjOU9wjmHQ4uUgGS-itk2hA02AyFGT34lsv7hVdWPSCQ3Xa3ejdlmsXQEK9rPFnGeu367pDeMJpPQwVd1TNFSJC7IZC5UywWt0c7GJV1NWJbXWrsAf_Om5SAKMGLkM67qn_7cpPHQ8UPqh5BbLcX_TrynFkerlJZUZ1TaOxnGluqIvEZ_Gw/s1600/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-10-10%20at%2012.37.17_7d2d29be.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXjypDjOU9wjmHQ4uUgGS-itk2hA02AyFGT34lsv7hVdWPSCQ3Xa3ejdlmsXQEK9rPFnGeu367pDeMJpPQwVd1TNFSJC7IZC5UywWt0c7GJV1NWJbXWrsAf_Om5SAKMGLkM67qn_7cpPHQ8UPqh5BbLcX_TrynFkerlJZUZ1TaOxnGluqIvEZ_Gw/w400-h225/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-10-10%20at%2012.37.17_7d2d29be.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></br></div><br></br><div>And this is the layout inside.</div><div><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigoyCevt_5C3_nAOVpILLF5llTbgts2lc5rUajzr0FaV9SW4QYU3uzKkLgaQiJYCdEckkjGMJhQQusEMcXNGTFUmpgE_bJ7QNs9m2QR3-B3J3hHNszYZG0ccIoZnqptyK_KVQxQ0XMnh7xmSHK0HSjrddtB_BU9Cu4vu_XPbrWqghX1tb-_t49Iw/s1024/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-10-10%20at%2012.37.03_b5335c7b.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="266" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEigoyCevt_5C3_nAOVpILLF5llTbgts2lc5rUajzr0FaV9SW4QYU3uzKkLgaQiJYCdEckkjGMJhQQusEMcXNGTFUmpgE_bJ7QNs9m2QR3-B3J3hHNszYZG0ccIoZnqptyK_KVQxQ0XMnh7xmSHK0HSjrddtB_BU9Cu4vu_XPbrWqghX1tb-_t49Iw/w400-h266/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-10-10%20at%2012.37.03_b5335c7b.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><div>And below is a glimpse of what it looks like inside. </div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKXhadKgyhebNEOOEG8HjXdeaJ98ShyphenhyphenhiS1UyYCJPhKUpKk1oRbs-XsHZDZZCwEJpojQ1DU_TPlhcrF8e0u4qvHCFkOXnHFgGGM-jXdD3Bn59dnPDrmtqXuIQgqI6QkhDUT2gQt-4bXEzQ03ycJ9Ehga98NGBZjALyMbQBQzJBsOKsbOCzjEv14g/s864/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-10-10%20at%2012.37.49_350a693a.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="375" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKXhadKgyhebNEOOEG8HjXdeaJ98ShyphenhyphenhiS1UyYCJPhKUpKk1oRbs-XsHZDZZCwEJpojQ1DU_TPlhcrF8e0u4qvHCFkOXnHFgGGM-jXdD3Bn59dnPDrmtqXuIQgqI6QkhDUT2gQt-4bXEzQ03ycJ9Ehga98NGBZjALyMbQBQzJBsOKsbOCzjEv14g/w400-h375/WhatsApp%20Image%202024-10-10%20at%2012.37.49_350a693a.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div>We would have placed an order there and then but first have to meet the contractor who will do everything else - plumbing, electricity, installation of the kitchen, bathroom, etc. He is coming here on Tuesday to discuss all we have to do. Then, of course there is the furniture and decoration; so quite a big project. But it is a project which, hopefully, will bring us a lot of joy and income too which is the main purpose. A friend said it could be our retirement place when we get too old to climb stairs. Well, who knows?<div><br></br></div><div>We left at 12.30 and were about to take a taxi to explore the centre of Vitoria, known as Spain's greenest city, but we got a call from the garage to say the car was ready so headed there instead.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Soon we were on the road home, the A1 and just one hour away from Burgos. Thus, the obvious choice for lunch was the Hotel Landa where we stayed recently to celebrate Eladio's birthday.  Once again we could not resist the roast suckling lamb.</div><div><br></br></div><div>We were home by 6.30 due to heavy commuter traffic but we were home and glad to be. We were greeted by Suzy, Tana and Pippa. Before even unpacking, we went outside to the back patio where we will eventually build the wooden house, to measure it. The house measures 7 metres long and 5 metres wide so takes up a lot of the patio which is already very big. But that is its place.</div><div><br></br></div><div>The big news that day was the announcement from legend Rafa Nadal that he is retiring from Tennis after the Davis Cup finals next month. What to say? He is 38 and has been plagued with injury and pain most of his more than 20 years of professional tennis but no one wants to see him go. He won 22 grand slams, just two short of Djokovic. Who knows how many more he would have won though if he didn't suffer from the rare degenerative condition called Mueller-Weiss syndrome. In 2004 he was told he had to quit tennis because of the syndrome. But he is a warrior and continued despite the chronic pain that affected the bones in his feet, He has given us so much joy, along with Federer and Djokovic. He has also been Spain's best ambassador ever. In France he is a legend too for winning 14 Roland Garros.

My Kindle which usually helps me to sleep had frozen but thankfully I was able to reboot it on<b> Friday </b>after googling how to. What would we have done without Google in the past?</div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Friday</b> was obviously shopping day as the cupboards were rather bare. It took us most of the morning. Once again we ate alone while Suzy went to have lunch with Oli - I love that they are having quality sister time.</div><div><br></br></div><div>I managed an hour's sleep after lunch which had me in better spirits and then I was out again, this time to my nail bar or salon. I don't like going to the hairdresser but I enjoy having my nails done. I had what they call a Russian manicure which uses a drill to get rid of all hard skin. That was my hour of indulgence this week.</div><div><br></br></div><div>And then <b>Saturday</b> was here and I had a great day and a break from routine. My school friend Geraldine from St. Josephs' College Bradford, who I have known since we were 11, was stopping over in Madrid for two nights on her way from Washington to her house near Marbella. It was a wonderful chance to see her and for her to see a bit of Madrid as, although she has travelled extensively, she had never been to Madrid. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We met in Plaza España on one of the worst days ever to visit Madrid. It was raining heavily for most of the morning and it was Spain's National Day which is a holiday to celebrate Christopher Colombus' discovery of America in 1492. It is also the Armed Forces Day with a huge parade attended by the Royal family which also means traffic chaos. But I took the metro and Geraldine walked from Atocha. We headed to the <a href="https://www.riu360rooftopbar.com/">rooftop bar of Hotel Rui</a>  but it was not the best day to see the great views from the top owing to the heavy rain. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgoIkwHjPe7q5ZzOMclWQOLU_BQsLfzzwS0UBjY5-b4NaLBl-DKFkAK0SUzNnb06slefLgMOhC8seDUQzVz3t4ZnUPv0yhy9oap6GZlvz7B0VYzajS0OXYBEYAUW-rw7kayp_zAMrRT_ZaptASgK2L34aB5eKWxmUMLbguKXpC9DFdfB3TKLD3BYA/s1600/IMG-20241012-WA0019.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgoIkwHjPe7q5ZzOMclWQOLU_BQsLfzzwS0UBjY5-b4NaLBl-DKFkAK0SUzNnb06slefLgMOhC8seDUQzVz3t4ZnUPv0yhy9oap6GZlvz7B0VYzajS0OXYBEYAUW-rw7kayp_zAMrRT_ZaptASgK2L34aB5eKWxmUMLbguKXpC9DFdfB3TKLD3BYA/w300-h400/IMG-20241012-WA0019.jpg" width="300"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The rooftop bar in the rain</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Despite the rain it was great to be together. I hadn't seen Geraldine since she held a garden party for us in her home in Yorkshire when we were there in May 2022 for my father's funeral. We had a good catch up over a capuccino and tried to decide what to do escape the rain. I very stupidly looked for tickets to see the Royal Palace but of course it was closed for the King's reception after the parades. There were no tickets available for the Prado either but we did find tickets to see a lesser known but magnificent palace, The Palacio de Liria which belongs to the house of the Duke of Alba, Spain's most noble family.<div><br></br></div><div>When there was a slight in the rain, we ventured out and walked up the Gran Via teeming with people, towards Callao and along Spain's most commercial street, Preciados, until we got to the very heart of the city the Puerta del Sol. As Madrid is in the very centre of the country, roads are measured from this square and people queue up to take a photo of the exact spot called "Kilómetro 0" We did too.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhFof93egp3DxCWR1AAYJwlpEVV8e7_aeQJuB97hSaz8m30YmHlfBcdwngW90XPQ3YFuqeOS5V0Ie-wvLROj79B3jA36RaQ7TPrW_2yh48C0Nbqofyfy2nce37QJFd2FtaZYyqnOr5QUPOyWbPA8I6JeO62RrTwxDCTZ_AWRQw456IKxarNpKb6YA/s2809/20241012_121626.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhFof93egp3DxCWR1AAYJwlpEVV8e7_aeQJuB97hSaz8m30YmHlfBcdwngW90XPQ3YFuqeOS5V0Ie-wvLROj79B3jA36RaQ7TPrW_2yh48C0Nbqofyfy2nce37QJFd2FtaZYyqnOr5QUPOyWbPA8I6JeO62RrTwxDCTZ_AWRQw456IKxarNpKb6YA/w259-h400/20241012_121626.jpg" width="259"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Kilometre Zero with Geraldine yesterday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Being the local, I guided my friend to the Plaza Mayor and took her to its most famous entrance, "Cuchilleros" and showed her <a href="https://botin.es/en/home/">Botin</a>, the oldest restaurant in the world, the building of which was started in around 1590. It was a pity we couldn't get a table there but you have to book weeks in advance. I had found it difficult to get a table for us but finally found one at <a href="https://www.elparaguas.com/">El Paraguas </a>(the umbrella!). It's in Madrid's chic district of Salamanca so we took the metro from Opera to the Retiro park and then found our way there. It was so lovely to be somewhere so civilised and where you know anything you order will be of excellent quality. For the record we had battered prawns, artichokes and croquettes. Here we are sitting down and about to enjoy a lovely Spanish meal at a chic restaurant, a far cry from going to the Kashmir in Bradford for lunch when we were at school hahaha. <table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0IWWMBp5tY5TVXCfJyfQAWPohBCHv8owDpmD7Nu4YVndI9iLN19d0S_6Cb2Eljrhbr8wW6byX3IiO9ueqDjRCiH7DZy3bgkXc5rEgo5A5T8nBYU_s5tR5MFgnsGwj5wzluHAgJA6W749xwv7dmfEgmw1ZMhcWD9boRmMOCwSJQy2a-f_DGuCTVg/s1600/IMG-20241012-WA0030.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh0IWWMBp5tY5TVXCfJyfQAWPohBCHv8owDpmD7Nu4YVndI9iLN19d0S_6Cb2Eljrhbr8wW6byX3IiO9ueqDjRCiH7DZy3bgkXc5rEgo5A5T8nBYU_s5tR5MFgnsGwj5wzluHAgJA6W749xwv7dmfEgmw1ZMhcWD9boRmMOCwSJQy2a-f_DGuCTVg/w400-h300/IMG-20241012-WA0030.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Lunch with Geraldine at El Paraguas yesterday</td></tr></tbody></table>I then took my friend to another favourite place in Madrid, the beautiful Balbisiana cafe where she had Earl Grey and I had a decaf. We also tired one of their delicious homemade truffles.<div><br></br></div><div>Our tickets for the Liria Palace were for 15.45, so at about 3pm we got a taxi and were dropped off by the Royal Palace so my friend could see it. There were crowds outside waiting to see government figures and the King but we were not for waiting. We had to rush to the other palace, got there a little late but on time to see it. I had always heard this palace was stunning. It is owned by the Albas, who count among their descendants Mary Queen of Scots, the House of FitzJames and the first Duke of Berwick. Their lineage is rather complicated but did you know that the former Duchess of Alba had more titles than the Queen of England and that they were friends? The Liria Palace is their Madrid residence and is full of paintings by famous painters  - what a collection.

The elder son, Cayetano told her that to see his mother he had to go through her secretary. She also told me the kids were generally left to their own devices while at the Club. Funny eh?</div><div><br></br></div><div>Our day in Madrid did not end there. It had stopped raining after lunch so we decided to walk from the Palace to the Retiro park - quite a walk. We stopped at the Cibeles square where the Correos building and the town hall are. It is one of Madrid's most iconic buildings. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Our last picture of the day was by the lake and it is the one I have chosen for this week's post. We then walked to the end and sat and had a aperol spritz sitting by the lake and chatting until it got late. We parted ways after a wet but wonderful day together, at the end of which we had walked more than 20 thousand steps! When I got home my legs were aching. I joined Eladio for a quick bite for supper and soon we were in bed. He watched Spain beat Denmark in a football match while I turned on my iPad to watch more of The Resident on Netflix which I am quite addicted to.</div><div><br></br></div><div>I was up today, <b>Sunday</b>, at around 6.50 after having slept 7.15 hours which is a lot for me. Today will be a sunny day and the temperature will reach 25ºc. If only it had been like that yesterday then my friend would have seen Madrid in a better light. Even so, we had a great day together. It was fun and a super break from routine for me. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Now my friends I have come to the end of the tales of this week. Let me wish you a happy Sunday and say thanks to you for reading my blog. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Cheers till next week,</div><div><br></br></div><div>Masha<br></br><div><br></br></div><div><br></br><div><br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div><div><br></br></div></div></div></div>
