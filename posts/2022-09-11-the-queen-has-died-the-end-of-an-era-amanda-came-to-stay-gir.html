So lucky to get up there with good weather. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Good morning everyone. What can I say? The Queen has died and I am devastated as so many people are. I just didn't expect it as I'm sure you didn't either. Just like JFK or the 11th of September (it is actually 11th September today) we will all remember where we were and what we were doing when we heard of her death. Thus 8th September will become a date I shall never forget. She has been on the throne for 70 years and a constant, comforting presence in our lives. If her family made trouble, she never did, never putting a foot wrong, giving all of herself to duty and earned the  respect of even the dire hard republicans. It's not that I am a huge fan of the monarchy, I am a huge fan of Elizabeth II and to see her go is to live through the end of an era. It's as if with her passing something has been taken away from us and from our childhood. She was an amazing Queen but she was also a mother and grandmother and became in a way the Grandmother of the nation, just as her mother, the Queen Mother, Queen Victoria did, but I do think she is probably the most loved monarch in the history of the country.  She was too a family woman and it's nice to see her family rally round. But of course her death produces huge change in England. Charles becomes King Charles III, William becomes the Prince of Wales and most striking Charles' wife Camila  becomes Queen Consort meaning she also will be crowned when the Coronation takes place.  Everything I have to write about my week, now pales in comparison. Below you can read about my week which was all about   friendship, which I am sure Her late Majesty would approve of. </p><p>This week has been very different to last week. Last week was all about family time with the stress of having our delightful but tiring grandchildren here the whole time and the visit of Pernille, our dearest Danish au-pair. This week has been all about my time with my dearest and oldest friend, Amanda, in dire need of a break herself, who arrived last Sunday and was coming  for a luxurious 10 days  of free time with me. We have been friends since the age of 11 when we met at St. Joseph's Catholic Grammar School in Bradford, West Yorkshire, many moons ago. I love that our friendship never dwindles. Throughout the pandemic we spoke weekly on Skype and still do but it's so much nicer to be together in person.</p><p>While she was preparing to leave, we were already saying goodbye to dear Pernille after a wonderful, short but sweet visit. There were tears in her eyes when she got into the taxi. I begged her not to leave it another 5 years until we see each other again. I hope we can keep that promise.</p><p>Eladio and I managed a morning walk for the first time in days. It was somewhat interrupted by an amateur cycling race but we didn't care as we needed the exercise. Oli and the kids were at home when we arrived, Suzy was packing to go and stay with friends and I packed too for my stay in Asturias with Amanda. Lunch was leftovers and there were plenty. There was plenty of cake left too which was a good thing as dear baby Juliet's 1st birthday was actually last Sunday 4th September. Here is a photo of the cake moment which Elliot had missed the day before. They both loved the candle but neither of them ate any cake, hahahahaha.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5j5J4BfZgHm7GkXYOHnKzNQ3tTkK2vkk5kMQ8kHlPCirOl4EwEYxotZwUxgFMrpGybw-xzYg64uGGEdsGIyw4lCChGRkunCwPFWRhhKpiWPuctuiPfmY7VVyDWcG8mQ534KDywurFN0W1w-wQRkYG0dNwGRxJ35nYOcHLyu-F_VHfzKP_1yc/s4032/Kids%20and%20candle%20moment.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5j5J4BfZgHm7GkXYOHnKzNQ3tTkK2vkk5kMQ8kHlPCirOl4EwEYxotZwUxgFMrpGybw-xzYg64uGGEdsGIyw4lCChGRkunCwPFWRhhKpiWPuctuiPfmY7VVyDWcG8mQ534KDywurFN0W1w-wQRkYG0dNwGRxJ35nYOcHLyu-F_VHfzKP_1yc/w400-h180/Kids%20and%20candle%20moment.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Celebrating Juliet's 1st birthday again last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>I had a new guest arriving that afternoon - a young girl from Berlin (Tanja) and had hoped the girls and the kids would keep quiet and be tidy. My hopes were dashed as I rose from my siesta. Thankfully Suzy put all the toys away and got Elliot who was running round the house naked out of the way too. I was a bit ashamed to show Tanja the house with all the family round the pool. But I couldn't do anything. So up I went to our bedroom again to escape to my kindle. Thankfully when I came down everyone had gone and it was just us and the guests and Lucy of course.<div><br></br></div><div>I had some quiet time reading by the pool and messaging with Amanda who was already at London Heathrow. Her BA plane would by delayed by 1.5h which meant my plans for dinner together got skewed. In the end it was just Eladio and I for dinner but I kept some for my friend in case she was hungry which no doubt she would be. I left the house just before 9 pm and it wasn't until 11.30 pm that we were home!!! What a stress. I hate driving in the dark and hate driving to Terminal 4, that monster of a terminal at Madrid Barajas airport. I could hardly see the signs and think I took the wrong toll road there but I made it. The problem when you arrive at T4 is that the car park is miles away so everyone waits outside in their cars. You are only allowed to be there for a quick drop off and as I arrived there was a policeman shooing the cars away. Luckily he didn't see me but it had me worried until Amanda finally got out. Flying today is not what it was.</div><div><br></br></div><div>The drive back was easier and it was great to chat together in the car on the way home. The only problem then was my friend's big suitcase which I had to take up two flights of stairs as she had done her back in. Mine is not great but I managed.</div><div><br></br></div><div>I was up at 6.15 - far too early - on <b>Monday</b> morning. I couldn't get away early enough as I was so looking forward to our girly trip to Asturias. I think we left at around 10.45 and both of us felt as free as the wind with me at the wheel in my lovely now not so British Mini. We stopped for breakfast, then for a glass of wine in Rueda at the lovely Palacio de Bornos. We didn't have the plate of ham though as we had booked a table for lunch at La Cueva in Alar del Rey further away. We sat outside tasting the  Rueda wine made from the local "verdejo" grape and my friend agreed it is one of the best white wines in the world.  They didn't charge us for the glass when I bought 4 bottles of it to take with us - not all to be drunk in Asturias I assure you.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEip28LCg140LOr2r6-ZuqbYKOcORQcRZ6APFifX0aNTKhOMiPP3pgb_Z3jztEV9uD1aHQX5u1TUYK4if6JZWVpMgeC5CEbfaS7iEfaCkHCPEWjrzXrZCJbZiiyugtI4WLZZTDaLaIKG4sKmmYaj1nF-KxLzJ6gTMd89OYU7p9xicrQ_1lfxgxE/s4032/20220905_131009.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEip28LCg140LOr2r6-ZuqbYKOcORQcRZ6APFifX0aNTKhOMiPP3pgb_Z3jztEV9uD1aHQX5u1TUYK4if6JZWVpMgeC5CEbfaS7iEfaCkHCPEWjrzXrZCJbZiiyugtI4WLZZTDaLaIKG4sKmmYaj1nF-KxLzJ6gTMd89OYU7p9xicrQ_1lfxgxE/w400-h180/20220905_131009.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My friend enjoying a glass of wine in Rueda</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5Nf087xRDLtY7jksKsdluT0cPfYrMTAavH-qLNjM2ACsKcbJH6S6w0MA8r5YRN1R_YdbISmdwWXJRQdhWwUUvd-fL3R453zsJsVz3MQS5ntouxXtGLCMIQQpMjwiMLa7OxJ4a83J6MBt11bKFJiX4F8kAB2tBeSfc6QRhS_9NWC2l1f9Si3A/s1024/IMG-20220905-WA0003.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5Nf087xRDLtY7jksKsdluT0cPfYrMTAavH-qLNjM2ACsKcbJH6S6w0MA8r5YRN1R_YdbISmdwWXJRQdhWwUUvd-fL3R453zsJsVz3MQS5ntouxXtGLCMIQQpMjwiMLa7OxJ4a83J6MBt11bKFJiX4F8kAB2tBeSfc6QRhS_9NWC2l1f9Si3A/w300-h400/IMG-20220905-WA0003.jpg" width="300"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Happy as a sandboy - or shouldn't that be sandgirl hahaha</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>It was a beautiful day, sunny but with a breeze and the further north we went the greener and hillier it got. I have a feeling this area is a bit like Scotland but with better weather and higher mountains- about 27ºc that day. We arrived in our tiny village, parked as best as I could and then unloaded the car. My friend had done her back in so I had to carry all the loads the most difficult part being lugging up the century old stair case, our 2 massive suit cases. We had 4 rooms to choose from and in the end I went for "our room" the room with 2 big single beds. It felt strange to unpack without Eladio around. </div><div><p>Once we had settled in we sat outside on our terrace with another glass of Rueda until it got dark. It gets dark there now  at 8.45 which makes for a long sunny day. Dinner was a delicious creamy red lentil soup I had brought from home. Entertainment was beginning a film called Mr. Jones set in the early stages of the Cold War. Without subtitles and with a complicated plot I think I just lost it and fell asleep. We went to bed early and I actually only woke up once.</p><p>Tuesday dawned and I was up at 7 am - brilliant.  We enjoyed a leisurely breakfast and took as long as wanted to get ready. As we were leaving some stray kittens we had seen upon our arrival, were at our door. We fell in love with them, of course.  Later we would make friends and feed them. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1ks9q2bV6WuvWC14F4Lb2iF4bZiA8X3ZmyUmKD671mT4nZ3LPH3egjq8DDC8i-b7o1IAD8PugIkoMJGQUmpY31_ULANgFgjhIXUma5d9yroT7JQQKi0XxV5m8b6pBafs9Y7uFsNbTvB2HE6AXihnfUd6FhytFO5vRizxz-PG6I6__JplEnSg/s4032/1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1ks9q2bV6WuvWC14F4Lb2iF4bZiA8X3ZmyUmKD671mT4nZ3LPH3egjq8DDC8i-b7o1IAD8PugIkoMJGQUmpY31_ULANgFgjhIXUma5d9yroT7JQQKi0XxV5m8b6pBafs9Y7uFsNbTvB2HE6AXihnfUd6FhytFO5vRizxz-PG6I6__JplEnSg/w180-h400/1.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Amanda and the cats</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">As we were leaving we both admired the view of the nearby mountains from our street and house.

People say this coast is similar to Brittany but I doubt that French coast can boast such exotic vegetation.

I really love Llanes and so did Amanda. We parked by the Sablón beach and walked into the old town with its wonderful old buildings, many used in Spanish period dramas. I also had to show my friend my favourite gourmet shop, <a href="https://www.aramburu-tienda.es/">Aramburu</a>, There we bought food for meals in the evening and left our shopping to pick up later as we didn't want to carry it to the restaurant which was a far walk from the centre of town. For the record we bought Iberian ham (of course), some thick asparagus to have with mayonnaise, "pastel de cabracho" - a sort of fish pate- and some meat pie which looked delicious. </div><div><br></br></div><div>It was quite a walk to get to the restaurant where I had booked a table - <a href="https://miradordetoro.com/carta/">El Mirador de Toró</a> ,the one I had discovered in May when I came here with my other girl friends, Adele and Sandra. This restaurant is the best I have found so far, its salient point being its location over the Toró beach. The food is marvelous too and the restaurant full, mainly of well to do Spaniards, many of them local. We both commented that the energy crisis, inflation and all the horrible crises going on only really affect people who are badly off. That is so true and so unfair. I felt privileged to be able to afford eating out every day in Asturias. My friend pointed out - to make me feel better - that I had earned it by working hard all my life; even now with my little holiday rental business. I suppose she is right. </div><div><br></br></div><div>For the record we both had seafood - I just adore it although I am not really keen on fish. As we left El Mirador de Toró, I had to have a photo of my friend by the Playa de Toró with its wonderful rock formations. <br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjD0Xi1KEgzAb7DVY5nUXjW6YVLHsgf28xhngN7cIZw58bSTdvFbyGSam3WZG6rqHaag_UkjuS-hekfSwBi_VUpE5m2UUQeDP6B-cwzWCQvX9ebIT-5zz6F1-195Fu22G56yYehLWpT0fwrJx-_Su00-Q9VlYp0oy86T1x4FShDNjc6bzLEdJE/s4032/7.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjD0Xi1KEgzAb7DVY5nUXjW6YVLHsgf28xhngN7cIZw58bSTdvFbyGSam3WZG6rqHaag_UkjuS-hekfSwBi_VUpE5m2UUQeDP6B-cwzWCQvX9ebIT-5zz6F1-195Fu22G56yYehLWpT0fwrJx-_Su00-Q9VlYp0oy86T1x4FShDNjc6bzLEdJE/w400-h180/7.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Amanda .

Am I pleased? I should be as we now have another woman Prime Minister and I think anything is better than Boris Johnson. However, there are many question marks as to how good she will be. Some say she is more ambitious than capable. Time will tell. For the moment I am unhappy with her cabinet post appointments. There are only 3 women damn her. She has put plenty of non white people in her inner circle which is neither here nor there for me but only 3 women!!! One of them is a lady called Thèrése  Coffey (notice the accents - love the surname)  the new Health Minister  who apparently loves a drink or two and is the heart and soul of the party  at Downing Street.  She is Truss' closest colleague. Not too bad right, except that her appearance is not exactly that of a role model for the job she has to do. I am not fat shaming her - how could I as I am fat myself? Coffey could have chosen any of the jobs going, including  three of the four great offices of state (PM, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Foreign Secretary or Home Secretary) but she went for Health. I suppose she thinks she can turn the page for the ailing NHS. I doubt it somehow. The only good news here is that we finally have a new PM, the Boris Johnson era is over, and, perhaps, just perhaps we can go forward. It will not be easy. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLVXA_OVwoqC4JHzBearnXMsyHheG2fxKn499p3-vyMJAUzQbNUi8gCiZUo2phEL0AzMqHLEoFzOwr_dB9JpFuLnqB107o58oSGT2ainKakr5Xkh3EjPt2_vLm0YaupT0PTmQjqc8L29MYYjdsLm3caicUVTUhbdW7gc2A0F_a6jVe4M6w9cM/s473/16624825837446.webp" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="255" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLVXA_OVwoqC4JHzBearnXMsyHheG2fxKn499p3-vyMJAUzQbNUi8gCiZUo2phEL0AzMqHLEoFzOwr_dB9JpFuLnqB107o58oSGT2ainKakr5Xkh3EjPt2_vLm0YaupT0PTmQjqc8L29MYYjdsLm3caicUVTUhbdW7gc2A0F_a6jVe4M6w9cM/w400-h255/16624825837446.webp" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A new PM for the UK - Liz Truss.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>I wasn't thinking of her or BJ or Coffey when I woke up on Wednesday morning. I was thinking of my dear grandchildren, Elliot (nearly 3) and Juliet who has just turned 1. Wednesday 7th was the day they were going back to school. Actually Elliot is starting junior school and Juliet is going to his old nursery next door. As Oli was working I asked Miguel who was off this week for pictures of my grandchildren on this most important day for them. Elliot did know what was going on and smiled happily for the camera. Juliet probably had no idea. These were the lovely photos my son-in-law shared with me which I am sharing with you in turn because I love them so much and they have to be a part of my blog. Who knows, maybe, maybe, one day they will read these words when I am long dead. I hope they do bless them.

We had been to the sea on Tuesday so I thought it would be the perfect day to show my oldest friend the greatest attraction of this area: the <a href="https://www.spain.info/en/nature/picos-europa-national-park/">Picos de Europa National Park</a>. Our  humble house may not be in the prettiest village but it is in a super location, just 14km from Cabrales (one of the starting points to visit the Picos) and the beaches of Llanes. I find that most of the guests who book our house come  to visit the Picos and trek there of course. The most famous walking route is the Cares Route also called The Divine Gorge. Here is a bit more information on it if you ever come this way: </div><div><br></br></div><div><span style="background-color: white; color: #202124; font-size: 16px;">"The Cares river route </span><b style="background-color: white; color: #202124; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">runs into the Picos de Europa National Park, in Spain</b><span style="background-color: white; color: #202124; font-size: 16px;">, and is one of the most breathtaking trekking trails that can be done in Europe. The Cares route is called "The Divine Gorge". The path is carved in the rocks of the mountains and it is a wonderful journey over 12 km".</span></div><div><span style="color: #202124;"><br></br></span></div><div>That is one of the things most of my guests do and one day, when my knee is better, I want to do it too. But we did make our way to the starting point which is in the tiny hamlet called Poncebos near Cabrales. From Poncebos you can take a funicular to what was once the most inaccessible  villages in Spain, Bulnes. Bulnes, one of the prettiest villages in Spain according to the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-20-prettiest-villages-in-spain-wwh9nd6zd">Times</a>, was completely isolated until the funicular was built in 2001. Villagers, all farmers I imagine, had to walk one hour to Poncebos and then a few miles to Cabrales (Spain's cheese capital) for their purchases. Today they have cars parked at the funicular station and are able to move much faster. So, I wanted to show my friend Bulnes which I had only seen once. </div><div><br></br></div><div>The highest mountain in the Peaks of Europe is the Naranjo de Bulnes called   <span style="background-color: white; color: #4d5156; font-size: 14px;">Picu Urriellu </span>locally - something to do with the colour of the rock which is limestone.  It measures 2.519 metres and Snowdonia pales in comparison. Fyi the highest mountain in the Spanish peninsula is Mulhacén in the Sierra Nevada mountain range - near Granada - which measures 3.479 metres. So the Naranjo de Bulnes is not as high but it is still magnificent. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9GQ8kCC42AQwitzZ_k8sgeRA6Bmph0AsZ71D0gcoCppKjT8wNhNojVN47IeNfn4fTLaQu3-jDERzodrRpz1uq5MBBLF9nrZ3PwacB_B5xLmFK09WIreoXVx6hm6be3_uOuCPtfNFy3LqiKAvZeesEM78koZDXizFEjFLPIHKWd1t_t_ZsC6Q/s1024/1024px-Pico_Urriello_Asturias.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="266" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh9GQ8kCC42AQwitzZ_k8sgeRA6Bmph0AsZ71D0gcoCppKjT8wNhNojVN47IeNfn4fTLaQu3-jDERzodrRpz1uq5MBBLF9nrZ3PwacB_B5xLmFK09WIreoXVx6hm6be3_uOuCPtfNFy3LqiKAvZeesEM78koZDXizFEjFLPIHKWd1t_t_ZsC6Q/w400-h266/1024px-Pico_Urriello_Asturias.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><div><br></br></div><div>We saw it from a viewing point from the road and it is clearly distinguishable because of the shape of its peak.

It is the site of the famous battle of King Pelayo of Asturias against the Moors in the 8th Century. Legend has it that during the battle he won which was the beginning of the reconquest of Spain, he saw the Virgin Mary in a cave he hid in. The cave where The Virgin of Covadonga is venerated by millions of Spaniards is a tiny little one in the rocks of the mountains where she is known as "la santina" - lots of words in the Asturian dialect end in ina or in and o's become "us" ( pronounced ooze). It's funny to hear. But the place was packed. So we had to park down the hill and walk up. It was then that we were approached by somebody in uniform asking us if we wanted to go up to the famous lakes of Covadonga. From about March to October the steep road leading to these glacial lakes is closed to private transport and a good business is run by a local taxi firm. We said yes immediately as the Lakes of Covadonga, Enol and Ercina, are in the heart of the Picos de Europa range and are a  sight for sore eyes as is the ride up. We went in a taxi with 6 other people, sitting at the back where we hardly saw anything. On the way down we sat at the front and enjoyed the views of this stunning road, often used in the Tour of Spain as one of the main mountain stages. It is here that my cyclist friend, winner of the Tour of France, Pedro Delgado became famous. His name is still written on the road, "Perico" which warmed my heart. </div><div><br></br></div><div>It's about 7km to reach the top and when we did we were rewarded with great views as there was good visibility.  A young Brazilian girl who was our fellow passenger in the "taxi", offered to take photos of us like the one below and the one I have chosen as my feature photo this week. It was heavenly to be up there. The photo below is of us by Lake Ercina. <br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgriL1dyratmV4jyESXzyDaOBhNZak5R6M6HuYIRbaGwDKlwG-pa9HHVecgGVkNXh3G-A-shuiWRr7SjZAURGLFYFRpG-KfDTrGUzlj4NwSwvg3PRyfdGUevbAkAzIt4MaRHy1Qp1lL9hjtQHiQM2oWJUJo9PWr-vps74OQwpo31PtNiGpMbLY/s3288/8.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="221" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgriL1dyratmV4jyESXzyDaOBhNZak5R6M6HuYIRbaGwDKlwG-pa9HHVecgGVkNXh3G-A-shuiWRr7SjZAURGLFYFRpG-KfDTrGUzlj4NwSwvg3PRyfdGUevbAkAzIt4MaRHy1Qp1lL9hjtQHiQM2oWJUJo9PWr-vps74OQwpo31PtNiGpMbLY/w400-h221/8.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Lake Ercina</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We had about an hour to enjoy the scenery and spent most of it at the view top which was one hell of a climb.

When we started our drive down the mountain to El Cuetu the heavens opened and the downpour of rain was a huge shock. It got dark and was very difficult to drive but we made it. Not everyone did as on our way to Posada to get provisions, we saw an overturned car on the road. Thankfully no one was killed but that showed me how dangerous it is to drive in such torrential rain and on flooded roads. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We spent the evening playing ludo my friends, probably one of my favourite games. I had to refresh my dear friend's memory and was delighted when she found she likes it as much as me. It kept us entertained from then on and also very relaxed</div><div><br></br></div><div>We  had no idea what was coming on Thursday 8th September, a date now forever etched in my brain. I planned the day again. We would visit Ribadasella, a very pretty coastal town about 25km from our house and go on the main road rather than the motorway. On our way we stopped when I saw a sign for "Cuerres", near a pretty little fjord like beach, Guadamia, but more interesting for me where the cliffs called Castro Arenas are located. The beach is well worth seeing. After getting slightly lost we found the beach and again I wished I had brought my swinming gear as it was a beautiful day for the beach. </div><div><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRCQ-TnXgKfFuLJD2ufT4xiH95AL2RwX2q-v2uAbgB_-Um5FeZLHBqp24hrrGWDsAjRl9CAGw5_7tNfPEMEUvuuTSHd90_IKfh-94QRFppVkKEJu2NhqDDTjGLZBb3_fg06voPzZa9Acd0i4bzsef7vxmoth4bfFVGIFXo09wvnDZAeCrc-Ac/s4032/2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRCQ-TnXgKfFuLJD2ufT4xiH95AL2RwX2q-v2uAbgB_-Um5FeZLHBqp24hrrGWDsAjRl9CAGw5_7tNfPEMEUvuuTSHd90_IKfh-94QRFppVkKEJu2NhqDDTjGLZBb3_fg06voPzZa9Acd0i4bzsef7vxmoth4bfFVGIFXo09wvnDZAeCrc-Ac/w400-h180/2.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Guadamia beach, so hidden away it is not well known. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>Just further along the same path we came to the cliffs which I love so  much as they were featured countless times in a Spanish period drama I adore called "La Señora!

It was my dear friend Sandra who was actually at the Balmoral hotel in Edinburgh that very moment. She wrote to say the Queen was being medically supervised and that the Royal family were on their way. The news came out of the blue.

Only if you are British and born after she was born in 1926 she (became Queen aged 25 in 1952), can you understand what I felt. I was comforted to be with my oldest friend. Both of us are baby boomers and have only ever known one monarch on the throne, Elizabeth II. She has been a constant presence in our life, leading a country with so much devotion to duty.

We had a lovely dinner on our terrace, all cold cuts and salads. We felt happy but also alert to what was going on in England and in Balmoral. The sad news came at 6.30 that evening. Again I cried. In fact I cried my eyes out. I just cannot imagine life without here. Of course her death meant the immediate accession to the throne of Prince Charles who is now King Charles III. That will take some getting used to. I just cant get around the words "God bless the King". It sounds strange. He deserves all our support and respect but he will never ever fit into her shoes. She was one of a kind, like Queen Victoria. It's a very sad end of an era.</div><div><br></br></div><div>As if in respect, just as we heard the news it began to rain and we went in. We sat and watched the live blanket coverage, the best we could from Spain as we couldn't get the BBC even though I have a VPN - it kept freezing. I think this blanket news was comforting. It was only about 2 hours later that we resumed our game of ludo and I found it a bit trivial but it was good to take our minds off this sad, sad, desperate news.</div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Friday </b>came, our last full day in Asturias and it was yet another glorious sunny day. I took my dear friend into Llanes which was full as it was a Bank Holiday. While the new King was being proclaimed and all the fanfare was set into motion, we had a quiet but beautiful day together. We were on our own, away from our dear husbands and free to do what we wanted. It was wonderful to be together as we are so close and anything goes and oh how we laugh so much. Amanda is good for me. I can be my true self with her and vice versa I am sure. We walked into the town and came across a little boutique of which there are many in up market Llanes. I spied a yellow rain jacket with a blue and white striped lining that I thought was perfect for my friend. As it was to be her birthday on her last night here, I bought it as a present. She looks lovely in it. She usually wears darker colours but yellow suits her. <br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></br></div></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMxPowsA79T_xaabaB_KKhXsktf6I4CxXj_cFw5dxL8VSwJ61v2RL7d4m6edTtpB_mH6uvo3rLIDzOG-rtqqPSsv5hrkfa5muZWZtEGL4K-sRELhLhHapiyeIWV2Sk6V5FFEa2nFjimIUOAM_0q550ushikJsYZ1uTmio0XAJOkusLD1m54DU/s4032/1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMxPowsA79T_xaabaB_KKhXsktf6I4CxXj_cFw5dxL8VSwJ61v2RL7d4m6edTtpB_mH6uvo3rLIDzOG-rtqqPSsv5hrkfa5muZWZtEGL4K-sRELhLhHapiyeIWV2Sk6V5FFEa2nFjimIUOAM_0q550ushikJsYZ1uTmio0XAJOkusLD1m54DU/w400-h180/1.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Amanda's yellow rain coat bought in Llanes</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div>She didn't need it for the walk though as it was so warm.

There were 2 people there and we got chatting. The man was cleaning his father's grave and his cousin, a woman, was there with him, her husband to be buried the next day. We were very sorry for her as they were for our Queen. It turned out the man, a Spaniard,  had been born in Australia where he lived for 11 year and felt for the Queen just what we do. That was one interesting encounter. From the graveyard we walked to a promontory above the beach and as we walked we spied a man changing after having swum, I suppose. He was fully naked from the back which is most unusual in Spain - but I bet he wasn't Spanish. I naughtily took a photo which we all laughed at as we shared it with our families.

I had booked a table for lunch in the pretty town of Fromista in the province of Palencia (like Valencia but with a "pa"). It is on one of the up to 60 different routes of the Camino to Santiago. It also has a beautiful Romanesque church, St. Martins, but we only saw it from the outside as there was no time for more tourism. The restaurant, <a href="https://www.hosteriadelospalmeros.com/">Hosteria de los Palmeros</a>, is really lovely and we more or less were given a table in a dining room to ourselves. This is it.

Madrid's autonomous President, Isabel Diaz Ayuso has ordered 3 days of mourning in the Spanish capital for the Queen for which she has been much criticised. Some say the reason for the extensive coverage  is because of the Royal family's ties with the Spanish monarchy - King Philip being the great great great grandson of Queen Victoria, like the Queen - sorry not sure how many "greats" to put in. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Today is ours for the taking.

I am routing for him as is the whole of Spain. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Today too the body of the Queen will be taken from Balmoral to lie in state in Edinburgh, I believe, before being flown to London to lie in state until her funeral on Monday 19th September. That I shall watch from beginning to end and will no doubt cry my eyes out. I still can't take it all in. Can you?</div><div><br></br></div><div>All I can say now is RIP Your Majesty - you meant so much to us all. As Amanda's husband Andy put it, it's like losing a member or your family. It is in a way.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Until next week, keep safe my friends, </div><div><br></br></div><div>All the best Masha<br></br><br></br></div>
