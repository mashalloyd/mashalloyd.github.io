<div class="MsoNormal">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I haven’t
written since Sunday 28<sup>th</sup> July.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">That Sunday we
were alone at home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Olivia had stayed in
Santiago to cover the aftermath of the worst train accident in Spain in the
last 70 years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Her friend Dave was there
to accompany her and I advised them to have lunch at the <a href="http://www.parador.es/en/tratarFichaParadorCabecera.do?parador=103&amp;LANG=en&amp;SM=true&amp;fechaDesde=&amp;fechaHasta=&amp;codigoIdiomaOrigen=es">Parador</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The state run monumental hotel chain owns

El Camino. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Monday
morning I had sad news.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>There was a
whatsapp message in my phone from Juan Manuel which he had sent the night
before but I wasn’t to see it until early that morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was to tell me that his dear wife Amparo
had passed away after many months of terminal cancer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I could hardly believe my eyes which began to
brim with tears.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I felt so sorry for my
colleague.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I well remember last seeing
them together when Amparo seemed so healthy in Santander last September.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Along with other colleagues I went to pay my
respects at the funeral parlour at the hospital she had died at in
Sanchinarro.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She leaves behind a 9 year
old little boy which seems so unfair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On the bright
side that day, Olivia reported on a happy story, one of the few, of the train
accident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was about a whole family,
including a tiny baby, who had all survived unscathed even though they had been
travelling in one of the worst hit carriages that derailed just outside the
Galician capital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The story was dubbed
by the press as the survival of the “miracle baby”. Olivia loves reporting on
babies and here she was in her element as you can see in the picture below.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The next day
Tuesday I attended the funeral for Amparo together with my boss.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was held at the famous Almudena cemetery
in Madrid which is said to be as big as the provincial capital of
Segovia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thank goodness we were
chauffeur driven as I would never have found the place where the funeral was to
be held.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We walked into the cemetery and
I was amazed to find myself amongst the tombstones of Spain’s illustrious left
wing such as Dolores Ibarruri, the legendary Spanish communist or Pablo
Iglesias, the founder of the Socialist party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I had expected a civil ceremony but there was a priest who conducted the
very intimate family send off. Juan Manuel and his little boy looked so forlorn
and my heart went out to them.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">When it was
over and we had said the customary “le acompaño en el sentimiento” to some of
the family, we had to leave to get back to the office for a big staff meeting,
baptized by me with the name of “Yoigo Mornings”. Here we were to communicate
our recent launch of 4G, the second quarter results and listen to our new
colleagues introduce themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was
to be the last till after the summer holidays.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The next day, Wednesday
31<sup>st</sup> July my holiday was to begin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>However I wouldn’t feel free mentally or otherwise until the much
expected announcement of our agreement with Telefonica was communicated by a
mid morning joint press release the next day. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
</span>Amazingly for both, the announcement was basically that they, the
biggest operator in Spain would be offering 4G mobile data services using our
recently launched network and that we, the smallest mobile network operator
would be offering fixed (adsl and fiber) services via their network.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I can’t begin to tell you the amount of work
that went into this from both sides but it was my job to announce the news, the
news of the agreement with our biggest competitor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was sort of vox populi but of course until
the official news went out no one could believe it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was on the beach at Santander giving
instructions for the release to go at midday on Thursday which goes to prove
how you can work anywhere these days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
was so relieved when the news was finally official and I wouldn’t have to brush
off journalists’ many questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>And,
now, after compiling the extensive media coverage report I could really begin
to concentrate on my holiday.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We were in
Santander on a quick site inspection trip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>This year at the telecoms conference in September, I had decided it was
time to change the venue of the Yoigo party and needed to see the possible
choices open to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was lucky in
finding one right across the road from the hotel we always stay at.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Now I just need to see if the budget is
reasonable.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">So on Friday
morning we cut short our trip and decided to go to Montrondo one day early and
thus spend more time with the family who were all already arriving for this
year’s mammoth gathering. It was a much quicker drive than we thought and we
arrived in Pandorado (meaning golden bread!) by lunchtime where we decided to
try our luck at the pretty looking hotel come restaurant. We were disappointed
with the meal but not with our surroundings.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">In less than
half an hour after lunch we arrived in Eladio’s village, Montrondo, high in the
mountains in the north west of Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Everyone was asleep except dear darling Pili, Eladio’s youngest sister.
She was waiting for us in the “corral” or front patio, excited to see us, as we
were excited to see her. I just had time to greet everyone else, unpack and
make our beds before I was off again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Dolores accompanied me to Ponferrada where Olivia and her boyfriend
Miguel were arriving by coach from Santiago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It was to be Miguel’s first time in Montrondo – quite an ordeal for any
newcomer as we are such a big family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>The road to Ponferrada from Montrondo is tortuous but the views are
breathtaking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It’s not so far in
distance – some 60km but as the road is so bad the drive took nearly 1.5h. We
arrived just five minutes after the bus and were delighted to greet Oli and her
boyfriend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thankfully he is what is
known as an “alpha male” and did the driving back in my 4x4 tank of an
automatic BMW car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We were back in
Montrondo just in time for dinner. I don’t know how many we were – possibly
over 20 of us crammed in the kitchen for a makeshift simple dinner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The next day we would be 30 for lunch.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On the short
walk back we stopped off at Adela’s house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Olivia and I were excited to meet the latest addition to the family we
hadn’t yet seen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I am not a one for
babies but fell in love immediately with Lidia, the 6 month old baby girl belonging
to Roberto and Ana.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Roberto is the
oldest of the 13 nieces and nephews.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Below is a photo of him with Olivia and baby Lidia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>People in the family always say that Roberto
looks like Eladio. That is true but I also think Olivia looks a bit like her
cousin too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In the photo below you can
judge for yourselves.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Once back at
the house we all gathered in the “corral”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Music was playing care of Eladio’s musical brother Alejandro, some
people were drinking wine but mostly we were talking and taking photos. You can
see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/masha.lloyd/media_set?set=a.10151852449956554.1073741832.612236553&amp;type=3&amp;uploaded=1#!/masha.lloyd/media_set?set=a.10151852449956554.1073741832.612236553&amp;type=1">all the photos of our stay in Montrondo here</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I particularly like the one of all the women
below where you can see four generations from the “abuela” (grandmother) to her
daughters, her granddaughters and her great granddaughters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>When the photo was being taken I was
painfully aware that the only other woman missing in this photo was my daughter
Susana who was in London and was not attending the family gathering this year
(or so I thought as you will read later).</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The afternoon
was spent lazily in the corral where Alejandro organized a makeshift joke
contest which was a lot of fun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>To
Olivia’s chagrin I told my famous “women’s orgasm” joke and which I always
regret doing  afterwards! Later that night the village party to celebrate
Santa Marta didn’t start until past midnight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>We normally never go but this year, in order to accompany Miguel and Olivia
I went and funnily enough immediately got into the spirit of things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I then went back home to drag Eladio, Pili,
Andrés, Yoli and Isidro with me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I even
drank an vodka and orange which Miguel treated me to.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The next day
Sunday, the family gathering began to wind down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Olivia and Miguel had to leave as that night
she was travelling to Seville from where she would be covering news in
Andalucía for TVE the following week and Miguel would be returning to Valencia
where he works for TVE as a cameraman. They went back with Juan and Cristina
who also had to work on Monday.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">So there I was
bereft of my daughter, quietly sitting in the “corral” with the women in the
family when we heard a car hoot its horn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I mistook it for the bread van.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>The men were outside mending a water pipe and they called me to say a
friend had come to visit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I didn’t
believe them as I wasn’t expecting anyone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>So I lazily got up to take a look.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I walked through the great big gate and just saw the back end of a red
car. Then I saw the letters on the registration plate: “FFF”, the same as
Suzy’s car and then I saw her, I saw my beautiful daughter Susana who had
planned a secret trip to Montrondo to surprise us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I hugged her and cried nonstop out of joy of
course but also from shock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I truly had
no idea she was coming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She had decided
on the spur of the moment on Friday to come – although too late to be with us
on Saturday or to see Olivia before she left – Alicia, my dearest goddaughter
and youngest niece, was in the know as was Paula.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They in turn had told others but only that
very morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I can’t tell you how
pleased I was to see darling Suzy whose surprise visit made up for what had
been until then an incomplete family gathering. </span></div>

would go on walks to Murias in the mornings with Dolores, Adela and Carolina
and in the evening with Suzy, Sara and Dolores.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>The walks were essential to burn the food we ate as we all tend to eat

day that I finally opened the pen drive of some old photos that had been
scanned for me. They were photos my University friend Adele had shown us in
London last year during our girly weekend and one of them was with my
brother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I have very few photos with
him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It is not good quality but the
moment is beautifully captured.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We were
both feeling very happy and it was taken at Adele’s 21<sup>st</sup> birthday in
December 1979.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was 22 and George was
24 at the time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This is the photo. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I don’t look very good myself with my thick
eyebrows and permed hair but George looks great.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He was so good looking, tall and talented and
I am so happy to have this photo now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Thanks Adele for the photo, thanks Miguel for the scanning and remastering.</span></span></div>

evening Suzy left to return to London.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Oli took her to the airport in the car and there was a funny feeling in my stomach as
we waved them off in the heat of the evening in the street outside our
house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However the goodbye was not to be
for long as on 21<sup>st</sup> August Eladio and I would be travelling to
London to see her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was great having
her for the week and her surprise visit was very much appreciated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Love you Suzy, thanks for coming.</span></span></div>

it was time for us to leave too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We were
off to Santa Pola after breakfast and said goodbye to Olivia who would be
leaving later that day for Barcelona from where she would be reporting on local
news in Cataluña until Tuesday 21<sup>st</sup> August.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We also said goodbye to my Father who would
be looked after meantime by Fátima.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
should add that we also said goodbye to our lovely dogs Norah and Elsa who would
probably miss us most as in our absence they would not get their daily walk.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">As is customary
we stopped for lunch at the Parador in Albacete.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was wonderful to be sitting in the air
conditioned dining room in sharp contrast to the dust and heat outside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We arrived at our apartment at around 4 in
the afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We hadn’t been back since
last August and it was just the girls who had been there in the meantime. We spent the first two or three hours doing a
thorough spring cleaning as the place was in a mess.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That’s the worst thing about owning an
apartment by the sea, you have to clean it when you arrive and when you leave. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Later I wondered down to the communal swimming
pool for a dip to cool off after the exertions of cleaning the flat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

swimming in our pool at home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Being a Labrador
she should take to water like a duck but she never has until that day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She was definitely spurred on by Juli but

had noticed that in the row of shops opposite our apartments a new Indian

always patronize when at our apartment as it’s got all sorts of British
products I cannot get in Madrid or usually have to buy online. </span></div>

India and that we had friends, Sandeep and Sumit who were from Chandigarh in the
Punjab.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The curry house of course caters
for all the British people on holiday at the apartments and the only Spanish
spoken was from Eladio and I and the Indian waiters. They spoke perfect Spanish

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">This beach
means a lot to Eladio and I as it was where our love was forged in the summer of
1980, some 33 years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>As I write that,
shivers go down my spine with a warm feeling of love.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It is amazing to think that we have now been
married for nearly 30 years (our anniversary is on 21<sup>st</sup> August) and
that we are still in love.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It’s a non descript
sort of bar, one of many on the coast but to Eladio and I it means a lot as it
was where we used to go when we were falling in love.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>For the records it took us under a week to
feel committed for life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The photo illustrating
this blogpost is of the two of us at the Vimi bar last Tuesday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I posted it on Facebook and got lots of wonderful
comments, such as what a good looking couple we make and I think that’s
true.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I mean we are now 56 and 69 respectively
but I think we look great for our age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>In fact I knowI look a lot better today than when I was 22 as in the
photo with my brother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Living in Spain,
having two young daughters and working in PR obviously contribute to my feeling
and looking so good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It’s funny how at
this age one is much surer of oneself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
would never have written anything like this when I was in my 20’s but when you’re
in your 50’s it doesn’t seem to matter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Anyway, judge for yourselves.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">That night we
had another food appointment, this time fish and chips at Darby’s chippy in
Gran Alacant, the urbanization where our apartment is located.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We discovered this authentic British (or
should I say Scottish as the owner is from Scotland) fish and chip shop in 2009
and have been going back ever since. When we walked in the lady owner, a large
friendly woman, commented that her husband had been wondering when we would pay
a visit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He reads my blog and told me
that night how much he enjoys reading about my family. God bless him.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We enjoyed a
fantastic meal of fish and chips complete with “mushy peas” for the paltry
price of about 30 euros which included an “oyster filled ice cream” which had
me reminiscing once again about my childhood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Eladio had the large portion and mine was the medium one which even I
couldn’t finish for once if I was to be  to tackle the ice cream
afterwards.</span></div>

the beach in Sitges on Wednesday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In the

we had another date, this time with Julio in El Campello, a resort town near
Alicante where he has a holiday home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We
spent part of the morning on the lovely beach, much quieter than the Poniente
one in Benidorm and then strolled down the seafront to the restaurant where Juli
had booked a table, Cavia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We had been
there before as in September 2011 and 2012 we had spent a weekend with Juli and
Fátima in El Campello as we will do again this year. We ordered “fideua” which
is like paella but made of thin noodles (vermicelli) and which we adore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was just delicious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The rest of

walking until the sun went down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We
returned to Julio’s apartment to get our car and pack our beach equipment, said
our goodbyes and left for Santa Pola.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>A

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Thursday 15<sup>th</sup>
August is a national holiday in Spain to celebrate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assumption_of_Mary">Assumption of the Virgin</a>.
Eladio explained it is celebrated in remembrance of </span><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN;">the</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;"> <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">bodily taking up</span> of the <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Virgin Mary</span> into <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Heaven</span> at the end of her earthly life. The
difference between the Assumption and the Ascension is that the former was
thanks to Jesus Christ who lifted her up and the latter is when Jesus went up
to heaven of his own accord.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The
assumption is not recorded in the bible but comes from religious tradition and
is celebrated by the Roman Catholic and Orthodox believers and some 
Anglicans. Whatever, it means that most of South Europe is on holiday and the
shops are closed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It also means that
everyone flocks to the beaches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So we
decided that day to skip the beach after so much sun the day before and because
we just didn’t want the hassle of parking and all that going there entails on a
very hot and busy day. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">So we chilled out at the flat,
reading, beginning this blog, ironing and generally lounging around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>On Thursday too we had an appointment with
friends. I was much looking forward to the yearly reunion that evening with Jacky and John
and their sons Rafa and Tal who live in a village in Murcia just 3km from the
Alicante province. If you know me well you may  know that Jacky and I go
way back to when we were children living in Bradford in Yorkshire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We were to meet at a bar in Pinoso, near
where they live, which has just been opened by British friends of theirs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Called Corcho y Copa it is the most
fashionable place in town at the moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Here Jacky and John treated us to superb local wine and some tapas.</span></div>

dinner with their good looking,  6 foot tall boys Rafa and Tal who are 18 and 17
respectively and don’t know which is their first language, English or
Spanish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We had a delightful meal in
their garden and nearly everything was home grown as Jacky and John are quite
self sufficient in their wonderful new life in Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>John’s vegetable paella was great but for me
and my sweet tooth the pièce de résistance was Jacky’s banoffi pie (banana and toffee I presume) which is now
popular in the UK but which I had never tried.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">We were home in the middle of the
afternoon and were greeted in the extreme heat by our darling dogs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was good to be home and to see my Father
and Fátima who I suspect feel rather lonely when we are away. I was relieved to find my new British passport had arrived in my absence; something which had worried me as I would need it to travel to London.  We spent the rest
of the day unpacking, mending an irrigation tube in the garden (Eladio of
course) and I took a swim in the rather leafy pool to cool off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was lovely to have Fátima make our dinner
on the terrace outside the kitchen but best of all was sleeping in our own
bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Also you notice the huge difference
in space between this house and our apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I reckon our apartment is not much bigger than our bedroom, bathroom and
balcony all together. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">And I woke up refreshed today and
happy to do a fast day after so much eating out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I do suspect that I have put on some weight
but will deal with that properly when the holiday is over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Today, Saturday, will be a day at home in between
travelling as, believe it or not, we are off again tomorrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Yep, tomorrow Sunday we are going to spend
the night with our friends Javier and Ana at their lovely country house in
Peñacaballera in the province of Salamanca.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It’ll be a short trip as we have to be back on Monday in order for
Fátima to have some time off before we leave for our week’s holiday in London
starting next Wednesday 21s August – our 30<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary by
the way.</span></div>

next time I write will be after our visit to London which I am much looking
forward to.</span></div>
