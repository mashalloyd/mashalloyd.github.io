<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Last Sunday
when I posted my blogpost on Faceook I got comments from an ex colleague,
Iñigo, who used to work at the same company, Defex.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He said: “Do you remember Athens in
1982?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>How could I forget?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So I foraged in our old photograph albums and
dug out a photo of myself at the Defex stand at an arms fair in Athens, as well
as a photo of the colleague and myself by the Acropolis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">How could I
possibly forget my first business trip abroad? I was just 25 and couldn’t
believe my luck checking into the Hilton Hotel when all my trips up till then
had been on cheap trains and sleeping at sleazy hotels around Europe. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>It was in Athens where I first tried lobster
which has gone on to be my overall favourite food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was in Athens too that I treated my taste
buds to dishes like houmus or stuffed vine leaves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>And it was in Athens where it took me,
together with Iñigo and Miguel S, more time than anyone else to set up our
stand and to take it down in the port of Piraeus.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Defex was my
first job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>When I applied for a
secretarial/translating post with the company after seeing a vacancy published
in El País, little did I know what I was letting myself in for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had been living “in sin” with Eladio
discreetly in a working class area called Saconia for a few months and
searching for a proper job whilst making a meager existence by teaching English
to unwilling Spanish schoolchildren so I was delighted when I was called for
the interview.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>At the time I had no work
experience, no residency and therefore no job permit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Getting a job has always been difficult in
Spain but it was even more difficult then because of my circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Also my degree in Spanish at Nottingham
University wasn’t going to help much either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>People in Spain study degrees that will lead them to jobs for which they
have studied, unlike in England.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>And
having a degree in Spanish, the language of the country I was in, was
practically a useless piece of paper. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The
job selection process took days and there seemed to be about 100 girls
applying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The “headhunter” was a funny
chap called Mauricio Xandro whom I have since seen interviewed on the
television as Spain’s most prestigious graphologist – the pseudoscience </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">study and
analysis of handwriting especially in relation to human psychology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The tests of my handwriting must have been
good as I was offered the job along with a lovely American girl called Rosa of
Cuban origin who was married to a Angel, a Maths professor at the Autónomo University
in Madrid and who, coincidentally, also lived in Saconia.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Whilst we were going through the job
selection process nobody told us what the company’s business was about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So when Rosa and I met at the offices in the
Orense Street in Madrid to sign our contracts, we asked ourselves what the
business could possibly be about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She
said it seemed all so hush hush that maybe Defex dealt in pornography.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Finally the mystery was solved by Sr. Ibañez
who was dealing with our contracts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>When
we asked him, he looked taken aback, took one breath and tried to explain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He said something similar to this: “Well,
Defex exports equipment. We actually export <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">defence
material</i> and added “It’s like selling cars”. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>l was so relieved to hear it wasn’t pornography
that I didn’t stop to think that defence material, of course, meant arms and
weapons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He asked us if we had a problem
with that but we both needed the job so badly we said of course we didn’t.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We were so happy to have a job and to be
earning 58,000 pesetas a month, a fortune I thought. I worked for that company
for 8 years and at the beginning especially it was great fun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Defex exported to all the imaginable
countries in the third world which would buy Spanish manufactured arms and
weapons, tanks and even airplanes and ships from companies such as Esperanza y
Cía, Expal, Star, Bazán, Santa Bárbara or Casa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It was a secret world which made a lot of money and I remember my
bosses, Sr. Trujillo, Sr. Cervera, Sr. Esteruelas, Sr. Comín, Sr. Bergia, Sr.
Presmanes, Sr. Alcántara and company travelling first class to cities in Africa,
Asia and South America, some I had never heard of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I would book them into marvelous sounding
hotels such as the Shangri La in Kuala Lumpur or the Taj Mahal in Delhi. I learned
a whole new vocabulary and my geography of those areas improved immensely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>At Christmas, our honorific President, Lt.
Gen Oliete, the Head of the Spanish Civil Guard at the time and once henchman
of Franco, called us all in one by one to give us a bonus in an envelope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I went in trembling and when he handed me
mine, he said: “so that you can buy yourself a pretty dress”. Thanking him I
rushed to the bathroom to open the envelope and found a check for 100.000 pesetas,
a fortune for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Gen Oliete lived in another
world and would never know that the money would not be spent on a dress as of
course it wasn’t.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Soon the
Falklands war broke out and I remember Sr. Trujillo telling me that as I was
British I didn’t have to work on the project if I didn’t want to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But of course I did because I wanted to know what
was happening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The Spanish government
swore that Spain was not selling arms to Argentina, but I knew otherwise.
Communication in the early 80s in businesses was by telephone, letter and
telex.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Telex was fun and I loved it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You would write on a keyboard and send the
telex to an address abroad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You could
also write online and get immediate responses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Often I would be dictated to and write to companies like Tedco in India.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We had to write in a sort of code which was
even more fun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I have many amazing
memories of my years at Defex but some stand out more in my mind than others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I remember an African “King” called Alhaji
Abdul Asis and two other surnames beginning with A also.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I called him the “5 As”. He was an agent who
for securing contracts with the corrupt Nigerian Ministry of Defence got commissions
of up to 100% of the total amount.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Once
he came to Madrid and insisted I accompany him to shops in Madrid to find white
shoes in the winter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was relieved to
hear I wouldn’t be on my own with him and that the Chairman’s chauffeur, Luis,
would be taking us. This was mission impossible as Spanish men have smaller
feet and do not wear white shoes, especially in the winter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In the end I took him to a chemist shop and
he turned up his nose disgustedly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I remember
visiting him too at his top suite of a Hilton Hotel in London.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>My mission was to retrieve from him a “certificate
of final destination” – very important for shipping arms (but that’s another
story).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had expected him to come down
to reception and was petrified when he asked me to come up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was worried he might force me sexually.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thank God he didn’t but I came away from the
visit convinced I had been sent there because I was blonde and a good looking
young woman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I have many more memories,
such as going to the Bank of Iran in London and having to wear a headscarf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I also remember there being an “agent” called
“Major Kaka” at the High Commission of Nigeria in London and asking myself if
there could be one called “Minor Kaka”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I can never forget either the visit of a delegation from the Ministry of
Defence of Iran or was it Irak. I can’t remember but I do remember having to
herd them into a private room to pray during the meetings and being asked which
direction was the Mecca.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had no idea
so nodded towards the Real Madrid football stadium, the Bernabeu, which I
supposed was the Spanish Mecca and would do for the occasion!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>At these sorts of meetings no alcohol could
be served of course but my Spanish bosses asked me to serve them gin or vodka
which would look like water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was very
worried I was putting the wrong glass in the wrong place on the table but
thankfully that didn’t happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Certainly
Defex exported to both sides of the conflict, both to Irak and to Iran.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Should I have felt that my work was immoral
at the time? I think it did worry me sometimes but not a lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I just needed a job and this was actually
lots of fun and I got to travel to places like Malaysia, Greece, Turkey,
Portugal and of course my beloved London.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>But if I was offered a job today in the arms industry I would certainly
not take it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I always find it funny that
my whole work experience started in that industry but this is the first time I
have told the story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The arms world is
very hush hush and when I looked for a reference link on the internet to
document today’s post I wasn’t surprised to find that Defex doesn’t even have a
website. Perhaps that will change now after writing this story and if anyone
googles Defex they will find this post and find out just a little of what the
company gets up to. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I have
digressed but after Iñigo’s comment I thought it was time to tell the story of my
first job at Defex in the arms industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I hope you liked it.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Sunday too
Olivia left for Galicia where she would be reporting for her programme La
Mañana de la 1 all of last week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We were
in for good weather but she was not as you will find out later.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Monday 10<sup>th</sup>
June it was my dear friend Sandra’s birthday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Sandra is my darling friend from Nottingham University who is perhaps
the most exotic friend I have.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She was
born in India to a Hungarian Jewish war survivor Mother, Magda, and to an
Italian Father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She was brought up in
England and now lives in Brussels where we have visited her in the recent
past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I hope we meet up again soon Sandie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Monday,
Suzy “surprised” us with an out of the blue visit from London. I have put the
word in inverted commas because it was not a surprise to me or Olivia but no
one else was to know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She had come back
to do important paper work needed for her job seeking in London such as getting
a criminal records certificate, a blood test as well as organizing for her
unemployment benefit to be paid whilst living in London.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was a delight to see her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Eladio and my Father were indeed
surprised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Here is a lovely photo of
Eladio and Suzy in the throes of an emotional embrace upon her arrival.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It was just
before her arrival that Olivia was live on TVE reporting from Santiago de
Compostela on a horrible case of a man in his 40’s being beaten up by a group
of young thugs, allegedly just because he was “old”. You can see it <a href="http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/la-manana-de-la-1/manana-1-10-06-13/1865685/">here</a> if you
fast forward to 13.05h.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>These days I
watch her on my iPhone and even now my Father watches her on my iPad which I
set up for him. Fancy a 94 year old man watching his granddaughter live on the
TV on a tablet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Isn’t technology just
great?</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Monday my first
order of the week from Amazon arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
had completely forgotten that I had preordered The Times sportswriter, David
Walsh’s “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Seven-Deadly-Sins-Pursuit-Armstrong/dp/1471127559/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1371371528&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=seven+deadly+sins+david+walsh">Seven Deadly Sins</a>” about his pursuit of Lance Armstrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I devoured it very soon as the story, as some
of you will know, is very close to my heart having once been the PR Manager in

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">That night one
item in the news which we watched from bed as we do most nights, struck my
attention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The CEO of Orange (France
Telecom) had been taken into police custody as part of the Tapie arbitration
case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>As I am a PR manager for an operator,
my heart went out to my PR colleagues at Orange and wished them good luck in
the story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I could only imagine they had
gone straight into crisis management mode, a worrying situation for any PR

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Tuesday Olivia
had a lovely story to report on for TVE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It was about a tiny baby called Adriana who weighed 850 grammes when she
was born in La Coruña.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She was given
just 30% chance of living. Imagine weighing less than a packet of sugar or
flour I thought whilst I watched Olivia tell the story. Olivia was in her
element here as she adores babies and happily told her audience that today 3
months later Adriana weighs 4 kilos.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You

accompanied Suzy on some of her errands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>The heat had finally arrived and I think Wednesday was the hottest day
of the year so far.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>As I waited for her
in the shade outside a building in Pozuelo the temperature was 35c! <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We had time on the way back to stop at Centro
Oeste where Suzy needed to buy something. Needless to say I wandered into the
shops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was very warm and I spied a
pair of shorts I thought might look good on me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I didn’t need them but thought they would be very practical for our
daily walks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You are probably wondering
why I am mentioning a pair of shorts here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Well let me tell you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I have
never before worn proper shorts since I was a child because of my lifelong
chubbiness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However, as those of you who
know me will be aware, I haven’t been chubby for some three years now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I am so pleased to be able to wear shorts now
but at the same time was very cross to find out that you can’t shop online at
H+M as I immediately wanted to buy the same pair in different colours which
weren’t available at the store.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>How can
it be that such a huge fashion chain doesn’t sell online in this day and age I
asked them this morning on their Facebook page?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It was on
Friday that my second book of the week arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It was <a href="http://vidalondon.net/2012/03/25/ghosts-of-spain-by-giles-tremlett-2nd-edition/">The Ghosts of Spain </a>by The Guardian correspondent in Madrid,
Giles Tremlett.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But let me tell you why
I ordered it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Earlier in the week I had
received an email from a British journalist who lives in Lanjarón near
Granada.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She needed help with her Yoigo
subscription.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>As soon as I had dealt
with that we started corresponding. She asked me whether I had read the book or
knew the author.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Well, I hadn’t and I
didn’t but immediately looked up the book on amazon.es and realised I just had
to buy it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was right up my street,
the story of the recent history of Spain from a British author’s perspective,
of someone who, like me who had lived here for a long time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was supposedly also a good travelogue and
even slightly humorous.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Shortly after
starting it I showed it to my Father. Unlike me, my more academic Father knew
immediately who the author was and even commented he had written a<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Catherine-Aragon-Henrys-Spanish-Queen/dp/0571235123"> book on Catherine of Aragon </a>(bought that too now).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>He wanted to read it too of course but I had already started and was riveted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Reading it in the shade by the pool on Friday
afternoon I was amazed to read, when I got to the chapter about how bikinis
were finally allowed to be worn on the Benidorm beaches, that the author,
through his wife, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>has family connections
with the small village of Tárbena.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
read his description of the village which of course I know so very well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I have very bitter sweet memories of that
hidden village in the mountains on sinuous roads some 30km from the ghastly
tourist mecca of Benidorm, the Blackpool of Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>When we first came to Spain in the early 70s
which you can read about <a href="http://mashalloyd.blogspot.com.es/2008/12/aunty-masha-laid-to-rest-russian.html.">here</a>, Tárbena was important to me as this is where I
first fell in love. It was with a local boy, a student of medicine, whose black
clad valenciano speaking Mother was afraid I would take away from the village
where she had high hopes of climbing up the social ladder and becoming the
village doctor’s mother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She did
everything in her power for that relationship not to work, including locking up
her son all summer in his room and colluding with the local postman to intercept
my letters which she never gave to José Francisco. As I later told Giles in an
email I wrote to him to tell him about the connection, I came out of the
relationship very scathed but had learned the language of Cervantes which I
went on to study at Nottingham University.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">That night
over dinner with Eladio at La Txitxarrería I told him about the incredible
coincidence. He too will read The Ghosts of Spain and it is his opinion I
really look forward to as Eladio was brought up during the Franco regime, the
story of which takes up a good part of Giles Tremlett’s tale of Spain. </span></div>
