<div class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Hello everyone, this cold and quiet Sunday in the
middle of January.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The week has
been eventful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>On Monday evening at
dinner with the family, Suzy threw a bombshell, when she told us she would be
leaving home after the summer to live with Gaby, her boyfriend of now more than
7 years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Did I expect it?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Well she is certainly at the age or past the
age, coming up to 28 next April.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I think
I did, as I myself had suggested the idea not so long ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It came to me from Bernard, Adele’s French
psychiatrist husband who visited us last October. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>When he saw that Suzy and Gaby alternated the
nights at each other’s home, he observed it must be a dichotomy for them both
to have to change houses each night in order to be together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He was right of course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>What has prevented them so far is the lack of
money as neither of them earns very much but my advice to them is that their
independence is worth much more than the money they lack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That was based on my own experience when
Eladio and I lived in what was called “sin” in the early 80’s in a flat in
Saconia outside Madrid. So am I upset?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>In a way of course but my head rules my heart and I think it is time for
her to experience independence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>No doubt
we will miss her but there is one rule she will have to stick to and that is
coming home for lunch every Saturday or Sunday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Olivia I think will miss her most.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>But then it is only a question of time too before Olivia leaves
too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However I hope that bombshell takes
a while to come, as losing them both at the same time would certainly bring a
lot of emptiness to this enormous house and life would never be the same.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The next day I
didn’t have much time to think about it as I was going off into my own little
world and travelling to Stockholm for a meeting with the communications team I
belong to in <a href="http://www.teliasonera.com/">TeliaSonera</a>, the main shareholder of my company Yoigo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was up at the crack of dawn as I had to
catch a plane at just past 10. Unfortunately the direct flight was full so I
had to change planes at Geneva airport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I was to use my new Samsonite luggage, a cabin sized suitcase and pc
case which fits snugly at the top and was happy to avoid the bag drop queue as well
as waiting for my luggage in Stockholm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>This was not only a time issue but also a means to avoid having the
luggage left in Geneva. In my experience if you check in your luggage for a
flight with a transfer, it usually ends up getting stuck at the transfer
airport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Being a seasoned traveler, or
so I thought, I waited until the queue to get on the plane was down to just a
few people and there I learned a new travel trick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The plane had filled up with too much cabin luggage
and I was told the plane was full and that I would have to give in my lovely
new Samsonite luggage to be stowed away with the rest of the checked in
luggage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I protested that it would be left
in Geneva as I had an ongoing flight and was allowed to board with it only to be
given the same instructions by the hostess at the entrance of the plane.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>My determination won the day but from now on
when I travel with the new luggage, I shall go the front of the queue when
boarding a plane before it gets full.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Changing
planes at Geneva airport was a doddle, as I got off one and basically got on to
the other in a nearby slot without having to change terminals to catch the next
SAS flight to Stockholm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Another
travelling tip here is to avoid Frankfurt and Paris CDG airports if you ever
have to change planes as they are a nightmare.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Geneva airport is full of chocolates which I didn’t buy although I was
tempted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had asked for an aisle seat
on the flight to Stockholm but unfortunately I was given a window seat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This ended up being an advantage as I was
mesmerized by the views of the Alps and Lake Geneva when we flew out of this
very chic Swiss airport. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I arrived in
Stockholm after 3 in the afternoon and it was already dark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It wasn’t particularly cold for this time of
year at about -3ºc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had hoped for snow
on the ground but all I got was a thin coat that later disappeared and turned
into rain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In contrast to Spain where it
gets light at 8 in the morning and dusk comes after 18h, in Sweden at this time
of year, there is not light until 9 and dusk comes at about 3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The Swedes need the snow to give them so
light.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But so far, they are out of luck
and so was I.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The taxi took
me to my hotel, the <a href="http://www.hotelskeppsholmen.com/">Skeppsholmen</a>, on the island of the same name just a ten
minute walk from the old centre of Stockholm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It is a hotel I have now stayed at three times and if I could choose, I
would stay there every time I go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I love
the place, an old army barracks turned into a very stylish and cosy
Scandinavian design hotel with a soul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It’s like a home away from home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The
rooms, and if you go, make sure you get a sea view, have wooden floors, great
lighting, thick white bed linen and have a warm Ikea feel about them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I didn’t have
much time to check in as I had to be at the TeliaSonera HQ office in Stureplan
by 5.30.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I would have loved to walk but
was in a rush so took a taxi, one of the thousands driven by immigrants from
all the countries you can imagine in the world: such as Nigeria, Iran, Turkey,
Iraq or in this case from Kosovo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We had
a good chat and I told him that Kosovo was really only known for its war and he
agreed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Sweden is home traditionally to immigrants
who have suffered wars or political ostracism from all over the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But like in most countries, the immigrants
live a semi ghetto existence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It is a
story that always fascinates me.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I arrived just
on time but funnily enough two of the Swedes, better known for their punctuality,
were actually late.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We had been invited
along to do a team building exercise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>An
agency called the <a href="http://www.greenhatgames.se/english-games/collaborate-2">Green Hat Games </a>was to be our host.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We were divided into two teams and with the
use of a Samsung Galaxy Tab we took the challenge and competed against each
other via a variety of trivial type questions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>The other team won by a close victory but we all enjoyed the exercise.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Afterwards we
walked to the nearby <a href="http://www.storyhotels.com/kitchen/">Story restaurant</a> where we feasted on delicious fish and
wine, as well as some interesting salted peas in a pod.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Our team is made up of members who do my same
job in the Nordic and Baltic countries, so it was great to meet up with Indra,
Kaja, Mette, Timo, Karen, Anna, Birgitta and the others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had missed the last meeting in Vilnius
which was when my Father was operated on his hip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I also missed last year’s meeting in Oslo
which coincided with a Yoigo event but I am determined not to miss our next
meeting which is scheduled for June in Wonderful Copenhagen.</span></div>

to my hotel afterwards to work off the dinner and enjoy the cool Stockholm
air.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The next morning I got up early
again in order to go for a short walk before our meeting started at 08.30h.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I would have walked to TS if I hadn’t had my
heavy pc to carry with me.</span></div>

the dark and when I left the building at 17h it was dark again, so spent the
whole day inside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Luckily our meeting
took place on the top floor which has a terrace so I was able to get some fresh
air during the day and enjoy the lovely view of Stockholm from the top of
Stureplan 1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Mette, my Danish colleague

and interesting meeting ended too late for me to catch a plane back to Madrid
that evening, so I had decided to stay on another night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>My plane back the next day wasn’t until two
so I had plenty of time for working quietly on my pc in my hotel room as well
doing some shopping.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I left my pc
at TS and went for a walk along the streets for a look in the shops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I love shopping in Stockholm for clothes as
you can find Swedish fashion that I love and which is different from anything
you can find in Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That afternoon I
got as far as the Gallerian shopping centre and my first find was a blue and
white tight fitting striped dress in <a href="http://shop.bestseller.com/vero-moda">Vero Moda</a> which when I saw it I knew it
was for me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I love stripes, as those of
you who know me better, already know.</span></div>

time of 11.45 so no wonder I was hungry at 19.30.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I made my way down to the cozy dining room to
sit on my own at a small table by the window, the one I always sit at if it’s
free.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>And I ordered what I always order
at the Skeppsholmen hotel, their wonderful prawn open sandwich with two glasses
of sauvignon white wine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In order not to
feel too alone, I whatsapped with Suzy and surfed the news on my phone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The photo below which I took on my last trip
here, shows you just how wonderful this very Swedish platter is and why I order
it every time I come.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Thursday
morning, the world was mine and after working for an hour or so and packing and
leaving my luggage in reception, I walked to the town centre, determined to buy
some more new Swedish clothes to add to my wardrobe.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It was cold,
rainy and windy and funnily enough my first stop was H+M which we have in Spain
of course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However I was tempted by a
beautiful flowery green silk dress I saw in the window.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I tried it on and size M was perfect, so I
promptly bought some matching green tights, a cardigan and scarf to go with
it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Here you can see which dress I
mean.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Later I walked
into <a href="http://www.kappahl.eu/">Kappahl</a> where I always find something.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Here I bought a striped jumper and matching scarf and this lovely
striped cardigan with bright colours. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I
must have made the right choice as when I showed all my new clothes to Olivia,
she chose this cardigan to wear the next day to work.</span></div>

<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I also went
into <a href="http://www.lindex.com/eu/">Lindex</a>, my all time favourite of Swedish clothes’ shops, but didn’t really
find anything that took my fancy except for a pink t-shirt.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I didn’t have
much time left or room in my suitcase, so, loaded with my new purchases, I
weathered the rain and wind to walk back to the hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Here I managed to get them all into my
Samsonite case, said my goodbyes and left in yet another taxi driven by an
immigrant for Terminal 5 of Arlanda airport.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Here I had
just under an hour and a half to get through customs and security, do some duty
free shopping and have a bite to eat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
also had to make a few phone calls related to work and in the end wished I had
left the hotel earlier, as it was all a bit of a rush.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had promised the family a Swedish dinner that
night with food bought at the airport with prawn open sandwich being the main
dish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I got this at one of the lovely
bars and the rest at a Swedish delicatessen run by a delightful Iranian
immigrant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He sold me more than I needed
and gave me the recipe and ingredients to make a wonderful sauce to accompany
the smoked salmon I purchased there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I couldn’t
face another prawn sandwich so opted for Swedish tapas which turned out to be
even more delicious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I also need to buy
a book to read on the plane as I had 4 hours to play with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I got the English novelist J<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_Trollope">oanne Troloppe</a>’s
two latest books, The Other Family and Daughters in Law which should keep me
going for a while.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Sleep overtook me for
half of the flight, but for the other half I thoroughly enjoyed the first half
of The Other Family.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I was home by
just after eight, in time to greet my Father and give him the Swedish newspaper
of that day: Svenska Dagbladet and some chocolates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had also bought him his favourite
cloudberry jam. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We had a
superb family dinner with the Swedish food I had bought and everyone agreed the
Iranian man’s recipe for the salmon sauce was out of this world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>For the record it was made of sour cream, horseradish
sauce and cloudberry jam. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The next day
was back to normal and it was Friday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Eladio
and I had a dinner date with Eduardo and Graciela who are our neighbours as
well as my ex Nokia colleagues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Eduardo
is now the general manager of Blackberry Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It is perhaps fitting that many of my ex Motorola and ex Nokia
colleagues are no longer with Motorola or Nokia and now head up or have high
positions in companies in the same sector.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Eduardo commented that Blackberry had the best team in Spain and I
pointed out that most of its members either came from Motorola or Nokia who in
their heydays had the best teams in the sector.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I had reserved
a table at the English restaurant in Pozuelo, <a href="http://www.laperfidaalbion.com/">La Pérfida Albión</a> which as you
know is my current favourite because of the fish and chips on its menu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We had a great meal together and as we headed
home and said our goodbyes, I remarked that we should not let another two years
pass by before we repeat the experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I hope my words come true.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The weekend
has been quiet with very little to report.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>We have done the usual things, make nice meals, sleep siestas, go for
our walks and watch the news in the evening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The dogs
missed me while I was in Stockholm as they didn’t get their daily walk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>When I got back, the new giant sized bed I
had ordered for Elsa from Amazon.co.uk, finally arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was meant to be for Elsa as Norah had made
it clear that the other new bed I bought recently was to be for her only.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Norah, however, has bagged the new bed too
even though it’s far too big for her.. This goes to show that animals, the same
as humans, always prefer something new.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In
the picture you can also appreciate just how big Elsa has got with Norah
fitting neatly in between her legs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
