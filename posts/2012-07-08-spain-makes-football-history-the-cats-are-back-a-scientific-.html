<br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It’s Sunday.</span><br></br>
<br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">A week ago
Spain made football history by winning the Euro Cup in an incredible win
against Italy scoring 4 goals to Italy’s nil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Spanish fans had been chanting; “no hay dos sin tres” (there is no two
without three) referring to this possible win as the third consecutive win of a
major football championship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>After all,
the Spanish team had won the 2008 Euro Cup and the 2010 World Cup in South
Africa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>With the victory on Sunday, the
dream came true and the news of Spain’s historic win made the front pages of
all the newspapers in the world. The debate then started as to whether this
Spanish football team was the best in history. The country was ecstatic with
joy for two days, forgetting stories of its bail out, struggling banking system
and the ever increasing “prima de riesgo” (risk premium). <o:p></o:p></span><br></br>

<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18682470">La Roja was welcomed home</a> by crowds numbering up to a million when an open
topped bus drove through the streets of Madrid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>The team then disgraced itself by getting rather drunk and not making
the best example on the stage set up for the celebrations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The welcome was televised live from their
landing at the airport at midday until the evening celebrations finished late
that same day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was indeed a happy day
for football fans in Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">At home on
Monday, we welcomed back Joe, our black cat who has been missing for more than
two months now. I watched his homecoming as I was about to step into my car to
go to the office on Monday morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Then
miraculously Phoebe also appeared and Eladio and I both witnessed their
greeting each other outside the house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Phoebe had reappeared more recently but judging by their reencounter, I
feel they had taken their separate ways and that they had met again on Monday
for the first time since their disappearance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The week has
been quiet, with not much activity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
had a nasty summer cold which had me under the weather for most of the time,
although I am feeling a lot better now. After the previous week’s busy times, I
felt a little disoriented, as my next big project won’t be until
September.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I got a lot of positive
feedback from the Yoigo Summer party and was happy to send out the <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV6bnxctVqQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a> and
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57521609@N04/sets/72157630340259552/">photos</a> to all the guests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>A lot of
people commented it was the best Yoigo party ever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That was nice to hear, of course, but I tend
to hear the same comment after nearly every party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I am wondering now whatever will we come up
with next year to surprise people again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>That is always my problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>However I shall cross that bridge when I come to it and hopefully, be
creative enough to hear people say the same again next year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That sounds easy but I can assure you it’s
not.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Wednesday the newspapers were
full of stories about something called “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson">Higgs Boson</a>”, which unless you are a
physicist, you will probably never have heard of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I certainly hadn’t and am still trying to
understand what the noise is all about. As I don’t understand it at all, the
best I can do is to quote the BBC’s introduction to the story: “Scientists at
the<span style="color: #333333;"> </span></span><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/space/universe/exploration/large_hadron_collider"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><span style="color: blue;">Large
Hadron Collider (LHC)</span></span></a><span style="color: #333333; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"> </span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">have
discovered a new sub-atomic particle consistent with the long-sought Higgs
boson. The particle's confirmation would stand out as one of the great
scientific achievements of the 21st Century so far”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That bit I do get and also the fact that the
man behind the scenes, Peter Higgs, an English physicist, will most probably be
next year’s Nobel Prize Winner for physics, or so says the most famous
physicist on earth, one Stephen Hawking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>When I mentioned the scientist was British, my philosopher husband who knows
much about the history of science, remarked: “an Englishman again” which I must
say made me feel extremely proud. <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<br></br>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It has been
another warm week but thankfully not a scorcher like the previous week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We spend most afternoons and evenings by the
pool in the shade in our porch and at night after our daily walks. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Susana joined us just once this week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She is very busy with her job and any free
time she has she tends to spend at her new and very cozy flat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Olivia spends many a night there with her
too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But on Thursday afternoon Suzy was
with us, brightening up our lives and it was great to see her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She is such a charismatic sort of person and
I miss her bubbly character.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She went
swimming and I captured one of my favourite photos in a long time, when she
stopped at the deep end to nuzzle Norah our 4 year old beagle who I am sure,
misses Suzy nearly as much as we do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
posted the photo on Instagram and entitled it “pure love”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I’m sure you agree.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">You are
probably wondering why I think our porch is “arguably the best place in the
world”, for me at least.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Well it is and
I came to that conclusion last night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We
were sitting on the benches by the pool with the dogs at our feet and I looked
at it and took in just how wonderful and luxurious it is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We have never lived in a better house,
although I am not attached to this house in any sort of sentimental way as I
know one day we will move from here when we retire, probably to the coast. But
I do appreciate just how marvelous it is and how lucky we are to live
here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I commented to Eladio that soon we
would be going on our holiday but that nowhere would we find anywhere as nice as
our porch and that it will be wonderful to come back to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So why are we going I wonder?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>His answer was so that we can appreciate it
even more when we come back and he is probably right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span>Last week I posted a picture of the porch at
night and yesterday I took a photo of it by day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I felt as if I was maybe showing off too much
by posting it on Facebook and maybe I was but then again why hide something
which gives us so much pleasure?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So here
it is again, just a shot as there is no way one photograph can take in the
whole picture:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>the pool itself which is
just a few metres from the lounge with its huge glass French windows, the
covered part of the porch with its whicker sofas and dinner table we use so
little, the new parasol and wooden table given to us by Eladio’s brother Isidro
many years ago, the patch of grass and trees at the far corner where we usually
sit or lie to be out of the sun during the hot afternoons and then the open
part with the wooden benches we sit on at night, the wrought iron chairs and
table brought from the old porch from our house in Bradford and finally the
lovely orange flowers that surround the pool, adding wonderful colour in the
summer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So, yes, it is arguably the best
place in the world, at least for us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
wonder if you agree.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<br></br>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We will miss
it, especially in the evenings, in our up and coming holidays.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Yes, whoopee, we are going on holiday next
Saturday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This time next week we will
probably be on the beach at the seaside town in Galicia, called <a href="http://www.sanxenxo.es/">Sanxenxo</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>On Saturday we will drive to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ver%C3%ADn">Verín</a>, to stay
one night at the <a href="http://www.parador.es/en/parador-de-verin">Parador there</a> near Orense, in order to break the long journey
to the Rias Baixas area of Galicia where will be staying for a week.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">This will be
our second trip to Asturias which I wrote about extensively <a href="http://mashalloyd.blogspot.com.es/2011/04/asturias-patria-querida-beloved.html">in this blogpost</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It will be also be our third trip
to the Rias Baixas of Galicia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We were
there first in<a href="http://mashalloyd.blogspot.com.es/2007/08/diary-of-our-holiday-in-galicia.html"> August 2007</a> and again in <a href="http://mashalloyd.blogspot.com.es/2008/08/holiday-in-galicia-paradors-castles.html">August 2008</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>My Father came with us on both trips to
Galicia and I’m sure he will be remembering the happy times we had there when
he reads today’s blog post.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Unfortunately he cannot travel with us any longer as he is not mobile
enough but I know that he will be enjoying our travels vicariously and of
course we will be sending him lots of post cards. <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<br></br>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We have been
thinking about our trip for most of the week but the days seem to pass rather
slowly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However I remind myself that I
should focus on the journey rather than on the destination and that looking
forward to the holiday is probably just as pleasurable as the holiday itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Soon it will be just a memory.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<br></br>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">If the week
was quiet, Friday was definitely the highlight for many reasons. On Friday the
girls left for Santa Pola, leaving the house even emptier and quieter than on
the previous days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>There will be seven
of them there and I hate to think of how they will leave the place, although
these days they are much more responsible than in the past.  Since writing this blog, Suzy posted some of the photos which you can see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/media/set/?set=a.10151041806524341.455534.514129340&amp;type=1">here</a>.  Ah and I later found out that they had actually been 8 people - oh poor apartment.</span><br></br>

<br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">But Friday wasn’t a
highlight because of that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The first
piece of good news was the story my scales told in the morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had been on the consolidation phase of the
Dukan diet for just one week and had actually lost more weight which was an
unexpected piece of good news.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So that
night I thought I deserved my celebration meal of the week which is allowed
during the consolidation phase.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We went
to <a href="http://www.latxitxarreria.com/">La Txitxarrería</a> in nearby Pozuelo where I enjoyed my first glass of red wine
for at least two months!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></div>
<br></br>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The other good
news on Friday was Andy Murray’s win over Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the
semi finals at Wimbledon, the most prestigious tournament in tennis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He made history too in that he will be first
man to play a final at Wimbledon for many years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In fact it was 76 years ago that the last
English man won the tournament and it was the famous Fred Perry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We must not forget though that it was a lot
less time ago when an English woman won the women’s singles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I well remember Viriginia Wade doing so in
1977.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Today the Scotsman will meet Roger
Federer who has already won Wimbledon 6 times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>If he wins again, which he probably will, he will equal Pat Sampras’ 7
wins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He would also return to the number
one position in the tennis world standings. So obviously, there is lot at stake
in this match for the popular Swiss too. I couldn’t help mentioning to my
Father this morning that Andy Murray had got as far in the tournament, most
probably because Spain’s Rafa Nada was knocked out in the second round.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Be that as it may, Andy Murray has reached
the furthest ever in his career.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Today
some 20 million Brits will be watching him on the television and the country
will come to sort of standstill, similar to Spain when La Roja were playing the
Euro Cup final last Sunday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Wimbledon is
a like a religion in England, even though British players have not performed
well for many years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>When I lived in
England, we used to watch nearly every match.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Funnily enough though, the tennis fever is over once the championship
has finished as if only Wimbledon counted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>All I can say is, I hope Andy Murray makes tennis history for England
today.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But can he do it I wonder?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He probably can as right now he is playing
the best he ever has and especially since he has Ivan Lendl as a new mentor,
his play seems to have improved dramatically.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Well we will know in a few hours time. We won’t be watching it as you
can only see the matches on pay TV, but, like Andy Murray’s grandmother, I
don’t think I could bear the tension even if I could watch it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></div>

<br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">But the best
news of all on Friday was José Antonio’s all clear after his prostate gland removal
operation just over a month ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He did
tests last week and on Friday was pronounced all clear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We are so happy for him and can now stop
worrying.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We look forward to celebrating
with him and the rest of the family in Montrondo after our trip to Galicia and
Asturias at the end of July.<o:p></o:p></span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Saturday was
quiet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We spent a lot of time by our
lovely porch, the big sporting news of the day being Fernando Alonso making
pole position for today’s drenched F1 Grand Prix in Silverstone in the UK.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However all eyes will be on Murray not on F1
today Sunday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></div>
<br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">And today is
Sunday, the sun is shining again as it has all week and we look forward to
another quiet day, as we count the days until our holiday begins.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The girls will be back tonight and I wish
them a safe journey back from Santa Pola later on today.<o:p></o:p></span><br></br>
