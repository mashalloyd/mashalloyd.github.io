</div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span>Here I am writing this week’s blog post from my bed, my new living headquarters since I fell last Wednesday and injured my ankle.<span>  </span>I have all the things I need around me to continue my new stationery <span> </span>life; my 2 mobile phones, my pc (the centre of my life), my books, the new 42” screen television, a pile of dvds (mostly the Bollywood ones Sandeep and Sumit had brought me) <span> </span>and most important of all the air conditioning. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></br>
</div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span>So what happened you will ask, if you haven’t already found out from my Facebook?<span>  </span>The week started out fine.<span>  </span>I was pretty busy work wise and went in on Tuesday for meetings.<span>  </span>Wednesday was the fatal day which started off with a visit to the dentist to replace my broken crown.<span>  </span>Before I went home I wanted to visit the pet shop to get a special collar for Norah.<span>  </span>There I bumped into Eladio and my Father and we had a nice cup of coffee together. I should have gone straight home afterwards but decided to drop in quickly to Caprabo (a local supermarket) to buy some boxes of up market Kleenex tissues that you can only get there.<span>  </span>And that was my downfall so to speak.<span>  </span>The boxes were too high for me to reach so I climbed onto the bottom shelf to get them from there.<span>  </span>I lost my balance, slipped and fell backwards, twisting my ankle and hitting my head.<span>  </span>I had to shout to get someone to come to the rescue.<span>  </span>People were very helpful and they sat me on a chair for a while.<span>  </span>Nothing hurt so I said I was fine and would be on my way.<span>  </span>I hobbled to the cash desk and it was then I realised I just couldn’t walk and that the pressure on my left foot made me see the stars.<span>  </span>Of course I rang Eladio (who else?) and he soon came with Suzy who took my car home whilst he drove me to the local hospital, <a href="http://www.hospitaldemadrid.com/centros/HospitalMonteprincipe.aspx?opcion=Informacion">Clínica Montepríncipe.</a><span>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></br>
</div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span>I had to be taken in on a wheel chair but was quickly attended to and x-rays taken of my ankle and my head.<span>  </span>I was certain it was going to be a small sprain but unfortunately it turned out to be a bit more serious.<span>  </span>The internal malleolus bone had come away from the tendon.<span>  </span>It was not fractured or displaced but if I moved it was in danger of becoming so.<span>  </span>The doctor put an enormous pressure bandage round both the ankle and my leg and said he hadn’t put it in plaster because of the heat, thank goodness.<span>  </span>He prescribed 10 days of immobilisation with my foot up and a further 3 or 4 weeks of moving as little as possible.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></br>

</div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span>As I listened to his words incredulously, I suddenly realised what they all meant: my holiday in Montrondo and Santa Pola would now have to be cancelled, no more daily walks or swimming.<span>  </span>How was I going to wash, have meals, or do the simplest things?<span>  </span>I also had an important meeting at the office on the Friday which I could not cancel and worst of all how was I going to bear the immobilisation being such an active person.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></br>
</div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span>My Facebook friends cheered me up enormously.<span>  </span>Eladio brought me some crutches which I found very difficult to use but at least I could hobble with them to the table for meals and I devised a way of going up and down the stairs.<span>  </span>It was Suzy’s idea to do so on my behind and I must say it works perfectly.  Unfortunately I wasn't so good on the crutches as I fell off them on Thursday morning and had to go back to the hospital because of the huge bump I got on my head because of the fall.  Thank goodness it wasn't serious but since the fall I have been reluctant to use the crutches!</span></div><div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></br>
