I had planned the trip and the memorial events after our horrible squatter FT left on 30th March and it was a marvelous way to start a fresh page in our life. It has also brought me closure. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">And what a wonderful time we had in my beloved Yorkshire. I left off last Sunday, the girls' last day with us and I wanted to show them more of God's own country. I really hope some of my love of it has rubbed off on them.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We had a full and happy day. We had been staying in the village of Haworth of Brontë fame but the girls hadn't seen the heart of the village until their last day. We set off at 10 am and parked off Main Street. They were to see for the first time that wonderful street in Brontë land. I had to explain a bit of the family's past to them but they soon got into the mood. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRWvA8GV-02j2guq--kYtLFOJ_o5dTn_OZwIQJYZXROph0XsaeOTzgoI9MG1mIHPHGqWyxdUanC0TfhL2zFGqdmND_7WhZy9W7sdfN8f5DjIfNMP4qeVRAbuCISPh6_0cduvDgO28II_kyJbTpX_mlzd_jHDo-fPwr3-m3Co667Mg51N4FStc/s4032/Girls%20and%20E%20%20Main%20street.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRWvA8GV-02j2guq--kYtLFOJ_o5dTn_OZwIQJYZXROph0XsaeOTzgoI9MG1mIHPHGqWyxdUanC0TfhL2zFGqdmND_7WhZy9W7sdfN8f5DjIfNMP4qeVRAbuCISPh6_0cduvDgO28II_kyJbTpX_mlzd_jHDo-fPwr3-m3Co667Mg51N4FStc/w180-h400/Girls%20and%20E%20%20Main%20street.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My Spanish family on Main Street in Haworth last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">It was a sunny and would soon be full of visitors so we were lucky to get tickets to visit the Parsonage where the family lived in the early 19th century.  They moved there in 1820 when the father, Patrick Brontë, who outlived all the family, was made the Parish priest of Haworth. I have been countless times, the first when I was just a child but I always love visiting the house. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHlLZKIORwDgwnPId_M0XszYR8H4MMEVEZA9EMBPp8b4lvUC6-IRCYyAPtZLh5usqs0ZFWloN_Tj74tKPGSoieZWmT4LYNs5vxh26iwhigRp9ONeltvCfhtPgncj2SITV33RjTa_vwc20FgezBsIwToTAxwloTJBCZjzLFhwUEZvPITZfbDog/s4032/Me%20Parsonage.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHlLZKIORwDgwnPId_M0XszYR8H4MMEVEZA9EMBPp8b4lvUC6-IRCYyAPtZLh5usqs0ZFWloN_Tj74tKPGSoieZWmT4LYNs5vxh26iwhigRp9ONeltvCfhtPgncj2SITV33RjTa_vwc20FgezBsIwToTAxwloTJBCZjzLFhwUEZvPITZfbDog/w180-h400/Me%20Parsonage.jpg" width="180"></img></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7FoLmK7clzj2TgXkCxVxBMdqVgP1f5M4A0XkcZYMmdbToLlOmtlRb1u3EfghjYd6E_bBjWLb5EHo4uyIc7TRKpLdOmWm-uTn-DyPWGo-R89RhYNNdQoZt8Ze0PgIc1TYNKceQZWzKytODlm2chknpM_8kRtQKQ1C5ofkvhic7hhQ-NHZjI6w/s4032/Parsonage%20girls%20and%20E.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7FoLmK7clzj2TgXkCxVxBMdqVgP1f5M4A0XkcZYMmdbToLlOmtlRb1u3EfghjYd6E_bBjWLb5EHo4uyIc7TRKpLdOmWm-uTn-DyPWGo-R89RhYNNdQoZt8Ze0PgIc1TYNKceQZWzKytODlm2chknpM_8kRtQKQ1C5ofkvhic7hhQ-NHZjI6w/w400-h180/Parsonage%20girls%20and%20E.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Outside the Brontë Parsonage</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">The girls were fascinated with my brief explanations about the family and I think they loved the house which has been left pretty much as it was when the Brontës lived there. On the ground floor you have the kitchen, the dining room and the parson's study where he apparently taught his 6 children, only 3 of whom survived. Charlotte lived the longest until 39 - so very sad. Upstairs are various of the bedrooms including Branwell's, the brother, with his papers and drawings, the father's and the girls' rooms as well as Charlotte's husband's study. You then go into the modern part of the building full of family possessions including, I think, the original manuscript of Jane Eyre. Olivia bought a copy at the museum shop. At 11 am sharp the church bells rang and Suzy and I wanted to attend the service, just as I had the week before and where I came out so inspired. It was to be Suzy's second experience of a Church of England service and I think she loved it. We didn't have the tea on offer afterwards but did speak briefly to the vicar, who blessed us when Suzy asked him to.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Olivia was waiting outside and I wanted to show my daughters the old school built by Patrick Brontë where his daughters taught and where Charlotte had her wedding reception. Everything was just as it was in their day and that part of the village is completely unspoiled. If the Brontës came back today they would not find it much different.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7SKkSK-PPQCj63wmmPMvOVfZyR1ZRkk78g_yUQi0-ZWrTxfMgQHORHxuqBt1zCk-3NVOF40j3BosOatLJpRbs3DQkMY1V2gNHCecdDJoF89517UiatDdiv-JU-BawtSvgJ-wq_RFV9TYARmSJeliSmnnHecT9Yqvmp4s6Wsdevf4ll8v0c6I/s4032/Girls%20old%20school.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7SKkSK-PPQCj63wmmPMvOVfZyR1ZRkk78g_yUQi0-ZWrTxfMgQHORHxuqBt1zCk-3NVOF40j3BosOatLJpRbs3DQkMY1V2gNHCecdDJoF89517UiatDdiv-JU-BawtSvgJ-wq_RFV9TYARmSJeliSmnnHecT9Yqvmp4s6Wsdevf4ll8v0c6I/w400-h180/Girls%20old%20school.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The girls outside the Old School in Haworth</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">We returned to Main Street and I spied a "chippy".

I wanted the girls to see Betty's too and we actually got a seat and had a cup of tea and coffee. Their food is very tempting but we couldn't eat anything as we had afternoon tea ahead of us.

I got fondant cakes and florentines but would have loved to buy the whole shop; except that it wouldn't have fitted into my Ryan Air luggage allowance hahaha. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidEI9TEgOJBk0TJiVj2s3FzPUHcX0m1SNCROE-Ij17dYJYEk49ZGL6ApLjFW8RwPAk2DRvITOVsflYBQefD93WWe1LTXerT-zfJQ8eO5iKJH4PlRbd6LxVatUDGOHCmXNVpVSMe1gpqSB73vTj2HubhEztO0FyuWc4E6c2dajK6kLO7URCzdI/s4032/Bettys%20outside.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEidEI9TEgOJBk0TJiVj2s3FzPUHcX0m1SNCROE-Ij17dYJYEk49ZGL6ApLjFW8RwPAk2DRvITOVsflYBQefD93WWe1LTXerT-zfJQ8eO5iKJH4PlRbd6LxVatUDGOHCmXNVpVSMe1gpqSB73vTj2HubhEztO0FyuWc4E6c2dajK6kLO7URCzdI/w400-h180/Bettys%20outside.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>One of Betty's shop windows in Ilkley</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">It was a beautiful sunny day and the warmest of our stay which brought out the best of Haworth and Ilkley, two of my favourite places in Yorkshire. It was nearly 3 by the time we had finished so we would be a little late for the garden party. To get to Wilsden we went over Ilkley Moor, the Cow and Calf rocks as well as the pub of the same name. It was such a pity we couldn't climb up to the rocks for the girls to see the view. That will have to be another time.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Nearly everyone was at Geraldine's when we arrived except for Amanda and Andy and they were all sitting outside on my friend's terrace. What a beautiful house she has and what a warm welcome we got. We have had various St. Joseph's College reunions over the years but this had to be the best as it was at a friend's house rather than a restaurant. Geraldine, Bev and Catherine had prepared a spread for a king and queen.

There was far too much and Geraldine ended up taking most of it next door to her neighbours. But all good things come to an end don't they? We left at around 7 pm as we had to have an early night as the girls would have to be up early on Monday morning. I hope we don't leave it too long until our next reunion.</div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We came home with full stomachs of course and again it was only Oli who had something to eat - well, she is breastfeeding. The girls packed and I helped bathe little Juliet who had behaved perfectly all the time she was with us. It was early to bed for all of us. I was awake at 5 am on Monday morning. Suzy was up just shortly afterwards and at 5.50 the taxi was there. How sad to see the girls go but how wonderful it had been to have them with us for such an important occasion and in my beloved Yorkshire. We later got a message that said they had arrived and it was about one hour and a half since they had set off. Manchester is not far but it takes a long time to get to.

They told us it was chaos to get on the flight in Manchester. They advised us to arrive 3 hours in advance as people who are taking too long to get through security simply miss their flights. That day 7 missed theirs on the girls' plane. That was a warning we would have to heed, meaning we would have to set off at 5 am on Thursday - crikey.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We arrived to a warm welcome and large house with a large room and very comfortable bed. We loved our little cottage in Haworth but oh my it was tiny and that it made it uncomfortable for living. It is far more suited for 2 people. 4 or more is too much. Kathy and Phil's house is a large Victorian semi detached which is beautiful inside and out. This is the front of the house and the front garden.

It must have been due to getting up everyday at 5 am and to the exhaustion and stress from the week of the memorial events. We had a lovely light lunch and then I was able to go to sleep and managed at least 2 hours. I could probably have carried on until the next day but we had an engagement. Susan, our neighbour of 40 years at Heaton Grove, had invited us to dinner that night and we had to there by 7 pm. It wasn't the best night to go out but I wouldn't have missed it for the world. So I made the effort and got dressed to go out. I wasn't sure my evening dress would fit after all the fish and chips, cake, curry, etc I had been gorging on, but thankfully it did.</div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was an easy drive to Susan's house as I know the way backwards. It's basically a straight road all the way from Keighley to Shipley - our old house is just before Shipley starts. We were 5 minutes early so I suggested driving all the way up the top and down again to number 5. Oh what memories. Susan welcomed us into her amazing house - a bit like a museum. It was like going back in time and her house is the nearest to "home" as ours was the house next door. She ushered us into her amazingly appointed lounge with its beautiful decor, ornaments and paintings. Her family had an antique business and you can tell when you enter her house. Susan is aged 88 yet her house and garden are in the finest condition. She tends to both which is quite amazing. We sat and drank champagne; not something we often do but it felt very fitting in her quaint and time gone by lounge with the fire on.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhL33vVexX4ZyAKXQcCmbo0peItL0LXg6KPZL8Og_owzovyH2heqIwVvhynpuGwii_n4oDyyXkoZ2ZT4dQLxVINZeMZmzGTa56zqxm1ZmqLIWbRPSi6c5HMb_8kJVEUGso_lMcf9zXdAZvaN7XPXodTr1-ozTLUdiz2Vq3o5F7nLr5sUkD3xII/s4032/Eladio%20lounge.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhL33vVexX4ZyAKXQcCmbo0peItL0LXg6KPZL8Og_owzovyH2heqIwVvhynpuGwii_n4oDyyXkoZ2ZT4dQLxVINZeMZmzGTa56zqxm1ZmqLIWbRPSi6c5HMb_8kJVEUGso_lMcf9zXdAZvaN7XPXodTr1-ozTLUdiz2Vq3o5F7nLr5sUkD3xII/w400-h180/Eladio%20lounge.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>In Susan's beautiful lounge</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Shortly after we arrived, the photographer, Roger, who I had hired for the Memorial Service came to be paid.

He hails from Salisbury and has worked for the local Bradford paper, the "T&A" but now works freelance. He took some wonderful photos of the event. When he left we moved into the dining room; every bit as stunning as the lounge and Susan had laid the table beautifully.

As she has known my family since 1964 it was lovely to hear some of her anecdotes about us, some I had never heard. We later had some of the chocolates I had taken along and bought at M&S but declined coffee as it was getting late. It was sad to say goodbye as I don't know when we shall see our wonderful neighbour next.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">The drive back was easy. I think we got to the house at about 10.30 pm. We went straight to bed and slept like logs. I woke up at 5 am feeling refreshed. On <b>Tuesday</b> we had a day in York to look forward to.

It is one of the finest cities in the country. </div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Again I was up at 5 am. I was on Spanish time throughout our visit - damn. I had time to write this blog, do the wordle puzzle of the day and even follow a bit of the news.  You will have noticed I hardly mentioned world events while in Yorkshire. That's not because I wasn't interested but I was just too busy enjoying our stay.  I also had time to explore our friends' garden and admire their lovely old Victorian home. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg18T22jZs0SG0WXQVvdPOhlToIofmTa6fJf7pOjCmbwp7WVpZrP3aZEuuU55Pfsv1KznjDCUqOGhRYlpqRqamcER1UecPKVaNCsw5VucN9gwlhbKaVw-CXWoqnEXEkukR-jyZqWWcnBEu6k48ouZx-7SYXmv2p_5BMQtP4vrn_yiHgVzq6YUM/s4032/Tues%20garden.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg18T22jZs0SG0WXQVvdPOhlToIofmTa6fJf7pOjCmbwp7WVpZrP3aZEuuU55Pfsv1KznjDCUqOGhRYlpqRqamcER1UecPKVaNCsw5VucN9gwlhbKaVw-CXWoqnEXEkukR-jyZqWWcnBEu6k48ouZx-7SYXmv2p_5BMQtP4vrn_yiHgVzq6YUM/w400-h180/Tues%20garden.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Kathy and Phil's wonderful back garden</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately when I walked back up the stone steps to the front of the house I fell flat on my bad knee.

I really must have that operation on the meniscus, cancelled because of our horrible squatter back in January.</div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We left for York at around 9.30 and it's a 1.5h drive. York as a city is a very big tourist attraction because of its Minister (Cathedral too), the walls around the city, the Shambles (medieval narrow street) and its railway museum which is probably the best in the country. I also love the Castle Museum but there was no time for museums that day. We parked near the train station which brought back memories of my many train trips to York from Bradford when I was a child. York was the destination of my very first school trip when I was about 8. I remember being given half a crown (two shillings and sixpence) which seemed a lot of money to me and having a grand time. Well, we had a grand time too that day. York is a city I can never tire of. I wouldn't mind living there or in Ilkley, Otley or Harrogate. But that's not to be. We walked along the ancient walls starting at Micklegate Bar. The picture is great except for the road works - sorry. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4usogvOP_WY8Zc_DYjvHoDgWzoff8ktdagrtwJAlOzFI2WROHxi4y9XVHnrD_ysVGSEyoMHZClK31GIDAwnEBdxQ_M3JnV-gkeBNkPVfZReGb1RSYG30SzrPtFTGemSfVTTBjsY9BsOvXYy9xOxoDY73Ya26MOGVFPD1QuUqOwZgll1nyHnQ/s2016/IMG-20220510-WA0007.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4usogvOP_WY8Zc_DYjvHoDgWzoff8ktdagrtwJAlOzFI2WROHxi4y9XVHnrD_ysVGSEyoMHZClK31GIDAwnEBdxQ_M3JnV-gkeBNkPVfZReGb1RSYG30SzrPtFTGemSfVTTBjsY9BsOvXYy9xOxoDY73Ya26MOGVFPD1QuUqOwZgll1nyHnQ/w195-h400/IMG-20220510-WA0007.jpg" width="195"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Outside Micklegate Bar</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">It was a sunny day but with a bit of a breeze.

When Yorkshire was divided into 3 counties  the new county town of North Yorkshire is Northallerton, but for me it will always be York. In the old days Yorkshire was divided into 3 "Ridings" and we lived in the West Riding. Today it is divided into 4 counties - East Riding of Yorkshire (so they kept the word Riding lucky them), North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire. There never was a "South Riding", just North, East and West. I hate the way they have changed the counties in England don't you?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The walls don't go entirely around the city, so when the wall from Micklegate ended we walked down onto the streets. I admired some of the buildings, but not the moderns ones which stick out like an ugly sore thumb. Noticeable too is the colour of the buildings. Unlike most of the rest of Yorkshire they are not built with Yorkshire stone but with red bricks, a bit like Manchester. We walked along the old streets of Stonegate, Petergate, etc until we got to the famous "Shambles" - once an area for butchers. This tiny street which narrows so much, people living there could probably hold hands and is a typical and well conserved Medieval street which dates back to the 13th century.  A visit to York always has to include a walk along the Shambles. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgO7KG860Eksh6sSb-pHlf74RGtaUbrw3aCxhkbifyJEj6M-WkGTVqE1Y_UBSp-7xMNGEMpX8gBi4tecmnJoQaM774qRY3ItzDXkUWyUKSRCgbYU8Ip4kiu3I3JzNwsxK1Te12eM-t5ONalqBtaFIfxnrWkVy_Sb8CAAfACoTZXxNiSsjje8LY/s2016/IMG-20220510-WA0003.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgO7KG860Eksh6sSb-pHlf74RGtaUbrw3aCxhkbifyJEj6M-WkGTVqE1Y_UBSp-7xMNGEMpX8gBi4tecmnJoQaM774qRY3ItzDXkUWyUKSRCgbYU8Ip4kiu3I3JzNwsxK1Te12eM-t5ONalqBtaFIfxnrWkVy_Sb8CAAfACoTZXxNiSsjje8LY/w400-h195/IMG-20220510-WA0003.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>On the Shambles in York on Tuesday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">We could have gone to a museum afterwards, but no, we went to Marks and Spencer's.

I noticed that morning the glass milk bottles on our friends' doorstep and had to have a photo. You might think that is silly but it isn't for me. Seeing the milk bottles there reminded me of my childhood when we got our milk from the "milk man". My parents used to order the gold top which meant the milk was not only full fat but had a thick layer of cream at the top. My parents would siphon it off to have with their coffee. Everywhere I look in Yorkshire I am reminded of my childhood. Why I am so obsessed with my past I wonder? Other people don't seem to be so why me? I don't know the answer. Maybe it is because I left my country to live in Spain and a part of me misses England. It does, I know but I'm not sure that's the answer. Maybe it's because I am the only surviving member of my original family and I have many memories of my father, mother and George there. Whatever the answer or combination of answers are; I know have nostalgia for Yorkshire and my childhood there. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhm_2LA2AQ83gVO74uC1z5Bf1jYSXGTlgP0-0fMGcjYJzx1Pf67KnDa-spTWrhGNc1nrvdlU-utAnz3qgrDYZAZRj4EXGYRkX3OX-5DVYhaa1WFcYLZLvNgKxoNcNVDgqbPsqrLKGgcuMeU9hTxUPy9EusSd2IoD5LMQnl4Z-lzPc7md9OZZ2A/s4032/Wed%20milk%20bottles.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhm_2LA2AQ83gVO74uC1z5Bf1jYSXGTlgP0-0fMGcjYJzx1Pf67KnDa-spTWrhGNc1nrvdlU-utAnz3qgrDYZAZRj4EXGYRkX3OX-5DVYhaa1WFcYLZLvNgKxoNcNVDgqbPsqrLKGgcuMeU9hTxUPy9EusSd2IoD5LMQnl4Z-lzPc7md9OZZ2A/w400-h180/Wed%20milk%20bottles.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our friends get their mil delivered which reminded me of my childhood.

Lunch was curry I had bought at the Co.Op in Haworth on our first day there. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">My body was home but my mind was still in Yorkshire. That day the local Bradford newspaper, The Telegraph and Argus, did a big piece about my father's Memorial Service, one week after the event. That took me right back to Bradford Cathedral. It was <a href="https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/20136341.tributes-former-bradford-grammar-school-teacher-service/">out online on Friday</a> and would be in the paper edition yesterday. Dear Emma C, the journalist, will send me a copy to add to my collection. My father would be astonished at the "publicity"! The T&A photographer had been at the service and I particularly like the lead photo of us as a family on the front row together with the Deputy Lord Lieutenant, David Pearson, who represents HM the Queen in West Yorkshire. I still can't get over that. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjys7XihTGI8lzm_cXeOHHKa-rZGua134u4nENVsQt9fz400cTOuJgo5E6BGXFiqoRrYL_7DuKG6oAOQxgIYt7poQpPC6XOYhTwe96W2bWkzsO6g17B5fJEJJ4zzXczcCGbujnE4PpJfdpR0OoYu489BS6PGjC2hup3NysS2YpB9kg3tU0Lhfs/s1200/Us%20T&amp;A%20Friday.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="276" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjys7XihTGI8lzm_cXeOHHKa-rZGua134u4nENVsQt9fz400cTOuJgo5E6BGXFiqoRrYL_7DuKG6oAOQxgIYt7poQpPC6XOYhTwe96W2bWkzsO6g17B5fJEJJ4zzXczcCGbujnE4PpJfdpR0OoYu489BS6PGjC2hup3NysS2YpB9kg3tU0Lhfs/w400-h276/Us%20T&amp;A%20Friday.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The photo from the T&A that illustrated the article about my father's Memorial Service at Bradford Cathedral on 6th May and which was published on Friday. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">I was so pleased that the story of my father's events was continuing.

We slept a short siesta and I spent time doing this and that in the afternoon. At 8 pm dinner was on the table in the kitchen patio with the sound of birdsong as a sort of orchestra while we enjoyed our salad.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">I slept so so that night because of my awful cough and woke up on <b>Saturday</b> morning at 6.30. I had lots to do that day. The highlight would be having Oli and family round for our first barbecue of the season. I hadn't seen little Elliot since a week before our departure to England and I was dying to be reunited with my darling grandson. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Saturday was 15th May, San Isidro in Spain, but also the anniversary of the death of my dear brother George. He died on 15th May 2001, 21 years ago. Skin cancer took him and I have missed him ever since. He lives on in my heart and is never, ever to be forgotten.
