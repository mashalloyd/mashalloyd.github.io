<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Hi everyone,</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">This week has
been busy which is how I like it, being the hyper active being I am and there
is lots to share with you.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I left off
last Sunday when I had just been on Cuatro TV national news talking about
whatsapp calls.  I can now share the link
with you – <a href="https://youtu.be/5PCdPg2tZjI">here</a> -   In the end, as I
imagined, they edited the recording that so much of what I had said was cut
out.  But that’s how TV works. <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It was late on
Sunday night that I found out through my cousin Sophie who lives in France that
it was Russian Easter.  She wrote on her
Facebook, Happy Easter including the words “Xristos Vaskresi” which mean so
much to me as my Mother was Russian Orthodox and I was brought up to celebrate
Easter the Russian way.  “Xristos
Vaskresi” means “Christ has risen” and I well remember being taken with my
brother by my Mother and Aunty Masha sometimes, to the Ukranian church in
Bradford in the middle of the night to attend the Orthodox Church’s most
important celebration of the year.  We
would buy and light a candle – once George my brother nearly set my hair on
fire!!! – and join in some of the singing. I loved the singing or chanting, the
candles, the smell of the incense, the icons and the whole ritual. I did not
understand much as Russian church services are conducted in what is known as
“Church Slavonic”.  At one point in the
very long service where you have to stand up the whole time – no pews in
Russian churches except for the old and infirm – the parishioners walk around
the church all together with their candles chanting “Xristos Vaskresi”.  It was very uplifting even for a child like
me.  Afterwards we would go home to eat a
feast which would already be laid on the table. 
The most common food my Mother would lovingly prepare was coloured
boiled eggs, kulich (a sort of tall cake with icing dripping on the top) and
“paskha” (a type of cheese cake).  Thank
you, Sophie for reminding me last week. 
Xristos Vaskresi to you too. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Monday was my

an appointment with the dermatologist – remember I had a sore on my breast
which scared me last week?</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It turned out
to be folliculitis, something quite difficult to get rid of.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I think the fitbit I wear to measure my
activity and which I used to wear tucked into my bra probably caused it as it
must have broken the skin. She prescribed an antibiotic and cortisone cream
which seems to be doing the trick.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I
also got another antibiotic cream for an infected stitch on the scar from the
operation on my broken ankle.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">That is
proving more difficult to heal whereas the sore has nearly gone.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Tuesday
Eladio was taking me to see a well-known urologist for my chronic o.a.b  which is a bit embarrassing to write about
here. Suffice it to say I went through some ghastly and very painful tests and
got a verdict I had already suspected. 
My condition is completely sensorial; there is nothing organically
wrong.  The treatment seems to be a bit
of a hit and miss thing as neither the well-known urologist, Dr. Esteban, nor
my urologist, Dr. Litton really know whether the treatment will work.  Meanwhile I live with the condition and do my
best not to let it interfere with my happy life.  The appointment was at a famous hospital in
Spain (Hospital Nacional de Parapléjicos de Toledo) the only one of its kind in
the country and it specializes in para and tetraplegics.  It was quite a depressing place and I felt
very lucky as I walked along the corridors and saw all sorts of people in wheel
chairs or moving around on stretchers using their arms! <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It was on the
way there that I had a very old fashioned Spanish business experience which I
want to share with you as it really annoyed me and summed up just how backwards
Spain can be at doing business.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I got a
phone call from an unknown long number and the person calling was the secretary
of a man who heads up a telecoms association in Madrid and who I know quite
well.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">She was calling from his office to
put me through to him on his mobile while he was somewhere else.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">My first thought was, if he was on his
mobile, why didn’t he ring directly?</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
simple answer is prestige – his answer would be that he’s too busy a man to
have to make his own phone calls. When she tried to put me through to him, he
was talking to someone else which annoyed me even more.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I replied rather curtly that I would ring him
direct later.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I tried to ring later but
only got through to his voice mail.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I
think Spain has a lot to learn from their business counterparts in the Nordics
for example where they go to work on public transport, pick up their own kids
from school, manage their own diaries and make their own phone calls.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In Spain CEOS have everything done for them
and “work” from dawn to dusk rarely taking holidays and hardly seeing their
children.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Reality is that they are not
particularly productive, going to long and expensive lunches and staying on in
the office just to be seen as it is frowned upon to go home at a reasonable
hour even if you have no more work to do.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Part of this culture is because of Spanish eating, sleeping and partying
habits which are all so late.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">   </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Prime
time TV doesn’t start until 10pm, lunch breaks can be up to 2 hours in the
middle of the day – and no they don’t use the time to take a siesta - and it is
difficult to book a table at a restaurant for dinner before 9pm.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I am lucky because I now work from home but I
pity city office workers who must be tired all the time.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It also makes it impossible to have a good
work life balance. When will Spain learn from other countries in Europe that
their chaotic working hours only lead to a lack of productivity; not to mention
a constantly tired workforce? Part of the problem comes from the decision in
1942 to change the time zone.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Geographically we really should be aligned with UK time.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">You may see Spain as a place of getting up
late, long lunches (this part is truer of top business men) and afternoon
siestas (definitely a thing of the past) but the truth is that the workforce
have to put up with a very long and disjointed day.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The average annual work hours are 1.686, much
higher than the UK, France or Germany as you can see in the graph below.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I just hope that one day Spain changes its
archaic business habits such as ringing a person via their secretary as well as
their ridiculous working hours.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">On the topic
of business, I was surprised by the news on Wednesday that my old company,
</span><a href="http://company.nokia.com/en/news/press-releases/2015/04/15/nokia-and-alcatel-lucent-to-combine-to-create-an-innovation-leader-in-next-generation-technology-and-services-for-an-ip-connected-world" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Nokia is to “combine” with Alcatel Lucent </a><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">the French telecoms giant.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I’m not sure if this is good for global
business or not.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">If the Finnish
company’s venture with Siemens was a cultural shock and didn’t work in the end,
I wonder what will happen with this Finnish French marriage.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I feel for colleagues who work for my old
company and who fewer than 200 joining up with Alcatel which has a workforce of
900 or so people in Spain. One of President Holland’s demands was that there
would be no reduction in employment in France but there surely will be in other
countries.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">When two big multinational
companies get together there will always be duplicated posts and layoffs.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">On the good side the agreement will make
Nokia a bigger player in the infrastructure market, nearly as big as Ericsson
and it will allow them to enter markets such as the US or China where their
presence was limited. Under the new venture the company will be called Nokia
(they will have 70% or so of the joint company and the French the smaller
share) and will be calling the shots. I wonder if this means the rise and fall
and rise again of the company I love so much and which in Finland is one of the
things the people were most proud of?</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I
have copied the words of an article published by The Financial Times which you
can read </span><a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/f0920c3e-e4da-11e4-8b61-00144feab7de.html#axzz3XkVyYAya" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">here</a><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> suggesting this is the reinvention of the Finnish giant.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I’m not sure
whether this story has any resemblance to the script of the popular TV series
Game of Thrones which I have actually never seen; but there will surely be a
battle inside the new company for the top positions; or the thrones; which
brings me on to my next topic.  That same
day at around the same time as the Nokia Alcatel press conference, in Brussels
the new King of Spain was meeting Spain’s 54 members of the European Parliament
including Pablo Iglesias.  Iglesias, the
36 year old ponytailed leftist and leader of the anti-austerity party Podemos
whose increasing popularity with disgruntled Spaniards is changing the map of
political power, was to meet the King for the first time.  Dressed in an untucked shirt and no tie he
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/04/15/spains-leading-leftist-gave-game-of-thrones-dvds-to-the-king/">handed a boxset of the series, Game of Thrones</a>, to the perfectly attired King;
the King he seeks to unthrone if he comes to power in this year’s general
elections.  He told the young King that
he would like the series and that it would give him “some keys to understand
the political crisis in Spain”.  Felipe
VI politely replied that he had not seen the series and looked forward to
watching it.  This tongue in cheek PR
stunt gave Pablo Iglesias just what he was looking for; front page coverage in
newspapers the world over.  You may or
may not like the guy or his party, but you have to give credit where it is due
and this was a master class in PR; something he or his advisors can be proud
of. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I’m sure my
daughter Olivia, a TV reporter, would have loved to report on that story. That
afternoon (or should I say evening?), Olivia was home, early for Spaniards – at
around 8pm - and together we watched one of her reports on the TV programme she
works for “Aquí en Madrid”.  It was about
“lock bumping”, a lock picking technique that seems to be in fashion with
burglars.  As a reporter for the
programme Olivia has to be prepared to report on nearly anything and hardly has
any time to prepare herself on the different subjects she is confronted
with.  It was funny to be with her
physically and at the same time see her on TV.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The news that
interested me most on Wednesday though was about </span><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11539573/Middle-age-now-lasts-until-74-as-baby-boomers-refuse-to-grow-old.html" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">70 being the new 50</a><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">; something
I had heard about before and totally agree with.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The article in both The Times and The Daily
Telegraph confirmed my suspicions that people in their 60s and 70s are not
considered so old anymore and that middle age lasts until 74.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This is good news for my wonderfully young
looking 70 year old husband Eladio who has now suddenly become 50. I wonder if
the same applies to other ages.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Is for
example 50 the new 30?</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">If so I am now
only 38.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Wouldn’t that be great!</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">On a more serious note this is all because we
are healthier, less dependent on others, more mentally agile and of course live
much longer lives.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I must say I was very
happy with the findings in the research on old age reported on in this
article.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In my view it’s all about
ageing gracefully and healthily, wanting to look and feel good.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I maybe 58 but I don’t feel it.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I have my beautiful daughters to keep me
looking good, I love to wear nice clothes, have well-manicured hands, keep the
roots of my false blonde coloured hair at bay and feel beautiful when I leave
the house to go out.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">But not only that,
I try to eat as healthily as I can by doing my two fasts a week and my daily
walks.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">You will be happy to hear though
that I am no fanatic and can easily be seduced by a piece of cake or a biscuit;
especially it if comes from Bettys!</span></div>

morning I had an appointment with a young student who wanted to interview me
for a University project on how Communications Departments work at big
companies.  I met Irene at a café bar
nearby and it was difficult to get her to use the more familiar “tu” form
rather than the more formal “usted”.  She
was in her 20’s and didn’t know that 70 is the new 50.  I should have told her. The session lasted a
couple of hours where she got a lesson in practical corporate communications as
opposed to the theory she was being taught in the subject.  Here is a selfie of Irene and I just after
our meeting.  It was a pleasure to help
her.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It was on
Thursday afternoon that the whole of Spain was shocked to hear of the </span><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32335842" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">arrest of the ex IMF chief Rodrigo Rato</a><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In Spain
he is better known for being the Minister of Finance and Vice President under the
Government of José María Aznar and head of the Bankia bank which became famous
when it had to bailed out with European funding under his management. His home
and office were being searched by the Fiscal authorities as he is suspected of tax
fraud, money laundering and concealment of assets regarding his personal wealth
which is estimated at 27 million euros.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This has come as a blow to the PP party in power and will not help them
win the elections at the end of this year.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Spaniards are used to, yet fed up with politicians’ ambitions for
personal gain and I think the Rodrigo Rato case is really the straw that may finally
break the camel’s back in their mind.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></div>

A colleague had taken a photo of her preparing for a live report in
Madrid.  It was to be about the return

of a fan by the River Manzanares at the hands of a gang of football hooligans
in the first match.  The story of course
was unpleasant but I love the photo of Olivia sitting by the river lost in
concentration with her note book and phone. 
In the picture too are vital elements for any TV reporter; the
microphone, a hair brush and her makeup.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

went out to dinner that night to La Txitxarrería.  At the same time Olivia was relaxing at home
having dinner with friends from “la manada” (herd in English) as the girls’ group
of friends refer to themselves as. Meanwhile Suzy was in Denmark with Gabor her
boyfriend. The tickets to Copenhagen were her Christmas present to him and they
would be staying for three nights with what we consider “our Danish family”;
with Pernille, her husband Thomas and their little girls Julia and
Alberte.  Pernille was our au-pair when
the girls were small and she was like a Danish princess.  She married her first and only boyfriend
Thomas who she started going out with when she was a young teenager.  They have built a wonderful home together by
the sea outside Copenhagen.  Today
Pernille is a nurse with a great career and Thomas works for Microsoft.  They are busy people and we don’t see them
often but they mean so much to us. 
Pernille touched our hearts forever when she spent a year with us as an
au-pair.  When they married all 4 of us
went out to their fairy tale like wedding and on the few occasions over the
years that I have been to Copenhagen on business trips I have been to see them.
Suzy and Gabor are having a wonderful time with “our Danish family” to judge by
the photos they have posted on Facebook. 
Here are two of my favourites.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">And Saturday
came and it was to be busy too.  We were
having visitors for the first barbecue of the season and we also had a dinner
engagement that night with friends from my Nokia days.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We had hoped
for good weather.  Yes the sun shone but
it was not very warm; perhaps 18c.  In
any case we dared the weather and cleaned and prepared the kitchen patio and
swimming pool terrace; well Eladio did with Gema’s help. This is a photo of how
they looked afterwards. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">José Antonio
and Dolores, my brother and sister-in-law, were coming for lunch and were
bringing with them their guests from England, Enid of South African origin and
Kenneth who is English.  Both of them
live in Norwich, a town very close to my heart, and were or are still teachers.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Norwich is
close to our heart because it was at East Anglia University that my parents
used to be teachers at the yearly 3 week long summer Norwich Russian Courses
from the early 70’s.  I remember going
along with them nearly every year from the age of 12 until Susana and Olivia
were born. I loved the city which is where my Aunty Masha went to live.  I well remember the campus of the University
and staying in student accommodation at Norfolk or Suffolk terrace, the lovely
seaside towns nearby such as Cromer or Sheringham, not to mention the Norfolk
Broads or the city itself.  Norwich has a
beautiful cathedral, a castle and a lovely old cobbled street called Elm
Street.  Norwich is also famous for its
covered market which we often went to – they sold lovely ice cream there.  Enid and Kenneth told me that it is the
oldest covered market in England. My Father and I were delighted to have
visitors from Norwich after all our memories of our stays there every summer
for so many years. It was also a great occasion for my Father to be able to
chat in English at lunch with “new” people. 
It was for me too of course.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Their visit to
Madrid was just a part of their itinerary of celebrations of their 50<sup>th</sup>
wedding anniversary this year. Imagine! 
They looked so fit and young that I could hardly believe they had been
married for 50 years. They are a very interesting couple, we had lots in common
and we got on with them famously. I was particularly interested in Enid’s story
of how her family had to leave Durban in the early 50’s because of
apartheid.  Even when Enid married
Kenneth they could not go to South Africa as a couple as she is black and he is
white.  They were only able to do so when
apartheid came to an end in the 90’s. 
Fancy.  It couldn’t have been easy
to come from warm South Africa to cold and damp London in the 50’s and adapt to
British life. Enid and Kenneth have three sons. 
Two of them are identical twins, Jon and Phillip.  On our walk later in the afternoon Enid told
me the story of how Jon, the elder by 20 minutes, managed to get on Big Brother
in the UK when he was in his 20’s and became very famous afterwards.  His surname is Tickle and if you live in
England I’m sure you know who he is.  It
can’t have been easy for his family. 
Enid also told me that when the show started, her son Jon warned her on
the phone to leave Norwich that weekend as there would be a hoard of media
around their house which is how it turned out. 
What a story, don’t you think?  It
cracked me up I must say.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

a wonderful walk with the dogs in the sun and breeze on a new path we have
discovered on our walk.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Because Kenneth
had blisters on his feet due to so much walking in Madrid he stayed behind but

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">When our
visitors left it was time to get ready to go out again, this time to dinner at
Zurito in Pozuelo with our friends from my Nokia days.  The photo illustrating this week’s post is of
us all together.  Dinner was with Juana
and Oscar, Fátima, my friend, ex colleague and neighbour, Julio who used to be
their boss, Eladio and myself. I was quite tired at dinner after being outside
all day and had partially lost my voice from so much talking in the cool
weather but thanks to the wonderful food and company I soon forgot the
tiredness and when we finally left the table it was one in the morning.  That’s late even for Spain I can tell
you.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Thankfully
today is Sunday and I could sleep until 8 instead of my usual 7 in the
morning.  Also thankfully Gema is here
too – she will be taking her two days weekly leave from tomorrow instead of
Saturday – so she made today’s lunch, leaving me time to write my blog and
relax. It was lamb, artichokes and potatoes made in the Moroccan style which is
one of her best dishes.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

everyone in the house is resting.  So now
when I have finished publishing this post, I shall be sitting outside by the
pool with my kindle and reading the latest book I have downloaded: “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/We-Got-Water-Tracing-Auschwitz/dp/0615806961">We got the water, tracing my family’s path through Auschwitz</a>” by Jill Klein. Her Father,
Gene Gabriel Klein survived and is still alive today and it is his story and
that of his family that she tells in We got the Water.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>
