We are now nearing the end of our travels and adventures which began on 21st April. </p><p>Today - day 46 of our trip -  finds us in Sarajevo. We have visited France, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, Armenia, Greece, Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro and now Bosnia. That is a total of 14 countries. I have lost count of the number of cities and towns we have been to but  our itinerary is very well documented. This week saw us in Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro and Dubrovnik in Croatia, all  countries in the Balkans we have always wanted to visit.  If only we had time to explore them more. We have only touched the surface but must be back in Madrid for Oli's wedding on 16th June, at least by 11th June. But but let me rewind to last Sunday when we woke up in Thessalonika, Greece's second largest city.</p><p>That day we were leaving for a new country and a new city, Tirana in Albania. I have always been fascinated by this little Balkan country, unknown to most and not yet really on the tourist map. I was most interested in its communist period when it was a little like Europe's North Korea. Today it is a free country but one of the poorest in Europe. I wondered what it would be like. </p><p>Google Maps showed us the distance was 403km and would take 5.5h. It was completely wrong as it took us nearly 9 hours!  It was only 188km from the border to Tirana but Google Maps doesn't know how bad the road is. It should, as it nearly sent us to our death. And what a journey. As we left the Greek city a panel on the dashboard showed our tyres were a little flat. It was difficult to find a garage to inflate them as there are no service stations on Greek motorways. You have to get off at one of the exits and hope there will be a petrol station nearby. Thankfully we found one and a young Greek did the job for us. </p><p>It was about 215km to the border at Kristallopogi in Greece which didn't take too long. We stopped for coffee in our flasks only to find one of them had emptied out on to our sandwiches for lunch - boohoo. I wondered what the border would be like. It should be ok leaving Greece as we are from the EU. Even so we had to go through 2 inspection points. I was worried about entering Albania as our Green Card had expired and I had lost my driving licence but at least have an international one. And here we are at the border last Sunday with not a very big queue. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghD1oSOBsazQ23O4QLV-YpR9Q7TiCW3jIWrcph78kk9aq77x0KOa7GM4yOx1D17jDiFhfMpxl2vPepzOpVUnfKrSqaUgZo_SyJy46ud6734aJnU6gdsdTw4BetA9qBibFAgI3i2mZ70SdXBGVvLO6QCd7-gfmt40fEH-dFTWu0jxL6c4dRM8E/s4032/20230528_132023.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghD1oSOBsazQ23O4QLV-YpR9Q7TiCW3jIWrcph78kk9aq77x0KOa7GM4yOx1D17jDiFhfMpxl2vPepzOpVUnfKrSqaUgZo_SyJy46ud6734aJnU6gdsdTw4BetA9qBibFAgI3i2mZ70SdXBGVvLO6QCd7-gfmt40fEH-dFTWu0jxL6c4dRM8E/w400-h180/20230528_132023.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>At the border between Greece and Albania last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgObn43Q3NA8Q8lksWOMcaBpUApbVCp-tuAsoalIiBdyoxpD-C9NRJWS6q62bWhNIXzkbMtfM2Yjh7l9VPU7RvBtkGxEOQSZP0tOI5uXx7AZgEDGfPBBFG04PgKNrU2DQxZKdQxett93t-TblNDWPLMbWNQaX5ka5WfVR1lmAZ6iUpKHZkTKQ/s4032/20230528_132018.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjgObn43Q3NA8Q8lksWOMcaBpUApbVCp-tuAsoalIiBdyoxpD-C9NRJWS6q62bWhNIXzkbMtfM2Yjh7l9VPU7RvBtkGxEOQSZP0tOI5uXx7AZgEDGfPBBFG04PgKNrU2DQxZKdQxett93t-TblNDWPLMbWNQaX5ka5WfVR1lmAZ6iUpKHZkTKQ/w400-h180/20230528_132018.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio at the border</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>I got out of the car to take a video of the border crossing moment, something that we are not really used to any more after the existence of the EU. This is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsE3VjmqWAU">it</a>.  For the record we were crossing the border from Kristallopigi (GR) to Bilisht (AL) (funny name reminds me of "bullshit")  - lots of towns have names ending in "sht" in Albanian I noticed. The funniest word I saw and I saw it everywhere was "shitet" meaning, I believe, for sale. </p><p>Crossing into Albania ended up being a diddle. They only asked for our passports and the "car's passport" and we were through. Here is proof that we made it into one of Europe's least  known countries. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrXXHFO67j5JhHDKh8J1KHaDnDCepqAXDWSNX9Y1JnL5Xai8wn6oK1YkQnTRRflGV6LiD3cdKawN3f3H99_CU_ew9ATJLP8TMugnvU453mZJBzCOfMyU_NBAUsl0sieIx6Wa9vZrAN-PzUZfA-aRhZ-eiiFHOJyXm9WskFuRiEoRxz339hkgE/s4032/20230528_132550.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrXXHFO67j5JhHDKh8J1KHaDnDCepqAXDWSNX9Y1JnL5Xai8wn6oK1YkQnTRRflGV6LiD3cdKawN3f3H99_CU_ew9ATJLP8TMugnvU453mZJBzCOfMyU_NBAUsl0sieIx6Wa9vZrAN-PzUZfA-aRhZ-eiiFHOJyXm9WskFuRiEoRxz339hkgE/s320/20230528_132550.jpg" width="144"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>On Albanian soil </i></td></tr></tbody></table>One Albanian official asked where we going and when we said Tirana, he replied "beautiful Tirana". We hoped so. And there began our odyssey. We had read roads were not good in Albania but I had expected some sort of dual carriageway to the capital. There was no such thing until 40 km to go. We got a bit lost as we tried to find the right road to Tirana and Google Maps ended up telling us to cross a dilapidated bridge. Look closely and you will see it has no barriers and looks like it might fall any moment. Needless to say we did not cross it. It was a far cry from the 1915 Çanakkale bride in Turkey hahahaha. <br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHB539rh-ibvtMI-AxFa2rY6hZndHh3_K5EzvD27lWJwks_LdjyrcisSLVNNOJsGr93llc9nd_Um4kUdi2ZO8mCm7ro1FqFVHzjL6pg5_N7r1eVgj_RvX-PNr5ovetG4c_g-j8vA_le5a2rDBnvxm0i-GUqpTqOg0HUk4eBx-xiy6qlhoVv9A/s4032/20230528_125834.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHB539rh-ibvtMI-AxFa2rY6hZndHh3_K5EzvD27lWJwks_LdjyrcisSLVNNOJsGr93llc9nd_Um4kUdi2ZO8mCm7ro1FqFVHzjL6pg5_N7r1eVgj_RvX-PNr5ovetG4c_g-j8vA_le5a2rDBnvxm0i-GUqpTqOg0HUk4eBx-xiy6qlhoVv9A/w400-h180/20230528_125834.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The bridge Google Maps tried to make us cross </i></td></tr></tbody></table>We had to ask some locals how to get on the right road. They appeared most interested in us. I was equally interested in them. We found the right road but what an awful road it was. What was beautiful was the countryside. At the beginning it was farming land and we saw plenty of ponies and traps and then we went past some beautiful lakes - huge ones. I later read they were Lake Prespa and Lake Pogradec. If we had had time we would have stopped. Then the mountain area began and it all seemed to look like a poorer version of Switzerland. There was much more traffic than I had imagined and with only one lane and lots of lorries we progressed very slowly. At one stage we stopped to eat our horrible sandwiches which we shared with some ubiquitous lame dogs and then continued our journey. It was interesting to see what Albania looked like; dreadful in parts and beautiful in others. We stopped to spend a penny and once again I came face to face with a Turkish type loo. Thankfully there was  a restaurant next door where they had normal toilets. The restaurant looked as good as any one you would find in Western Europe.<div><br></br></div><div>I took the wheel for the last hour or so of the journey and soon we were on the only bit of motorway that existed and then my friends the heavens opened. I have never driven in such torrential rain. Thankfully I was able to take refuge on a layby and wait for it to recede. It was absolutely frightening but once it receded I was determined to "conquer" Tirana as I had conquered Yerevan; i.e be at the wheel entering the capital. It was very much a "veni, vidi, vici" moment when we arrived at our lovely Airbng bang in the city centre. This was <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/651924404753388280?source_impression_id=p3_1685292372_hVN8q5zYmky6XlWD">it</a>. And there were Hava, the owner, and her son, Floren, waiting for us with open arms. They own a big house and plot of land where they have built two lovely self contained apartments. The best thing is you can park inside the property. We loved the place so much I took a <a href="https://youtu.be/VsE3VjmqWAU">video</a> to show you. <br></br><div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjb36u4fbVQdkpJV2Edo5i-2fIpIawes3ugD4pEAcB_CHA0RPqCPR5QxkMBWT6t9a5liZbn8_rKhtlRZPFg-e-n260oXpUc7uhFCQyrtQ7Af8bcNAI9PBGISfffOdiGfS_j0yw2VajECU5spOJUGdAy8emuLTyHd4U3DkGDb2A1hLa1iTGglEY/s1200/05a0e507-1be2-4d83-bb0c-9c66048e10c3.webp" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="175" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjb36u4fbVQdkpJV2Edo5i-2fIpIawes3ugD4pEAcB_CHA0RPqCPR5QxkMBWT6t9a5liZbn8_rKhtlRZPFg-e-n260oXpUc7uhFCQyrtQ7Af8bcNAI9PBGISfffOdiGfS_j0yw2VajECU5spOJUGdAy8emuLTyHd4U3DkGDb2A1hLa1iTGglEY/w400-h175/05a0e507-1be2-4d83-bb0c-9c66048e10c3.webp" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our lovely Airbnb in Tirana from the outside</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></br></div>We had only planned to stay one night but it was too late to see the city and we were so tired we decided to extend our stay to 2 nights. Unfortunately Hava's place was booked but I found somewhere else round the corner for Monday night. Our host kindly let us keep our car on her property. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We hadn't realised as we entered Albania that it was one hour behind Greece - the same time as in Madrid. So we had gained an extra hour. We were bushed and just chilled out until it was time for dinner. </div><div><br></br></div><div>I went outside to sit on the patio and was joined by my neighbours - other Airbnb guests - Gentz and his wife Linda are Canadian Albanians. It was fascinating to talk to them because they had lived in communist Albania. They left for Canada 25 years ago after communism fell but come back often. I asked them for restaurant recommendations - we were keen to try local food. They sent us to a place called Golosa - round the corner from our Airbnb. It turned out to be Italian - Albanians love Italians - but we were so hungry we didn't care and the food was delicious.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Meanwhile in Turkey, Erdogan won the second round of the general elections - to my dismay. And in Spain too there were local elections that day. Oli sent me photos of them voting which I want to share here as Sunday was an important day for Spain's future. These elections are very much a dry run for the general elections this year.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjpA828aPNdSu60Tvqqyqd_ggo8t8S4hlkk1GLHlAGJFXzKORPpvwXAVx5xzn-mz1elNrN4FQhE9ePghQ4tgfPf7-l229HUmxtOQUFL7C4PZ4oOHUGnUBoSd5hR1tuFjlfgqxuXLVE9cfF10K68f2DgQRxo6pWDsc2CiVbuc8FUjLXNhvZDY7k/s2000/WhatsApp%20Image%202023-05-28%20at%2012.12.54.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjpA828aPNdSu60Tvqqyqd_ggo8t8S4hlkk1GLHlAGJFXzKORPpvwXAVx5xzn-mz1elNrN4FQhE9ePghQ4tgfPf7-l229HUmxtOQUFL7C4PZ4oOHUGnUBoSd5hR1tuFjlfgqxuXLVE9cfF10K68f2DgQRxo6pWDsc2CiVbuc8FUjLXNhvZDY7k/w400-h225/WhatsApp%20Image%202023-05-28%20at%2012.12.54.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZcnn3hNE30X9XclejJyH8cLQPLQK9Im4QXhPnjTyETLdQWhTOW2YuCJnmnQZJRzls7MYNPSxLmFmbFhw9Fxn9KSzcbXRSy8yJd_bPHXeX0kDMuiv1eiS97Nbv-12vndiKpp2R6fFShqTWHWflZFp52JnOWjS9k7rigAkUlgy_-8sTO9l-djY/s1600/WhatsApp%20Image%202023-05-28%20at%2012.13.09.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZcnn3hNE30X9XclejJyH8cLQPLQK9Im4QXhPnjTyETLdQWhTOW2YuCJnmnQZJRzls7MYNPSxLmFmbFhw9Fxn9KSzcbXRSy8yJd_bPHXeX0kDMuiv1eiS97Nbv-12vndiKpp2R6fFShqTWHWflZFp52JnOWjS9k7rigAkUlgy_-8sTO9l-djY/w400-h300/WhatsApp%20Image%202023-05-28%20at%2012.13.09.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Olivia and Miguel voting on Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Spain is governed by the Socialist party (PSOE) led by Pedro Sánchez in a coalition with the communist party, Podemos. I don't like communists and I don't like the fact that Pedro Sánchez has to rely on the separatist parties for any legislation to go through. Thus I was rather happy to read on Monday that they had  been beaten at the polls on Sunday. In any case, it is time for a change. He must know that too as hours later he called snap General Elections to be held on 23rd July when they were scheduled for December. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We woke up on <b>Monday</b> morning pretty early. I had booked a walking tour in Spanish at 11 am but we also had to move our belongings to the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/39741462?source_impression_id=p3_1685374733_41rGZsv6OuTOE%2BhU">new Airbnb</a> - a bit of an inconvenience. We would have loved to continue at the same place  but the new Airbnb was literally around the corner and in the end was just as good. The new owner let us check in at 9.30 am which was extremely kind. It was thanks to her cleaner we learned two important phrases in Albanian; thank you and goodbye. Thank you is "<i>Faleminderit</i>" which means something like I beg for your honour and goodbye is "<i>Mirupafshim</i>". I learned too that Albanian is quite a unique  or "isolate" language with origins that stretch back centuries and is one of the oldest in the world. In general it belongs within the Indo European language family but with no conclusive link. The only other surviving languages  of a branch of Indo European are Armenian and Greek yet Albanian is nothing like them. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Thankfully Albanians tend to be bilingual with many speaking Russian, German, English and French too. The Albanians we met were very open, kind, helpful and I would say well educated. This is the complete opposite to how they are portrayed in some Western countries who oppose their entry as immigrants. I was told later by our guide and I can believe it that there is no middle class in the country, just rich, poor and very poor. As we were leaving the flat on our last day, Eladio unknowingly dropped his wallet. A woman picked it up and gave it to him. If that isn't honesty than what is?<br></br></div><div><div><br></br></div><div>By 10 am we were sitting in the Opera House cafe by the most famous square in the city, Skanderbeg. It was a name we would hear often during our stay in Albania and later in Kosovo. He is the country's hero, even in Communist times, for having led and won a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire. It was a rare successful resistance by Christians during the 15th century and he stopped the Turkish troops reaching as far as Venice. They had though conquered part of Albania which forcefully became Muslim - but only a part of it. The rest remained Christian.

Pieces of Albania have been merged by neighbouring countries - oh how they hate the Serbs - with more Albanians living in countries like Kosovo, Montenegro, Macedonia, Turkey and Greece than in their own country. The population, like Armenia, is very low - just over 2 million but 3 or 4 million or more live abroad. It was Albania's most recent history that most interested me. This was the most hermetic communist country in Europe and with the most severe regime. Life under communism for Albanians was probably as harsh as it is for people in North Korea today. In 1939 Italy invaded the country and then towards the end of the war the Nazis. Amazingly the 800 Jews were spared being hidden mostly by locals. It was only after the war that the country became communist thanks to local politics or adherence to Tito in Yugoslavia, rather than influence from Moscow. That came later under the rule of the "father of the nation" and not a very nice one. Enver Hoxha ruled with an iron rod from 1944 till his death in 1985. He split with Yugoslavia and even with Moscow when it relaxed its opinion on Stalin. Hoxha was a Stalinist through and through and even split later with China when they "relaxed" their regime. Our guide told us that when Stalin died, people got down on their knees in the Skanderbeg Square, in reverence to the Russian dictator. Hoxha has gone down in history as one of the most ferocious communist leaders and it's a pity he was never tried for human rights crimes. His statue was toppled down by huge crowds in the same huge square, in 1991 and that was the real end of communism in Albania. But it had left the country crippled and poor especially after its split with China. As I walked the streets in Tirana and looked at older people, I wondered just how much they must have suffered. This was communism at its worst. We were shown a huge hotel built in 1970 and I wondered who on earth stayed there as it was very difficult to visit Albania under Hoxha's regime. Today 7 million people visit Albania every year and the country will grow economically mainly thanks to tourism and to the raw material, chrome. Its other source of income is agriculture. <br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div>What I read would later be confirmed and explained to us by our guide, 55 year old Kole, who we were keen to meet.

So many of them are going up and I do hate them, especially when they are luxury hotels.

He was born in Turkey but became involved in Albanian communities in his travels, notably the US. He was also a writer and translator - he translated all the big works of literature from around the world, including Shakespeare and Cervantes. When in November 1912 Albania declared its independence he traveled to the country. Through his writing and preaching he became popular and highly respected and became head of the delegation that would lead to the country forming part of the League of Nations. Eventually he became Prime Minister when he formed a democratic government which tried to cope with the dismal economy and problems the people faced. He tried his best but lost support for his plan to democratise Albania - no mean feat even today - but will go down in history as a man who did his best for the country. After his tenure he was replaced by Ahmet Zogu who in 1928 proclaimed himself King of Albania - his nephew Crown Prince Leka lives in Tirana .</div><div><br></br></div><div>After an introduction to Fan Noli, a Christian leader who led a Muslim country, we were shown the new Grand Mosque - the old Grand Mosque had been bombed to pieces by the Nazis. This is it. I was not happy to hear that it is being built and funded by non other than Erdogan, President of Turkey. I wondered why the secular Albanian Government would accept such a thing. Kole told me politicians' pockets were being lined with money from Turkey for the Mosque to be built. We didn't see inside it as it is not yet finished. I didn't mind as I have seen more than enough mosques on this road trip; a bit like seeing temple after temple in India.

We only went out later to get the key for the garage door where our car was and to buy some fresh food at a wonderful little supermarket called Conad full of supplies for foreigners like us.

It was not good for the first hour or so but then we were lucky and it was motorway all the way to Pristina. Thus our journey would be shorter than we thought. The new motorway goes through some very mountainous terrain that took our breath away. It may have been a motorway but there were many bends so we had to drive slowly.

Well, there wasn't one which hugely surprised us. It was a doddle getting in. And then as if by magic, there we were driving in Europe's newest country - Kosovo became independent in 2008. We expected it to be quite poor but we saw many signs of development and prosperity as we drove from the border to the capital. There were beautiful chalet type houses dotting the countryside and we soon realised this was a more developed country economically than we had expected. We were also surprised to learn that Kosovo's official currency is the Euro, despite not belonging to the EU. It must be the only country outside the EU, together with Montenegro that uses the Euro. That would make life easier for us. <br></br></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></br>We carried on the same motorway, most of it in torrential rain  of which we have had our fair share on this trip - damn it. Soon we were entering the capital which only has a population of just over 200.000 but is total chaos when it comes to traffic. It took us an age to find our destination - a supermarket next to the flat. Check in was damned difficult. I had to find and go into a "shisha" bar to ask for the keys where one of the men sitting and smoking got up lazily to give me the keys.  Then I had to go and find Eladio in the car at the supermarket car park where they were threatening to tow it away and find somewhere to park. Our Airnbn host had "parking on the premises" included on her listing and I was a bit cross as it was street parking and at least two streets away with hardly anywhere to park. It took us an age to find a space and then had to lug all our belongings up to the fifth floor of a red bricked block of flats. By the time we were in it was at least 4.30, we were tired, it was raining and had no time left really to explore the city centre which was much further away than listed - a 25 minute walk which would have been in the rain. So, we decided to add another night, just chill out and explore the city on Wednesday. </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></br>The Airbnb was a great <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/37234713?source_impression_id=p3_1685374804_6SAJ%2F7qUn7yr422a">apartment</a> and at 40 euros a night we had no complaints. But it was not that well equipped. I have missed microwaves and toasters at most places we have been to and in Tirana and in Pristina there was hardly any toilet paper! I wondered if that was to save money. Thankfully there was a supermarket right next to the flat where we went in search of the essential item and a few more while we were there. Here is Eladio shopping in Pristina - a first for us both. The supermarket was called Viva Fresh Store and is open 24h. It wasn't badly stocked but was pretty run of the mill. <br></br><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVidWy2rRiRTfzh5lAB47tkyp9lqj3JI8Qup-Nfp9RvFOaPIHHs6_9rN0XSSxTEIscq_ZyPbdoz533eyS1oqrWCvQx676FWhTHW8nn3vuVILgMWRy9xXEz4jAFGPjf1U6mCebw_kjoBDaiFI0R8eRcFE4zZPOWRb7UYmthdWa7rsxNT_Tvkoo/s4032/20230530_185910.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgVidWy2rRiRTfzh5lAB47tkyp9lqj3JI8Qup-Nfp9RvFOaPIHHs6_9rN0XSSxTEIscq_ZyPbdoz533eyS1oqrWCvQx676FWhTHW8nn3vuVILgMWRy9xXEz4jAFGPjf1U6mCebw_kjoBDaiFI0R8eRcFE4zZPOWRb7UYmthdWa7rsxNT_Tvkoo/w400-h180/20230530_185910.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Shopping at Viva Fresh in Pristina</i><br></br></td></tr></tbody></table>Later we sat on the balcony until it was dusk watching the nearby roundabout heaving with traffic.

It is only towards the end of our road trip that I have come across a free walking trip app called Guru Walks. But for Kosovo I booked one on a site called Pristina Free Walking Tours. We would meet our guide the next day at 10 am outside the National Theatre. </p><p>For the record, after the Balkan Wars, Kosovo - the smallest Balkan country -  mainly a Muslim country with an Albanian speaking population, declared its independence from Serbia in 2008. Serbia and some other countries, including Spain, Russia and China, do no recognise it as a country. But the US does after Bill Clinton ordered an intervention in the Balkan War that stopped further massacres from Serbia. Since then there is a NATO peace keeping mission called KFOR (Kosovo Force) with a permanent presence in Kosovo. If NATO left and Serbia wanted, maybe with the blessing of Russia, it could easily do away with this fledgling young state that only wants peace. Kosovo has a minority Serbian population, mainly in the north where there have been some recent disturbances. In local elections where the Serbs deliberately did not vote, the Kosovars won and swore in one or two Lord Mayors. The local Serbs, furious that they had won the elections when less than 3% of the population voted, protested. Their protests became violent and they attacked some NATO peacekeeping forces. So there is a bit of violence going on. The other big issues are things like local number plates which ethnic Serbs refuse to use. Both countries want to join the EU but have been told that first they have to settle their disputes which I doubt will happen fast. <br></br></p><p>The earlier history of this "country" is similar to Albania's and the national hero is, you guessed it; Skanderbeg - the 15th century warrior who fought successfully against the Ottoman Empire, impeding its spread to the rest of the country and even to Italy.</p><p>Of course the most famous Albanian we are familiar with is Mother Teresa of Calcutta. The main street in Kosovo is called after her and recently a cathedral was built in her name in the city centre.  Mother Teresa was born in Skopje, now North Macedonia but her parents were Albanian and according to our guide in Kosovo, her mother was from Pristina. They resetelled in Pristina when Saint Teresa was just 18. She is highly revered in this area as we would learn on our "free" walking tour in Kosovo, which says a lot from a country which is 90% Muslim. We learned this week that people of all religions - Muslim, Orthodox and Catholic - live in complete harmony in the Balkans. That's good to hear although I never got that impression given what happened in the Balkan Wars. <br></br></p><p>After I had had my bought of local history and after our shopping trip, we had a meal of leftovers and went to bed incredibly early at around 8.30 pm. I fell asleep reading a fascinating book by an Albanian woman who lived under communism as a child. I am devouring the book called <a href="https://www.pagesofhackney.co.uk/webshop/product/free-lea-ypi-pb/">"Free: Coming of Age at the End of History" by Lea Api. </a>It was the Sunday Times Memoir of the Year and tells me so much about this once hermetic state. </p><p>As I went to bed so early, I rose at 5 am on <b>Wednesday</b> morning with my eyes wide open. It was raining again, on and off, most of the day, except, luckily, during our city tour. </p><p>We took a taxi to the centre which, like Tirana, is Skanderbeg Square where we were to meet our guide, Astrit, on the steps of the National Theatre at 10 am. We got there early and decided to explore the terrain and have a cofffee - or a macchiato which is what is served everywhere in Kosovo - not the Italian type but more like a small capuccino but still lovely. </p><p>We came face to face with the warrior Skanderbeg whose real name was George Kastriot - Skanderbeg meaning Alexander the Great. Our guide later told us he became known as this because his fighting skills were as great as the real Alexander the Great. <br></br></p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0X1VgNigd9voc_E6_ddYNEufhI5Iec2YDuzbci07ZMav4Wpar-FxHH_JHWAZxYK4A_xMctujEoj3eDZmfJMCkwPyngjVqS7ab0L_435hWM3_JaIwSsXzTSoy2aDtcoaflCor43QpCvDdULZTc5vRTv7JX-ZP3Hg3d2aCwjiKiCESk3aYA7iw/s4032/20230531_085029.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0X1VgNigd9voc_E6_ddYNEufhI5Iec2YDuzbci07ZMav4Wpar-FxHH_JHWAZxYK4A_xMctujEoj3eDZmfJMCkwPyngjVqS7ab0L_435hWM3_JaIwSsXzTSoy2aDtcoaflCor43QpCvDdULZTc5vRTv7JX-ZP3Hg3d2aCwjiKiCESk3aYA7iw/w180-h400/20230531_085029.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Next to the Skanderbeg statue in the square of the same name in Pristina on Wednesday</i><br></br></td></tr></tbody></table>The square then turns into a boulevard towards the more modern part of the city and it is named after Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

We didn't see many tourists around and we were there just after the disturbances I mentioned earlier. Were we stupid visiting Kosovo? Was it dangerous? I don't think so from what we saw and heard in Pristina but my dear friend Sandra later made a comment which brought it home to me but also made me roar with laughter. Let me share it with you: "<i>Not many people I know have been to Kosovo other than on a humanitarian mission! But then again, you are one of a kind</i>". It was only after our morning city tour that another person, David, a friend of my parents warned me that Nato was preparing for the worst. These are the words of Nato's press release: "<i>Nato Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg announced today during a Press Conference that 700 NATO troops from the Rapid Reaction Force will arrive in Kosovo within the next 24 hours in order to reinforce (KFOR) the Peace keeping Mission already in the country, while a Batallion of rougly 1.000 Reserve Troops has been placed into a high state of readiness able to be deployed into Kosovo within hours</i>" I think if this press release had been issued earlier, we may well not have gone. However, everyone I met in Pristina seemed to be very calm and one person told me it was the press mongerers who made things look worse than they are. I don't think NATO would be getting ready for the worst just for the sake of it. </p><p>I didn't know this when we had a chat with the waiter at the cafe we went to when we had half an hour to kill before joining the walking tour. We went also to have a coffee and to use the wifi. He was a young man aged about 30 and spoke good English so we quizzed him on his city and country and what living there was like. First things first he told us Albanians were their "brothers".  He was equally interested to know what our impressions of the city were even though we had only been there for one night. He told us his country was safe despite the disturbances and that life was quiet in Pristina. He complained though that it is difficult for young people, many of whom emigrate for a better life. His brother lives in Germany and his two sisters in Italy. He told us the average salary is between 300 and 400 euros a month which is not enough to live independently because rent costs about the same. As to buying an apartment it is nearly impossible as the price is around 90.000 euros. We told him it was similar elsewhere. Young people may earn more in Spain - say 1000 euros a month but you can't get a house for under 200.000 euros. He also told us there were plenty of jobs but the salary is always the same.</p><p>It was interesting to talk to a local. We thanked him for his time and went to find our tour guide Astrit. There were two other tourists, a Portuguese chap called Francisco who is a tour guide himself, bringing Portuguese tourists to the Balkans and who wanted to refresh his memory of Pristina, and a young girl from Washington who never uttered a word.</p><p>Our tour began by the statue of Skanderbeg with whom we were already acquainted. Astrit then took us towards the old town, not much of which is left after wars. But it is where the city began and there is much evidence of the presence of the Ottoman Empire. However, many buildings from that time sadly  no longer exist after the modernisation period of the 50's and 60's when Kosovo belonged to Yugoslavia and was semi communist. The slogan was "destroy the old, build the new" and because of this most of the main old buildings and places of Pristina no longer exist. <br></br></p><p></p><p>But not everything was destroyed, thank goodness. We were shown the oldest Mosque commonly known as the Bazaar Mosque but whose correct name is the Carshi (stone) Mosque built in 1389. <br></br></p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiS9VLRctQiVyde4TlVwVqhHmMGMIM3xJOl1rVLSWPgPE-3mL9ZvF8VeVK2icGkwfHM9wBXghH5Ew1_DtlgEKFJSg6bsAbrK_n1ZSrt0w49klLhSmrzF8PJxYGzIVqoH__Y7dT7UMu3pT60nH2cv5hu6uuMiKf2ChG-qoCG635ezT6ABdxWSIk/s4032/20230531_102255.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiS9VLRctQiVyde4TlVwVqhHmMGMIM3xJOl1rVLSWPgPE-3mL9ZvF8VeVK2icGkwfHM9wBXghH5Ew1_DtlgEKFJSg6bsAbrK_n1ZSrt0w49klLhSmrzF8PJxYGzIVqoH__Y7dT7UMu3pT60nH2cv5hu6uuMiKf2ChG-qoCG635ezT6ABdxWSIk/w180-h400/20230531_102255.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The old Bazaar Mosque - the oldest building in Pristina<br></br></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>It didn't seem very busy, nothing like the Mosques in Turkey. In fact, although both Kosovo and Albania are Muslim countries they are much more lax than other Muslim countries. We saw very few women wearing veils - a good sign in my opinion. </p><p>We saw the outside of the Museum of Kosovo and were astounded to hear that during the Kosovo War the Serbs robbed it of all its contents, only giving back one or two items. However, the Kosovar people have filled it with new content from donations from around the country. We then visited the small Ethnological Museum which I was most interested in. It was really a family home owned by a rich famil called Emin Gjikolli who built it. The family fled Kosovo in 1959 but oh what a treasure they left behind, a house from the 18th century and its outhouses in the style of the time. I would have loved to know more about the family, who they were, why they fled and what became of them.<br></br></p><p><br></br></p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjaH2LJ7mL0SACGh28IpwrtOVK5800XG1--PpTiA7ngYQPpRjKAXy7n1gTvG8m4xIcfmFh6lKzcjMESn5yVForSFuBTlt87jC58N9qcjE5Hp4VghY6mo1-bxDCk9AdwFK4h694JTODuX1khQKYOBGiP-Goc_mOU0V45FxZVwOYLsD_sNuw8qOA/s4032/20230531_104201.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjaH2LJ7mL0SACGh28IpwrtOVK5800XG1--PpTiA7ngYQPpRjKAXy7n1gTvG8m4xIcfmFh6lKzcjMESn5yVForSFuBTlt87jC58N9qcjE5Hp4VghY6mo1-bxDCk9AdwFK4h694JTODuX1khQKYOBGiP-Goc_mOU0V45FxZVwOYLsD_sNuw8qOA/w400-h180/20230531_104201.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Outside one of the houses of the Ethnological Museum in Pristina</i><br></br></td></tr></tbody></table>Nearby is the new Bazaar -  the old one was destroyed in the 50's and 60's.

There is also a statue of Bill "Klinton" and a road called "Xhorxh Bush". As I said above, if one day the US removes its support of Kosovo, this new country would probably not survive. That is probably why the KOFR NATO forces are still there. Both Eladio and I had to explain why Spain doesn't recognise Kosovar either, something our guide was fully aware of. It doesn't, simply because of the issue with Catalonia. What can I say? <br></br></p><p>A little further on is the Newborn Monument, perhaps Pristina's biggest tourist attraction - not that it has many I'm afraid. Originally the words were Newborn but every year the words are changed to give a different message. This is the one we saw which reads: No New Broken Republic. I had to look up the meaning and it is actually an anagram that says NO to a broken republic that is being torn apart. Everyone was taking photos - me too and I asked the lovely Portuguese guy to take a photo of the two of us in memory of our visit to Kosovo. This is the photo I have chosen as this week's feature photo - it had to be of the two of us in Pristina. <br></br></p><p><span></span></p><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEids8R2zAKtE_KMDCg_2AEmagBq_kphi0-aiOheJSrjemcn9ZIDI5M2Vk9hdxxS4OEjt7jVzFwIj8DpTLAM7xsZjsWrN-42AVpIjlKcK1WukFfcMY7r9DUMe-Vpx03P8vUc0GIVykh5mt3MtFkYu9YNLA5vVMX6siPc_L9IStjgzPB_faCYYP0/s3417/20230531_113507.jpg"><img height="213" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEids8R2zAKtE_KMDCg_2AEmagBq_kphi0-aiOheJSrjemcn9ZIDI5M2Vk9hdxxS4OEjt7jVzFwIj8DpTLAM7xsZjsWrN-42AVpIjlKcK1WukFfcMY7r9DUMe-Vpx03P8vUc0GIVykh5mt3MtFkYu9YNLA5vVMX6siPc_L9IStjgzPB_faCYYP0/w400-h213/20230531_113507.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>The Newborn Monument in Kosovo which changes colours and words nearly every year. <br></br></i></div><p>Just across the road was the last monument I saw and it was the one that made the most impact on me and is my take away from the city tour. Called The Herionat Memorial it is dedicated to the more than 20.000 Albanian Kosovar women raped during the Kosovo War from 1998 to 1999.  Many of these women are still alive. It is made of pins each representing one woman and they are at different levels and heights which  create a portrait of a woman. It made me feel sick as I came face to face with those terrible troubled times which I'm not sure are over given the current situation after the disturbances over the elections in the north of the country. Eladio wanted to get out of the country that very night when he read more on the problem. I had to talk him out of it as we couldn't just leave and had to wait until the following morning. But we did want to get out.

Ever since we left Madrid on 21st April, Eladio had been waiting to cut his hair when we reached Pristina. Why you may wonder? Because he had read somewhere that it only costs 1 euros. So when I spied a barber's, we went in and Eladio got his hair cut which I documented on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElvByU0RjMQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">YouTube</a>. The only thing is that his information was outdated hahaha and cost 6 euros but it was well worth it. His hair had grown into veritable locks and I couldn't wait for us to arrive in Kosovo for him to cut them and didn't care if it cost, 1, 6 or 60 euros. His hair needed cutting. And here are some photos to prove my husband had his hair cut in Kosovo. The name of the Barber's was "Barber Lux". I had hoped to promote it on Instagram but it's not there hahahaha. Enjoy the photos. We thoroughly enjoyed the moment. <br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgmWTOrt2HObu0VVHvlNWqnn8Pk5IOfzBVpwyME0EzfVjMvYwQW-VgVNnFC96niKPTwiov54BvMb8QqgCci2nsQNct1RbBGL-Mrxa2dsdHQyuzMGBcGwPmeo1fUSOIaVvFTWP8GfGS7d8H0F8IHdDwVgwPiSuLqDgLVc6ZZe0C5bogWmZGsCnY/s4032/20230531_125958.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgmWTOrt2HObu0VVHvlNWqnn8Pk5IOfzBVpwyME0EzfVjMvYwQW-VgVNnFC96niKPTwiov54BvMb8QqgCci2nsQNct1RbBGL-Mrxa2dsdHQyuzMGBcGwPmeo1fUSOIaVvFTWP8GfGS7d8H0F8IHdDwVgwPiSuLqDgLVc6ZZe0C5bogWmZGsCnY/w180-h400/20230531_125958.jpg" width="180"></img></a></div><br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSs7L-PMCHWPSge4UpI5yuA1FxuP6WvXV-Ns_xYRaFCqxg_6YHMHA9nI66ZBl35xJdjzmvlqGESM_Ul-Yy_XBj7NhP-CZoMBLOT5FgQ4dDWQR7G6Ap46eGfmnd6gus8_3snC1kx5zByTonXAp8hCL0QgFhl8-QlRCWWaEz41T66NBUxLc_OXg/s4032/20230531_131047.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSs7L-PMCHWPSge4UpI5yuA1FxuP6WvXV-Ns_xYRaFCqxg_6YHMHA9nI66ZBl35xJdjzmvlqGESM_Ul-Yy_XBj7NhP-CZoMBLOT5FgQ4dDWQR7G6Ap46eGfmnd6gus8_3snC1kx5zByTonXAp8hCL0QgFhl8-QlRCWWaEz41T66NBUxLc_OXg/w180-h400/20230531_131047.jpg" width="180"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiQtsdFlfUIA1GuOKfbYSDIM5e-h3Gaq7r6EQNfdPr0j3iWh3GgX5qUYdrYZbARqI0FWr7Wc87_nuhJtfvRuoLSEWsif0yjNpeVjqA_NTq09VuDUmBaHRyewVIgl5FlszhuNra3jBJi7XNWxXeF7xhpBz_MgGB1-R5Czrqrh4bKuc2AfFFn7HQ/s4032/20230531_131317.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiQtsdFlfUIA1GuOKfbYSDIM5e-h3Gaq7r6EQNfdPr0j3iWh3GgX5qUYdrYZbARqI0FWr7Wc87_nuhJtfvRuoLSEWsif0yjNpeVjqA_NTq09VuDUmBaHRyewVIgl5FlszhuNra3jBJi7XNWxXeF7xhpBz_MgGB1-R5Czrqrh4bKuc2AfFFn7HQ/w400-h180/20230531_131317.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Fun moments.

So we never really got to try good local cuisine in Kosovo.  </div><div> </div><div>By then our visit to Pristina was over and we took a taxi back to our apartment. That's when I began taking a better look at our route to Podgorica in Montenegro the next day. I realised it would be very mountainous terrain and finally found out the only way to go was by returning to Albania and through Shkoder which is motorway for most of the way.  Google Maps wanted us to go the old way, via the tiny mountain pass border of Rozhaja. Thank God I asked.  Otherwise we would have been in for another really scary drive.</div><div> </div><div>We left really early for us, at 7.30 and were soon on a familiar road to Albania, the same road we had taken to Kosovo. It is excellent until you get to Shkoder where the motorway ends but no worries as the surface of the road itself was fine. It seemed an age until we arrived at the border of Montenegro - just 25km or so to the capital, Montenegro. This is it! Another border, another country. We had passed another border earlier from Kosovo into Albania but it as about as quick as paying a motorway toll, incredible! I had to record the moment of us entering yet another country; Montenegro, not one I knew much about I'm afraid. </div><div> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxTmhtJA4VfWJLZkhMtXyvZuJAQ98sgcMaGGQbvgRdkQeyBqDqeQsv8nbh-xoriQFP6jg1ObDpX-Jb_l4eH0-kMYICRdcc2M7Btjc4I7OKVWHIwJvHhUUvfF_kBj8hAiP-4to8_xAaQuBH-ppoW2h6lV1r5_ubQ5B7jisxORqDb_D3TKVKDVo/s4032/20230601_124339.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxTmhtJA4VfWJLZkhMtXyvZuJAQ98sgcMaGGQbvgRdkQeyBqDqeQsv8nbh-xoriQFP6jg1ObDpX-Jb_l4eH0-kMYICRdcc2M7Btjc4I7OKVWHIwJvHhUUvfF_kBj8hAiP-4to8_xAaQuBH-ppoW2h6lV1r5_ubQ5B7jisxORqDb_D3TKVKDVo/w400-h180/20230601_124339.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">As usual I took a video which you can see on my YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P1ly0KUpDQ">here</a>. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">We were at our new home - an apartment I had reserved on <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/me/dolce-apartman.en-gb.html?aid=964694&amp;app_hotel_id=9924539&amp;checkin=2023-06-01&amp;checkout=2023-06-02&amp;from_sn=android&amp;group_adults=2&amp;group_children=0&amp;label=Share-9lUbLQ%401685464002&amp;no_rooms=1&amp;req_adults=2&amp;req_children=0&amp;room1=A%2CA">Booking</a> very shortly but as I didn't have a local Sim card I had to go and find a bar with wifi to contact Luka, my host. He turned up very quickly and impressed me first with his height - way over 6ft and his English which is excellent. His flat is on the top floor of an old building near the centre and as we have found in many of the Balkan countries, it doesn't have a lift. Our flat was on the top floor but dear Luka helped us with our luggage both when we arrived and when we departed. We loved the flat which felt like home immediately. It was hot when we arrived, one of our few warm days so we changed into summer clothes and were soon outside again; this time in search of food.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">Luka recommended a place nearby called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/radovce.podgorica/">Radovce</a> where we had a splendid meal of local fare - a bit heavy as Balkan food is but quite tasty.

Not that we knew much about it or the country. The name "Montenegro" puzzled me. It's Spanish meaning "black mountain". So why I wondered? Well, the name in the local language is "Crna Gora" which means the same but apparently the Slavic name was difficult in English so a popular Latin name became the official name. I also heard it comes from the Venetian when the area was governed by Venice. Who knows? As to the language it is a branch of Serbo Croat and amazingly uses both the Cyrillic and Roman alpahabets</div><div><br></br></div><div>It didn't help not having internet or Google Maps to know where to go but I had read up which were the main sights. There are not many as Podgorica is more a town than a city, with only 136,000 inhabitants. It's a tiny country with a total population of just over 600.000 people. The Balcanisation of Yugoslavia made lots of little countries. Montenegro, historically tied to Serbia, broke away, after the Balkan Wars too, but only in 2006, 2 years before Kosovo. It borders with Bosnia Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo (impossible border high up in the mountains) and Albania. It is mostly Orthodox but about 20% of the population is Muslim. Most of the old part of the city of Podgorica was bombed during WW2 and not much is left of its heritage, which, like most of the Balkans, comes from the  Ottoman Empire. Thus there is a Clock Tower which was used like a Minaret and 2 old Mosques. We saw them in what is known as Stara Varos - old town. The clock tower seems to be the main symbol of the city. This is it. <br></br><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiNgl-rvS9L7H5tRjW-UxIE9lyZAnDXOPVCgBR8vFd2QSAuq2h24g4J4WwhTcpPDAOUH4JHxb2KgjXQT7Sk3yNs0WqE43m1nGE2_Pd5HElGM6Ce08_MEgknbLYSoemjQg7yu4snaKxHGQel9OpI0-N_V5Mfemm6U5HjcCkz9KwP67ta-HrH4uk/s4032/20230601_161532.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiNgl-rvS9L7H5tRjW-UxIE9lyZAnDXOPVCgBR8vFd2QSAuq2h24g4J4WwhTcpPDAOUH4JHxb2KgjXQT7Sk3yNs0WqE43m1nGE2_Pd5HElGM6Ce08_MEgknbLYSoemjQg7yu4snaKxHGQel9OpI0-N_V5Mfemm6U5HjcCkz9KwP67ta-HrH4uk/w180-h400/20230601_161532.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Clock tower in Podgorica</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Another symbol is the "Old Ribnica River Bridge" which took some finding.

It was apparently built in Roman times but was reconstructed in the 18th century by Adzi Pasa a prominent citizen of the city who also built one of the mosques. He must have been rich. We thought it was lovely and it was so hot that honestly I was very tempted to go in the water but my husband warned me of the currents because of the two rivers meeting. He was right.

From Podgorica to Dubrovnik it is only 150km but takes 3.5 hours and you go through Bosnia so I was happy to be able to have internet coverage all the way. The journey was pleasant on a single road and with gorgeous scenery in Montenegro, Bosnia and Croatia. It made me want to come back and spend more time in the area. We stopped at one point in Montenegro to take a picture of a lake to share with you. </div><br></br><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcnOwq0kkws_zKlsT3kFEL0DIGRwwU1oKhXCsxcg6kvnkoAp0Rio4Fqn8GUe70wW7kp0rI36h-uRmOkqNXlG7A4GWPrtJN87VXIIOX-X5VVaBpVkS9_0fk0Dmg8PcUKAEGwj0K8lDu6dZtw-gDWEUodrjn5HV57stvSZ6FpgmlVATyaknEMls/s4032/20230602_092941.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcnOwq0kkws_zKlsT3kFEL0DIGRwwU1oKhXCsxcg6kvnkoAp0Rio4Fqn8GUe70wW7kp0rI36h-uRmOkqNXlG7A4GWPrtJN87VXIIOX-X5VVaBpVkS9_0fk0Dmg8PcUKAEGwj0K8lDu6dZtw-gDWEUodrjn5HV57stvSZ6FpgmlVATyaknEMls/w400-h180/20230602_092941.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Beautiful scenery in Montenegro on our way to Dubrovnik</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We crossed two borders that day, one with Bosnia and one with Croatia.

Maja, a local Croatian girl, was our guide and she was excellent. Here is Eladio at the start of the tour in Luza square where Maja gave us a short run down of the history of the city. It was once ruled by Venice, then became the Republic of Dubrovnik, then passed into the hands of the Austro Hungarian Empire and finally the Ottoman Empire and of course, later, communism.  Like the rest of the Balkan states, it also broke free of Serbia with whom it has a difficult past - remember the massacre in Vukovar? That was in 1991 but its independence caused the Serbs to enter into war with its neighbour and even bomb beautiful Dubrovnik. Croatia is now a member of the EU (since 2012) and it is easy to see that it is the most prosperous country in the Balkans. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We walked with our guide from street to street, from square to square trying to take in all the places to see.

We continued our drive from Mostar to Sarajevo and went passed incredibly beautiful scenery. We were in the heart of the Dinaric Alps and following the wide Neretva River. I had never heard of the Dinaric Alps or the river. They are a mountain range separating the Balkan Peninsula from the Adriatic Sea and stretch from Italy in the north west through Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo to Albania in the south east. As the to the river Neretva it is one of the largest rivers in the Adriatic area that spans 225km of which 208 are in Bosnia. Both the mountains and the river made for spectacular views. It was one of the most beautiful drives of our trip if not the most beautiful.  We decided to stop for lunch at one of the numerous restaurants by the river. And here we are sitting on the terrace of the <a href="https://g.co/kgs/UJ8woq">Orahovica restaurant</a> in the town of the same name. I concluded just how beautiful Bosnia is from this wonderful panoramic drive <br></br><div><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEge24HbY1XbWAuPQlXHwoyCaCioJrW4t2PTAp8adRLYrn2_gmMQo8aJpx5lKxhVk5xmiAd30SPh6tHMYERVXrG6qFeQ3oCdW0YhDkjOso0ZwE3a1O3nxSKWpyGiujP4AhoN1E0YJQKkhxFUoll_BndcUVoQ9oTSj139xBgQg9JqPSLaL2WqBVM/s4032/20230603_132258.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEge24HbY1XbWAuPQlXHwoyCaCioJrW4t2PTAp8adRLYrn2_gmMQo8aJpx5lKxhVk5xmiAd30SPh6tHMYERVXrG6qFeQ3oCdW0YhDkjOso0ZwE3a1O3nxSKWpyGiujP4AhoN1E0YJQKkhxFUoll_BndcUVoQ9oTSj139xBgQg9JqPSLaL2WqBVM/w400-h180/20230603_132258.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjIwwLjJhldcSTeMrWVxUdQmkvqjROBXIbJJAxw63BaefxFH1DGiH71cq1LvNQcX7m6p1n27fP0Ds57lwF0I2uIO_Lh9vBoozBLICvLUbegfjtQ4CcwXzDImqzl5yzasNFScmOsKXYjJgwfLXZxLp1HOCVs5-M_FGABqU0uv8PyARRGFKFb9A0/s4032/20230603_141125.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjIwwLjJhldcSTeMrWVxUdQmkvqjROBXIbJJAxw63BaefxFH1DGiH71cq1LvNQcX7m6p1n27fP0Ds57lwF0I2uIO_Lh9vBoozBLICvLUbegfjtQ4CcwXzDImqzl5yzasNFScmOsKXYjJgwfLXZxLp1HOCVs5-M_FGABqU0uv8PyARRGFKFb9A0/w400-h180/20230603_141125.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Orahovica restaurant on the road from Mostar to Sarajevo</i></div><div>An hour and a half or so later we arrived in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia which is quite large with a population of over 200.000.  I somehow navigated the car to arrive at our new home - another self contained apartment I had found on Booking with a private car park and which is very near the heart of the old city - "stari grad".

Delma and her husband Amil were waiting for us and gave us a warm welcome. Nether speak English so we resorted to good old Google Translate. We soon moved into what would be our home for 2 nights. The place is not the best we have stayed at but it's clean and meets all my requirements (parking space, internet  -a bit patchy - a balcony and a kitchen - tiny). It was raining when we arrived in such contrast to sunny Dubrovnik and we decided to rest after settling in and also to have a short siesta. </div><div><br></br></div><div>From our window we could see the old Synagogue and various Ottoman buildings. Delma told me the "Latin Bridge" was 300 metres away. It is one of the most important landmarks of the city. I realised why very shortly that it was the scene of the crime of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand which famously led to the outbreak of WW1 in 1914. Wow, we were to meet a very important part of history face to face. I think that is what Sarajevo is most known for. So off we went in search of it and by now the rain had stopped. We found it shortly. It is one of many bridges crossing the River Miljaka which is very brown, unlike the green coloured River Neretza. This, my friends, is the Latin Bridge in all its glory, the place everyone flocks to when they arrive in the Bosnian capital. </div><div><br></br></div></div><div><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgIjez2PtF-GlqHGxkQgBoUC9bDBwJzTc4Rag1rjh0PPUCWEy3KF0lcP4tOBOsoJu0G4Rv4Rep16PUEXsg1aA0NV4rA0nGdudgDuogV6ar2DMRO6i5eidNIB9e7ygwOnR5tgGoNVkgs0WePVbok6OU2mOHUvuP3m2TB-pHFfdfykQdePuHbOBE/s4032/20230603_195726.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgIjez2PtF-GlqHGxkQgBoUC9bDBwJzTc4Rag1rjh0PPUCWEy3KF0lcP4tOBOsoJu0G4Rv4Rep16PUEXsg1aA0NV4rA0nGdudgDuogV6ar2DMRO6i5eidNIB9e7ygwOnR5tgGoNVkgs0WePVbok6OU2mOHUvuP3m2TB-pHFfdfykQdePuHbOBE/w400-h180/20230603_195726.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Latin Bridge in Sarajevo.</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><div>The name "Latin" comes because it connected the right bank of the river with the Catholic quarter of the city which used to be called "Latinluk" in Ottoman times.

All in all we had had a tiring but wonderful day.</div><div><br></br></div><div>And today is Sunday and at 10.30 we are joining another "Guru Walking Tour" (in Spanish) and have to meet outside the old Ottoman City Hall.

We will come home to find Lucy our home help gone as she announced yesterday from Paris that she has found work in the French capital where she will live with one of her daughters. It came as an unpleasant surprise yesterday but thankfully before she left she brought a woman called Tana to replace her. It was supposed to be for the 4 days she was away but now I am realising she must have been planning this for some time. To be able to move to Paris she needed "papers" which she finally got at the beginning of May. It came as as shock as she has been with us for 4 years but of course she is free to go and thankfully she has found someone to replace her. </div><div><br></br></div><div>For now though I want to concentrate on enjoying Sarajevo and what is left of our trip. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Cheers then and thanks for following our road trip so faithfully.
