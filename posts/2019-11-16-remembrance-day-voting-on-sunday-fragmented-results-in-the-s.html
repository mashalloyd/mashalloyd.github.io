Hi again,</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Today is Elliot's month day if that term exists in English. He is two months old today and we are celebrating. These two months with him have brought nothing but joy for all of us and it is marvelous to see him grow. He is now a very long baby measuring 60 cm and weighing just over 5 kilos. And he is just so cute although at night he is a bit of a devil as the poor mite suffers on and off from colic. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Last Sunday he came to visit. Sunday was Remembrance or Armistice Day as it used to be known. It was first observed in 1919 to remember those who fell in the Great War otherwise known as World War 1. I think it is fitting that I remember too. While  writing my father's biography I came across photos of my grandfather, my father's father, Revd. John Collins Lloyd who was a chaplain in WW1. Here he is in his uniform.<br></br>

I also learned that my father's uncle, Harold Benson, the husband of his mother's sister, Gwendoline, was also in WW1. Sadly a few years later he died of wounds from the war. Here he is too in his uniform.<br></br>

And finally here is a photo of my father in his WW2 navy uniform which no doubt you have seen many times. We should remember especially now that there are not many veterans left, my father being one of them. Soon there will be none left.<br></br>

If in England Remembrance weekend was being celebrated, in Spain its fourth general election in so many years was taking place.  We went to vote with Oli and Miguel who brought little Elliot with them wrapped up warmly for a cold November day. Miguel had voted by post as his home is officially Valencia and I of course cannot vote which is very frustrating. So all I could do was watch my husband and daughter vote; for two different candidates by the way as democracy dictates and which is a good thing. Here they are voting together.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Later as tradition dictates in our family we went to have a coffee together. Both Miguel and I indulged in a "porra" (sort of thick churro) even though it was already 1 pm and only an hour to lunch.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
We all had lunch together at home to my father's joy. He loves it when Elliot comes and so do we. The little tot was asleep throughout lunch allowing his mother to eat with two hands hahaha. We offered to have him during our siesta and up he went in his pram to be laid by my side of the bed. Here he is asleep in our room.</div>

He slept for a while until about 40 minutes later he began to wake up and started to cry. I had hoped to give Oli and Miguel time to catch up on their much needed sleep but it was not to be. </div>

Sunday was a guest free day after Manuel and Gelia, our Catalán guests, had left in a rush to get back to Barcelona to vote. It was on Sunday that I gathered together old photos of my dear friend Fátima for the Motorola colleague dinner being especially organised for her. I had told some of our old colleagues how ill she was and that rallied them to the cause wanting to pay homage to her in a special dinner. Vicente would organise it and suggested making a special album;   a book of photos to present to her. I found quite a few, nearly all related to our Motorola cycling days. That's when our friendship was forged. It happened during the first cycling event we went to together in Catalonia where we stayed at the Parador in Cardona - unforgettable. We had so much fun during those days as you can see in one of the photos below. It was taken during the Vuelta a España (Tour of Spain) in 1995, 24 years ago! We were in our 30's then and looking good don't you think?</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Looking at that photo now I can hardly believe that was us. We were so young! What wonderful memories.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Sunday was all about the general election and by 8 pm, just as the polling stations closed, Eladio and I were having dinner in the kitchen and beginning to watch a special programme on the results which began to come in about an hour or so later. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
We watched the rest of it from bed. I was brought up at home on watching election results which of course never came in until the next day when I was young and living in Yorkshire. Both my parents considered those nights as very special and they were almost like a party. Politics was important in our house. My parents were staunch conservatives and my brother was staunch labour much to their disapproval. I went along with them and when I could vote, also voted conservative. I wouldn't vote conservative today. Sadly I can no longer vote in the UK because of the stupid rule that doesn't allow you to  if you have lived outside the country for more than 15 years. As I have told you before I can't vote here in Spain either unless I have Spanish citizenship so I am in voting limbo although very interested in politics just as my husband is and Olivia. Suzy doesn't give a damn really especially now that she is far away in Bali. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
So we watched as the first results came in and from the very start it was clear what the outcome would be with even more fragmentation than in April. By midnight we knew for sure the incumbent caretaker left wing PSOE party had won with 120 seats (3 down from last time) but is far from having a majority. There are 350 seats in the lower house (Congress) and 176 are needed to govern. Their natural partners, the far left party Podemos got 35 (7 down) which means that if they are to be allies they will need the votes of the independence parties. The big surprise of the night was the increase in seats of the far right party Vox and the sinking of the central party Citizens (Ciudadanos) from 47 to 10. If you divide these parties into right wing and left wing blocks, the right wing block now has 150 and the left wing block has 158 approximately. So deadlock and stalemate again. One solution would be the allying of the two main parties, PSOE and PP (right wing) which would give a government an overall majority of 208 seats. Easy peasy you would think. That would keep away the far right party VOX and keep in check all claims for independence in Catalonia. However it is easier to see on paper than in reality as there are maybe too many differences between these two historic parties. </div>

Forming a government is going to prove very difficult and will take quite a long time. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Monday came and brought news of the outcome of the elections with lots of speculation on possible pacts or coalitions between the parties as the maths just don't add up. The biggest news of the day was the resignation of the leader and founder of the Ciudadanos Party, Albert Rivera after losing so many seats, down from over 50 to just 10. I felt sorry for him as I had been up until a while ago quite a fan of his. However, he is the victim of his own mistakes. Had he backed the PSOE party last April we would have had a stable government by now and he would have had a big say in the running of the country. I wonder while he is licking his wounds he is thinking about how he made the completely wrong decision.<br></br>
<br></br>
Life continued normally for us at home. It was very cold so we postponed our walk until midday when we could enjoy the few rays of sunshine of the day. In the evening Eladio and I went out to see the doctor to get a prescription for our flu jabs which my husband would later inject on both of us. You see he is not only my husband but many other things too, including my doctor hahaha.<br></br>
<br></br>
We came home to prepare for Oli and Elliot's arrival. Elliot was coming to stay for four nights as Miguel went back to work this week. He still has a month left from his holiday quota but will use that time later on. Oli drove to our house with Elliot screaming in his baby seat all the way and she arrived very flustered. We soon helped  to calm the little tot down. He was having a very fretful day probably due to colic. He calmed down enough for his mother to be able to eat with one hand. She had brought the most delicious "ibérico" ham which we all wolfed down.<br></br>
<br></br>
We were all in bed by about 10 pm and I hoped Oli and little Elliot would have a reasonable night, the first without his father. That night Eladio and I finished watching "Hache" which we can highly recommend.<br></br>
<br></br>
We didn't have long to see the first political negotiation coming to fruition and it brought with it a pact with the devil, a pact between the socialist winning party with the communist leader of Spain's extreme far left party, Podemos. I, like most of the country, couldn't believe it. The socialist leader, Pedro Sánchez had negotiated before with Iglesias and at the last moment their pact after the April elections was abandoned with Sánchez saying he wouldn't be able to sleep at night in a coalition government with Iglesias. Well it seems now he can as on Tuesday the two ego centrical political animals who see more in this for their own political gain than for the country, sealed a pact with a hug. The hug is a sham as they do not see eye to eye. Between them they have 155 seats, 29 short of a majority. In all likelihood and despite Sanchez' promise not to gather support from the pro independence parties, he will again go against his word and use them.  If the pact goes through he will be in the hands of a communist and radical pro independence parties; not a good outlook for Spain. </div>

I dread to think how they will deal with the Catalán problem. That day anti system, ultra pro independence forces blocked the main motorway in Junkeras, the AP7 from Barcelona to France. It was the French gendarmes who broke them apart with force. I thought to myself it's ok if the Gendarmes bring force on them but if it had been the Spanish police, Spain would have been dubbed again as anti democratic and fascist. That's the reason why Pedro Sánchez doesn't dare be high handed in dealing with the violence we have seen. Why is that you may wonder? Well, because of international opinion. Spain will never be allowed to be free of its fascist roots from Franco's times, whatever it does, so any force from the police here is seen as fascist. Whereas, police all over the world would not be judged so. It's unfair as Franco died in 1975, Spain has a flourishing democracy but is still judged from its past. That makes my blood boil.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
What made me much happier that day was to hear that my childhood city, Bradford, that dark and ugly industrial city in the north of England which I am always a bit embarrassed to tell people that I  lived there, was named "The UK's most improved city". I had heard from some people that Bradford is undergoing some sort of revival which surprised me so I was delighted that people will now be hearing some good news from Bradford instead of bad. You can read all about it <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-50392377">here</a>. Below is its most beautiful landmark, the Town Hall. </div>

It is also, unsurprisingly, UK's top curry city. I well remember the very first curry house that opened in Bradford when I was a teenager, The Kashmir. I used to go with my brother George and I reckon we were some of the first British curry fans ever. He used to go for the Vindaloo and I used to go for the mildest dish, "korma". No cutlery was offered and we learned to eat curry with chapatis, something I still do today. I remember having to drink a whole jug of water they would place on the table every time we went. I also remember going along with some of my St. Joseph's College school 6th form friends and once, one of them, Jacky Mosley (daughter of the Coronation Street actor who played Alf Roberts), found a cockroach up her leg after our lunch at The Kashmir. The food was brilliant though and we didn't care about the cockroaches or that the curry house was right next door to the Bradford Morgue hahaha.</div>

Tuesday saw us on our walk in the morning in brilliant November sunshine. We came home to greet Oli having breakfast with little Elliot in Lucy's arms. He was fretful all day I'm afraid poor little mite. Eladio and I went to do the weekly food shopping - what an enormous amount of food we buy every week  - and I came home to help unload it and make our lunch. Luckily Elliot slept through lunch. He didn't sleep through his siesta with us though. Oli went to have her nails done and we were in charge. He had a few crying episodes in her absence and she came back, feeling guilty, to hear his screams. He spent the afternoon and evening almost permanently at her breast. But he has his quiet moments when I love bonding with him and talking and singing to him in English. That's when he seems like a little angel. Here he is in his pram in one of his quiet moments which of course is when we love him most hahaha.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The day did not end well. We were having a quiet dinner with Oli in the kitchen when I got a phone call from Indonesia not from Suzy's phone, but from her boyfriend's. I immediately thought the worst but she calmed me down telling me she was ok. She went on to explain there had been an accident in a bar. She had gone to get a beer and without knowing it there was  a fight going on between some Russian tourists. One of them hit her hard with his fist by mistake as the fist was aimed at someone else. She was hit hard, was nearly knocked out and needed four stitches in her head. Her friends took her to a clinic where she was cleaned up and seen to. The problem was her health insurance which I had to help her with. She couldn't ring them from her phone as the Indonesian sim card she uses doesn't allow international calls. Thus I did all the ringing and eventually managed to get the insurance company, Ocaso, in touch with Suzy on her Indonesian number. It was 4 in the morning there and the clinic wouldn't let her go until payment was made - quite a hefty payment too. In the end, they let her go but she had to leave behind her credit card and driving licence and it wasn't until the next day that Ocaso got in touch with the clinic. Suzy was quite shell shocked when she rang us and we were too. I wondered what she was doing so late out at night in probably a none too salubrious location. She gave us a shock.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Thus we were in bed very late. That night we started watching Season 2 of Jack Ryan on Netflix but I couldn't concentrate as I kept thinking of Suzy. At 4.30 am I was awake and texting her.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Wednesday came and there was a lot of rain. As soon as I had drunk my first nespresso - first things first - I was on the phone to the insurance company and to Suzy and a few hours later the former settled the clinic bill after ensuring it was on their list in that country.   I breathed a huge sigh of relief.<br></br>
<br></br>
 Eladio was up early too which is very unusual but that's because he was off to León that day to meet up with his brothers and sisters and sign some documents about our various houses in Montrondo which until now were all in his mother's name. He wouldn't be back until late that night.<br></br>
<br></br>
Thus the day was for the taking and Oli, Elliot and I had a grand time. In the mornings he is always at his brightest and very wide awake. While Oli went to have a shower I spent time entertaining him. I love my moments with him, singing and talking which he appears to love. He communicates with me with little sounds and lots of smiles like this one.<br></br>

It was a lovely sunny day and we took him and Pippa for a walk. He slept most of the way and all through lunch. In fact he slept a whole 2.5 hours, a record for him, allowing his mother to catch up on some sleep too. Later we gave him a bath. He is still not sure whether he likes his bath or not; typical of boys hahaha.<br></br>
<br></br>
That wasn't our only excursion that day. In the evening we went to visit Fátima for her to see little Elliot again. She was at home with her darling daughter also called Fátima and I know we cheered them up enormously with the arrival of Elliot. He behaved perfectly during the visit only needing a feed once and spent most of the time in my best friend's arms.<br></br>
<br></br>
At about 8 pm we left saying goodbye until the next day when the special ex Motorola dinner was to be held. We came home to get changed and make dinner before Eladio arrived home. He was back by about 9 pm and we had a nice private dinner in our huge dining room. Elliot was awake again by then and when we took him upstairs to bed, he was in a delightful mood and it was time for more talking and singing. This time Eladio joined me. Oli took this lovely photo of us playing with our 2 month old grandson who I assured her I now loved as much as I love my own daughters. She was a bit surprised but that is how it is. I told her she would know what I mean when she herself becomes a grandmother.<br></br>

We went to bed pretty late. Eladio soon fell asleep but I got caught up in a Hitchcock film with Grace Kelly and James Stewart called Rear Window.<br></br>
<br></br>
Thursday came and brought rain. I was up late that day, at 7.30. I was pretty astonished but pleased to have slept a bit more than usual.  Eladio and I managed our walk with the dogs when the rain had receded and even the sun came out. I got home feeling refreshed and happy with myself. Our walks are fundamental to our health both physical and spiritual.<br></br>
<br></br>
After leaving lunch sorted, I accompanied Oli to the doctor for a check up  after having given birth. Of course we took Elliot along as wherever Oli goes, Elliot goes too.  He behaved very well for a small baby. Lunch was late but wonderful - coq au vin, etc - and then soon it was time to go out again, this time to take Elliot for his check up and first vaccines. The poor little thing did not know what he was in for. The nurse was amazed at his progress in weight and height, size of his head, his strength etc for such a young baby. That we were happy to hear, but didn't like it when she "pricked" him on both legs. The poor little boy yelled in pain. We had to wait outside for 10 minutes to make sure there was no negative reaction and there we could calm him down. We came home for him to be breastfed again, changed and bathed. He is beginning to like his baths.  And here he is all warm and clean afterwards propped up on Oli's breastfeeding pillow looking like a little cherub.<br></br>

He had a long and stressful day. Luckily there was no bad reaction to the vaccines and he slept well that night.<br></br>
<br></br>
My night was just beginning after I had helped Oli bathe him. I had to get ready to go out to pick up my dear friend Fátima and take her to the ex Motorola dinner. It's sad to see how each day she seems  a little weaker and has more pain. But that night she made  a supreme effort and was looking gorgeous when her daughter brought her up the steep ramp from her garage. The two of us went off as if it was just another corporate event we were going to. When we worked together at both Motorola and Nokia we went to many. This one was to be a very special one, one of our last together, something both of us were very aware of. Fátima, like Maria in The Sound of Music is "late for every meal" and is not known for her punctuality. Thus I had told her to be ready by 8 but really the dinner wasn't starting until 8.30. Amazingly we were nearly the first ones to arrive.<br></br>
<br></br>
Soon our old colleagues and friends began to arrive one by one and very soon we were a group of some of our closest colleagues, 20 people. Everyone had responded affirmatively, no one wanted to miss this most special occasion. We began working at Motorola 29 years ago when mobile phones hadn't even really taken off. It was difficult to explain our jobs at the beginning. I used to have to tell people that we made cordless phones but ones you could take with you. People replied, "oh you mean a pager?". Little did we know at the time how popular they would become. I remember using text messages for the first time when one of our technicians, Alex Good, showed me how. I thought it was very cumbersome and told him I thought it would never take off. How wrong I was. We made an extraordinary team who together, made mobile phones popular in Spain. We also made extraordinary friends, so much so that the bond still exists today. Time has passed but our friendship remains and that night everyone wanted to be there to pay homage to one of our team, to my dear friend Motorola. I have that American mobile phone company to thank for my deep friendship with Fátima.<br></br>
<br></br>
We were so excited to be together again, we had to have a group photo as soon as we arrived and this is one of them. I love it. We were in our 20's and 30's then and now we are in our 50's and 60's, looking older of course but still a group of colleagues who are also friends who are bound together forever. I call us "the Motorola family" because that is what we are.<br></br>

Fátima was overjoyed and so was I. A lot of people told me they had come expecting a sad night but that it had been joyful and that was because of Fátima and her amazing positive attitude. There were not enough hours in the night to talk to everyone and to eat too. The food, although superb, was the least important thing that night. We had all sent photos to Vicente who organised the dinner - round of applause Vicente - and Susana had made up a beautiful album of photos from our past for us all to write in and give to Fátima. She would later read everyone's messages with joy. Towards the end of the dinner, my dear friend, got up to give a short speech. With tears in her eyes she gave thanks for a wonderful life and said that her Motorola days had been the happiest in her working life and that she would carry everyone in her heart. I think we all cried - well I did. Here she is, with great courage, making that beautiful speech.<br></br>

All good things come to an end. It was getting late and time to disband but it took ages to say goodbye to everyone. I had had an emotional night, not just because of Fátima but also because two of my ex colleagues had very sad stories to tell that was news for me.<br></br>
<br></br>
But I drove Fátima home feeling happy for being part of a beautiful event made possible by our ex Motorola colleagues who had made her night so special. Thanks everyone, especially Alex for having the idea, Vicente for organising everything, Susana for making the album and thanks too to everyone for coming.<br></br>
<br></br>
After leaving Fátima at her house, I drove home and I think it must have been past 2 when I got into bed - pretty late for me. It took me a long time to fall asleep.<br></br>
<br></br>
Friday came and brought sunshine. I had breakfast late for once and was delighted when Oli and Elliot came down to the kitchen early. I love to see my little grandson first thing in the morning when he is so awake and smiley. </div>

Oli and Elliot joined us on our walk that day pushing her baby in his state of the art pram. When I was first a mother I used a very old hand me down pram, nothing like what Oli and Miguel have for little Elliot. It was to be Eladio's first walk with his grandson. Here they are wrapped up on our walk on Friday morning.</div>

For once I didn't have to make lunch that day. Oli was going out to have lunch to meet her childhood school friend, Paula, from St. Michael's school and who had just had her second baby and I was going out to lunch with Fátima again, this time with two Nokia girl friends; Paloma and Mari Angeles. Thus, after changing little Elliot, we both got ready to go out. I chose to wear my trusted red Brussels woolen dress with a tartan red coat which I haven't worn much but which I love. Here I am just before I went out.</div>

My father and husband would have lunch alone and it would be leftovers; bean stew which I had made a few days ago. My lunch would be much more appetising hahahaha.</div>

I went to pick up Fátima who came out of her flat via the garage ramp aided by her sweet daughter. She saw us off as if she was the mother and we the children.  When she was very young I would go and pick up my friend to go to a corporate event of some kind and little Fátima would protest at her mother leaving. On Friday she sent us off telling us to have a good time. How the tables have turned I said to my friend. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
We didn't have to drive very far to the restaurant, La Tagliatella, where we were met by dear Paloma outside. Paloma has been at Nokia for 20 years and was my boss Felix' secretary when we first met. She was then aged 26 so I could hardly believe it when she told me she is now 45! She married two years ago and now has a 7 month old baby. I told her if she could have a baby at 44 there was hope yet for my daughter Suzy who is 10 years younger than her hahahaha. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
I was to meet Mari Angeles for the second time, one of Fátima's best friends after I left Nokia in 2005 - wow 14 years since I left that wonderful Finnish company. It was a chin wag lunch which lasted until way past 5 pm. In fact I think we were the last diners to leave. Before we left we had to have a photo taken.

We also agreed to organise a similar dinner to the Motorola one but with ex and non ex Nokia colleagues. Fátima was delighted at the idea and we fixed the date for next week. We will all look forward to that. </div>

I drove Fátima home and then came home myself and rushed upstairs to see Oli and little Elliot who had come back from their lunch in Majadahonda. Oli had sent me a photo of her and Paula and their babies which I must share here.</div>

It was curious to see both girls together, now grown ups and with their own babies when it seems like yesterday that I would drive Oli to Paula's house to see her friend when they were just children. Where has the time gone I asked myself?</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Well, on the topic of time, I had some quality time with Oli and her baby when I got back from my lunch until her partner, Miguel, arrived back from Valencia after a short week back at work. He was delighted to see them. I was curious to see who he would kiss first and, unsurprisingly, it was Elliot hahaha. Oli and I made dinner although I wasn't at all hungry and we had a nice meal together in our big dining room surrounded by our dogs. Little Elliot had a bit of a crying spell and so it was up to Eladio to calm him down. He did it the usual way but when the baby started crying again he used new tactics which seemed to work. Oli and I cracked up watching Eladio carrying his grandson high up and pacing around the room. At least it helped to settle the baby hahaha.</div>

We went to bed a bit late and watched some more of season two of Jack Ryan on Amazon Prime which neither of us has got into. I think we shall not be watching any more of it.</div>

Saturday came and it was another dry and sunny day.  In Montrondo, our village, however, there had been the biggest snowfall for a long time. We were planning to go tomorrow but it seems that the electricity is down. I'm keeping my fingers crossed it's restored as if there is no central heating, no warm water, no internet connection, we just can't go, especially if we are taking little Elliot. This is just one of the photos Javi, the youngest inhabitant, took of the beautiful scenery created in the village. It looks like the snow is 1 metre or so high. That's an awful lot.  If you saw this photo and didn't know where it was taken, no doubt you would guess it was in Switzerland but no, it is  in Montrondo high up in the mountains in north west Spain.<br></br>

As usual we went on our walk and it was beautiful with the sun. I had to take off two layers of clothing believe it or not. I came home to find our latest guest, Carmen, had already left and Lucy was preparing the rooms for our new guests who would be arriving that day. Communication was not too good and I spent the day waiting for them and they did not turn up till past 9 pm when I was already in bed. They are a couple from Almeria who came with their 7 and 1 year old children. They will be leaving today at noon and then we will have the house to ourselves again for the moment.<br></br>
<br></br>
Saturday was a quiet day for us with not much to tell. On the news front, disturbances carried on in Bolivia after Evo Morales was forced to flee to Mexico. He says there was a coup but it's not clear.<br></br>
What is clear is that after 14 years in government, elections were held and there are accusations the results were rigged. When he came to power it was quite something for a native Indian to do so but passing a law to make presidency almost perpetual is not in my mind very democratic. In Chile too and in Hong Kong the disturbances continued as they did in Barcelona. Yesterday the CDR (ultra independent seekers) tried to barricade the train stations but thankfully were thwarted. One of the reasons I do not like the new "pact with the devil" is the need for support from the independence parties. I think this pact is not popular and we have yet to see if it will work out.<br></br>
<br></br>
On a much happier note, Oli and Miguel enjoyed their time together this weekend with little Elliot who turns 2 months today. Wow 2 months! How fast time flies. Here is a lovely photo of mother and child taken by Miguel yesterday where both of them are smiling.<br></br>

He is quite clearly playing in it and smiling as you can see in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/edit?video_id=GB8HDDZzs4M&amp;video_referrer=watch">video</a>. Oli remarked that while she is talking to him he is responding and I think it's true. He seems to be a very alert baby for his age.<br></br>
<br></br>
We watched the news that night and then a political debate and fell asleep quite early. I was up this morning at 7 am. Over my cup of coffee I had a phone call with Suzy who is in Ubud today. She was happy to tell me she has found a new house to rent and has also bought a scooter. Good for her. Talking to Suzy was a lovely start to today.<br></br>
