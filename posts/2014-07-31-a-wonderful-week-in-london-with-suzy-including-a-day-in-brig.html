<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Hi everyone,</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Well here I am
a bit late with my blog but that’s because I’ve just been away for a week to
London to stay with Suzy and Gábor.  Suzy
and I came back yesterday which means we are all together again.  Tomorrow Eladio, Suzy, Oli, Miguel and I will
be off to Montrondo for the annual family gathering so today is the perfect day
to catch up with my blog and to tell you all about my fabulous week in London
with Suzy. <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I left off
last Tuesday when we had just come back from a wonderful few days with Sandra,
Jeffer and Isaline in Santa Pola.  I had
just one afternoon to settle in and get ready to go again.  When we got back the greengage tree was
heaving with fruit and Eladio picked as much as he could with his super
homemade method and I packed some to take to Suzy and Gábor.  We just managed to see Olivia before I was
off and had a nice dinner together.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">And the next
day was Wednesday, the day of my much awaited trip to London.  Eladio took me to the airport to catch the
11.35 Easy Jet flight to Gatwick. All went smoothly until I switched my phone
back on again upon arrival.  It asked for
my pin code which I had simply forgotten. 
Thus I was not able to contact Suzy to say I had landed and was worried
she wouldn’t be at Victoria waiting for me to arrive on the Gatwick
Express.  Luckily she was and we had a
huge hug; a great start to our week together. We made our way to Canada Water (south
east London, one stop from Canary Warf and a couple of stops to Westminster) by
tube and dear Suzy helped me with my luggage. 
I particularly liked the walk from the tube station to their house
through lovely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_Dock_Woodland">Russia Dock Woodlands</a>. Soon we were at her house having a cup
of tea and then I got Eladio to ring Yoigo to find out my pin number.  I was so relieved to have my phone up and
running again.  I mean, can you imagine
me without my mobile? When Gábor got back he commented that I had quickly set
up my little Yoigo office with my pc and he was right.  Their wifi came in handy in order to avoid using
data whilst roaming which can be expensive.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I was
delighted with their new house.  They
practically have the whole ground floor to themselves and their nice big room
has its own garden giving them a feeling of space.  Upstairs is more cramped. Thanks to their
friend and flat mate, Stefania who was away on holiday in Italy, I had a room
to myself upstairs which was comfortable enough but very warm due to the heat
wave in London.  Thankfully it had air
conditioning. What a luxury.  Their other
flat mates are an Italian girl, Luana, who occupies a miniscule room and a guy
from Singapore who occupies the other double room and whom we hardly saw as he
gets up at the crack of dawn and returns late, never eating at home. The only
drawback is that there is only one bathroom to be shared by all.  Otherwise the house is very pleasant, light,
new and with wooden floors.  The big well
equipped kitchen was probably my favourite room.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The first
thing we did was to walk to Tesco very near the tube station to do some
shopping mainly for breakfast.  We were
joined there by Gábor who brought Suzy’s bike to carry the shopping back.  It is a huge Tesco and serves probably ever
nationality in the area.  There was a
incredible display of food for the end of Ramadan festival and a huge halal
meat counter, not to mention all the rest, wonderful cooked food, superb bread
and anything or everything you could ever imagine. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">That night I
treated Gábor and Suzy to dinner out and we went to one of my favourite
restaurants in London, a Turkish place called </span><a href="http://www.thegrandbazaar.co.uk/" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The Grand Bazaar</a><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> at the end of Marylebone
High Street.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We caught the train to
Baker Street and walked there as we would on the way back.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">My idea in London was to walk as much as
possible to make my wearable device, my fitbit, as happy as possible. Suzy you
might be interested to know, turned vegetarian a few weeks ago after watching a
documentary about how the human race treats animals and fish for
consumption.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">She was so put off she just
doesn’t want to be a part of it.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">She has
asked Olivia and me to watch it but I’m afraid I’m far too much a lover of meat
and fish, to a lesser extent, I would prefer not to watch it.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">At the Grand Bazaar there were plenty of
veggy options as there are all over London; not so much in Spain, so we all
enjoyed a “mezze” together along with the spectacular balloon shaped bread.</span></div>

woke up at 7, thinking it was 8 as I was still on Spanish time.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Thus I went down to the kitchen to make a cup
of coffee and catch up with my work before Suzy and Gábor got up to join me for
breakfast.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We made lovely breakfasts

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">As soon as I
got to Suzy’s house I agreed on a programme with Suzy.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  The idea was to do different things, i.e. not going to the usual monuments which I have seen countless times.  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I think in the end, even though I have so much energy I
even tired myself, not to mention tiring Suzy. Anyway, the first day we had agreed to go shopping: you see
where my priorities lie, and Suzy took me to</span><a href="http://uk.westfield.com/stratfordcity/?gclid=CjwKEAjwgMieBRCB3bqB94e9lD4SJABW3sTNmUMVi0UeHzFyMnWnthoQvgfAoP9Td0Cp9TvZBzD8NRoCvW3w_wcB" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> Westfield Shopping Centre</a><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> in
Stratford, just 2 stops from Canada Water.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I loved the walk from her house to the tube station through Russia Dock
Woodlands.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I wasn’t really sure where I
was in London so googled the famous London docks.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">All I remembered as a child was the famous
dockers’ strike there and didn’t really know what had happened since.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The docklands, I found out from a passerby on
Stave Hill who works in Parliament for an MP, were closed down in the late 60’s
as they couldn’t take the new freight ships which now ship from other big ports
but at the time the London Docks were the biggest in the world.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Russia Docks takes its name from being the
dock where timber was shipped from Russia and Scandinavia.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In actual fact they are part of the Surrey
Commercial Docs, a large group of docks in Rotherhite on the south bank of the
Thames in South East London.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The docks
operated from 1696 to 1969.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Most were
later filled in a redevelopment for residential housing and the area is now
known as Surrey Quays. They have done a wonderful job as the residential
housing is surrounded by beautiful woodland.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In fact one night we saw a stray fox walk right across our path. Today the
area is quite trendy and a far cry from Whitechapel, otherwise known as “Bangladesh
City” where Suzy and Gábor used to live.</span></div>

surprised to hear that the first shop we went to was Marks and Spencer.  Here I bought some new denim jeggings to
replace the pair I had torn when I fell recently.  I also got a pair each for my sisters-in-law
Pili and Adela.  Next were polo shirts
for Eladio and a summer shirt for my Father. 
Later we went to H+M to buy clothes for Suzy after which it was time for
lunch. We chose a nice English place called <a href="http://www.bumpkinuk.com/restaurants/westfield/private-dining/">Bumpkin</a> where I had, guess
what?  Yes, you are right, fish and
chips.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

seen since I was a child when Aunty Gloria took us there.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The visit would bring back many happy
memories which I wanted to share with Suzy. Gábor would be working everyday so
he was only able to join us for breakfast and dinner but would be accompanying
us the following Monday and Tuesday which is when he would get time off from
working at Decathlon.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We caught the

Saturday I woke up at 7 instead of 8. 
The programme for that day was afternoon tea at <a href="http://www.thewolseley.com/">The Wolseley</a> at 15.30 in
160 Piccadilly next to the Ritz, but first we went shopping to Tesco again.  We went to get food for dinner but also I
wanted to buy all sorts of chocolates and cakes to take home.  I knew my Father would love to eat things
like Mr. Kipling’s Bakewell Tart or Battenberg cake.  This time we walked and took Suzy’s
bike.  I decided to try it out and it did
feel very wobbly as I don’t think I’ve been on a bike for about 20 years.  Suzy was terrified I would fall and so was I
so I soon got off.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We decided to
tube it to Waterloo and walk to The Wolseley which was quite a way.  On our journey we stopped to go inside St.
Martin’s in the Fields built by Sr. Christopher Wren after the great fire of
London.  It was my Mother’s favourite
church in London when she lived after the war and I was keen to show it to
Suzy.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

say Suzy seems to know London like the back of her hand.  I was most impressed.  Brick Lane is famous for its curry houses and
I was looking forward to lunch there.  We

Brick Lane also has lots of street markets and we wandered around quite

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The next day
was Monday and the programme was a visit to Brighton, that very famous English
seaside town near London.  Gábor was to
join us and we would be hosted by our friends Keith and Lorraine who live
nearby in a pretty village called Cuckfield in West Sussex. Unfortunately the
forecast was for rain.  Whilst we were
boarding the train at London Bridge an almighty thunderstorm or freak storm hit
the town. However when we arrived the rain had just about stopped.  Later the sun came out and the rain only made
a very short reappearance in the afternoon when we were having a wonderful cup
of coffee. <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I have never
been to Brighton and didn’t really know what to expect. I imagined it was a
semi up market English seaside town but it is much more than that.  Of course it has some of the tackiness of
English seaside towns but I didn’t mind that as it brought back memories of
seaside holidays in England when I was a child to Scarborough, Whitby and other
places.  I learned that Brighton is now
the 22<sup>nd</sup> biggest town in England with a population of approximately
160.000.  It was made popular in the
eighteenth century by the patronage of the Prince Regent (later George IV)
after his first visit there in 1783. He of course built the wonderful Royal
Pavilion which we were to see later.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Our friends
took us down to the seafront and I was surprised to see the beach was made of
pebbles. Despite the rain and not so high temperatures there were plenty of
people on the beach.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

playing their piano. I was very impressed how well he plays, especially after
not having touched a piano since he left his native Canary Islands some two
years ago. We were joined for dinner by our hosts’ daughter Becky who was very
tired after a long day at work. I think it was great for both Suzy and Gábor to
be in an English home, probably the only one they have been to since they

Tuesday morning, my last day in London, we got up just a little bit later, or
at least I did as “the kids” didn’t join me for breakfast until 10 am.  That day we were to pick up my great friend
Sandra who was arriving from Brussels on the Eurostar at 16.45 at St. Pancras
International.  Thus we debated how to
spend the time on my last day.  In the
end we went to Chiswick hoping to have lunch at one of the pubs by the
river.  However when we got there and
asked how to get to the river, we were advised to go to Richmond instead which
apparently is far prettier. So that’s what we did but first we had to walk to
Gunnersby Station, get off at Richmond and walk all the way to the river.  It was very pretty but time was running out
and we were not served our lunch at The White Cross until after 3pm.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Sleeping
together in Suzy’s flatmate’s room was something of an adventure which had us
in stitches as if we were students again.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We managed to get some sleep until about 5 in the morning when the other
residents got up for their showers.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Then
suddenly water was falling on my pillow after I had switched the air
conditioning off.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Thus with many
interruptions during the night, we got up at 8 with just enough time to shower,
pack, have breakfast and leave. Gábor helped us to the bus stop and from there
we took the tube to Victoria.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We said
our goodbye to Sandra on the tube as she was making her way to her Mother’s
house in North London.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Once in Victoria,
a station which will forever signify international travel to me from when I was
a teenager going on inter rail across Europe, we caught the Gatwick
Express.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We were in a bit of a rush to
catch the 12.15 Easy Jet flight to Madrid but made it quite comfortably, with
time even to buy food for the plane at Pret a Manger which sells lovely
food.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The plane was very full.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I slept part of the way whilst Suzy was
worried about taking off and landing. Unfortunately we could not sit together
as we had not booked the tickets at the same time.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Once in Madrid the heat hit us, if it was
warm in London in Madrid it was literally boiling.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">But there was dear Eladio, my husband and
Suzy’s Father waiting for us at Terminal 1.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It was great to see him and to get into the air conditioned car and
drive to our lovely home.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It is always
great to go away but often even greater to come home.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">There is no place like home.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We greeted
everyone, unpacked and soon settled in. Both Suzy and I swam in the pool to
cool off.  Oli and Miguel were home at
about 7pm and it was great to see them. 
Both girls fell into each other’s arms which I loved witnessing. Later
some of their friends (Copi, Rocío, Pilar and Carolina) were coming round and
Suzy served Pimms which we had bought at Gatwick Airport (made with one third
Pimms, one third soda, one third lemonade, strawberries, cucumber and orange
pieces with lots of ice cubes. The only ingredient missing was fresh mint
leaves which were not available at Mercadona as there is no Pimms tradition in
Spain.  Later Suzy posted this selfie
with her friends. She was so happy, in her element surrounded by her friends
and at home in Madrid.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
