The main news is that the trial scheduled for 17th February has been postponed. That was a bit of a blow but we were determined not to let it affect us too much. After all we are not getting younger and we have to live our lives despite our unwanted squatter, Felipe Turover - can't stand the man. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So last<b> Sunday</b> we went on our walk in the morning to lift our spirits. Our walks are so important for both our bodies and our minds. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhxvMd9ZCQRn5Ud5mLc1K2VNSkh_TQs3_bB_EY8zpDpFCQMHrLVU4yRIoRpeIPDk7RwWuSmhSD9ZdQiD8b3trnuSQHefni2DJ2rQC_Vg5sWdAPZJe1L2-xFrC_geFqTg3Sty1c86CX7R0ILnpuuAvGHPqOWrxN_aYSSHXnFOu7vjeyDiPdd_Mc=s2946" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhxvMd9ZCQRn5Ud5mLc1K2VNSkh_TQs3_bB_EY8zpDpFCQMHrLVU4yRIoRpeIPDk7RwWuSmhSD9ZdQiD8b3trnuSQHefni2DJ2rQC_Vg5sWdAPZJe1L2-xFrC_geFqTg3Sty1c86CX7R0ILnpuuAvGHPqOWrxN_aYSSHXnFOu7vjeyDiPdd_Mc=w223-h400" width="223"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>On our walk last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">They are good for Pippa too, our constant companion. There aren't just two in our marriage, there are three as you will know. Our miniature chocolate dachshund so beloved by us, arrived 7 years ago this week and we could not envisage live without her. But we are all missing her canine sisters, Norah and Elsa our beagle and golden lab who passed away last year. They left a huge gaping hole in our lives. We miss them a lot on our walks as I am sure Pippa does too. </div><div style="text-align: justify;">We had a big lunch that day. I splurged on a shoulder and leg of lamb which we had with roast peppers. It is my favourite meat. I know meat is going out of fashion these days but then I don't always like to keep up with fashion hahahahaha. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We didn't see the children that day but were sent photos from Olivia. Here is one of the two little tots in Juliet's playpen and below is one of Elliot trying out his mother's trainers. He says they are his, not hers. He is nearly 2 and a half and is going through that phase where he thinks everything belongs to him hahahahah. I remember our girls when they were toddlers saying "mine, mine, mine". </div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhCXQtTCI0k2l76wHSO3tk3AKtJv7QpXWUth1IncPQNwGsAE2N2Bwyza3l9-GLQUwx6-rpK0KBZ3KFm3GlWItYMHVQQnZoLfj8saTgh8ikjW9Nnyjoam4g5vU053KJdWN9m3_AYi_wT043I05s1F_7GHYciQ0bMazbhUGYIt5bHC6CjPqhG3yA=s2016" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhCXQtTCI0k2l76wHSO3tk3AKtJv7QpXWUth1IncPQNwGsAE2N2Bwyza3l9-GLQUwx6-rpK0KBZ3KFm3GlWItYMHVQQnZoLfj8saTgh8ikjW9Nnyjoam4g5vU053KJdWN9m3_AYi_wT043I05s1F_7GHYciQ0bMazbhUGYIt5bHC6CjPqhG3yA=w225-h400" width="225"></img></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgF2jrx-tU2McdnvvpsgbGdMU1k_ST2pm0HBdTVs5C5RayusHt84cgxF2qyWHpkF6Q8yYWnSMqfyn7XIuSwp6ApZ1ubYts3Ej8VX6-rKLqn0_tcQtTCe1JVfLKNZGGfuOAxydqW3RtkeiYu8TN-OLKk2MhTrDVzOj3De0n2QEcFZxmF25rI_1c=s2016" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgF2jrx-tU2McdnvvpsgbGdMU1k_ST2pm0HBdTVs5C5RayusHt84cgxF2qyWHpkF6Q8yYWnSMqfyn7XIuSwp6ApZ1ubYts3Ej8VX6-rKLqn0_tcQtTCe1JVfLKNZGGfuOAxydqW3RtkeiYu8TN-OLKk2MhTrDVzOj3De0n2QEcFZxmF25rI_1c=w225-h400" width="225"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our grandchildren last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">I love receiving photos of Elliot and Juliet. They always brighten up my day. Often we talk about whether we shall move from this house and where shall we go. But we always come to the conclusion that it can't be far from them. For the moment our idea is to carry on living in this great big house for as long as we can. Then we shall see. If only this great big house was free of our horrible squatter. </div><div><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Monday</b> was St. Valentines Day. I'm no great fan of imported American traditions and it is only very recently that Eladio and I celebrate this day. These days though we need a reason for celebrating so we have succumbed to the day of love or of friendship as it is called in Finland. I had booked a table at La Txitxarrería (try saying that), one of our favourites so there was something to look forward to on a Monday night which is unusual.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Unusually too I had a doctor's appointment at the local health clinic - the public one. It was to get a new medical certificate as proof that the squatter situation was affecting my health in the hope that a judge would be sympathetic and issue an injunction. I went for nothing in a way as my Doctor must have forgotten. While there I had another kafkian moment. I wanted to update my health card with my new Spanish ID. For that the clinic had to go into the Social security data base. I wasn't surprised they had found me with my old residency card number. That had me panicking as not being on it would affect my retirement pension request - of course it would. So I rang my accountant Pilar - it's not really her job but she is very kind to me - and by the end of the day she had done the necessary paperwork or so I hoped. The thing is she has supposedly done it in December but something must have gone wrong. This change of identity is a nightmare, as bad as the process to get Spanish nationality. There is so much old fashioned bureaucracy, it's all online which is fine if you can navigate the page and nearly impossible to get a face to face appointment. Sorry for ranting but I really am sick and tired of Spanish bureaucracy. I don't know what it's like in the UK, France or Italy but I do know it cannot be worse than here. I had good news later as by Friday I was registered with the correct identity. Wow it had taken some time. Thanks Pilar. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">I spent the rest of the morning with Oli and Juliet but not on a nice mission. If only we had been out doing some clothes shopping. But, no we went to the courts in that God forsaken suburban town of Móstoles to the hostile courts again. We had to go to find out what was going on with our case. As we had suspected, FT had not got a pro bono lawyer on time and thus the hearing would have to be rescheduled. No one could give us a date but it won't happen for a least a month. Thus the eviction date will also be delayed probably until May. We were shocked too to be told that the judge had refused a preliminary precaution or injunction to chuck him out until the hearing. The judge doesn't have to put up with him breaking our windows or attacking our daughter. We do. Oh how I hate the justice system in this country. We also tried to get information on the proceedings of some of our reports - the vandalism to our home, false documents (bank slips) and attacking Olivia. All three were not added to the main cause and were yet to be assigned a court. That was so infuriating.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We spent about 2 hours in that soulless building where we only got bad news. We went to have a quick coffee before heading home. I suppose I should have felt furious, angry, frustrated but I just felt a bit numb. There is no other option now than to wait and wait we will. But I refuse now to be stressed. It is of no help. Something happened in that cafe worth mentioning as it made us laugh. We were talking in English and Oli was feeding Saint Juliet who hadn't cried all morning, when a black lady spoke to us in English from a few tables away. She is from Cameroon and spoke good English although I thought French was the main language there. Elizabeth told us she was a preacher and prophetess. Really? How incredible to find one in Móstoles don't you think?  She started to flatter us telling me I was beautiful, had lots of good energy, was a strong woman and should dedicate my life to God. She told Oli she was beautiful too and that she could see her being successful in England at some time. Elizabeth said any money problems I had would be gone by June.  </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjY4Qa3UWgM50WPamtm-t226ckaulJZx7oRNaSXiHjrJ5zCgVpD0_DKDxZ0EL6msKeA2-IXBBAVW0au63y-sduz61cKPr3CsgI_dCodvE9EHwj2CMZhZ0lBHmbHEzlLAYjAUWTJw9jqx7c_2MbmvPKwfAMVy2l6MEBjpYgUhCgPx65bCF0WrLY=s4032" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjY4Qa3UWgM50WPamtm-t226ckaulJZx7oRNaSXiHjrJ5zCgVpD0_DKDxZ0EL6msKeA2-IXBBAVW0au63y-sduz61cKPr3CsgI_dCodvE9EHwj2CMZhZ0lBHmbHEzlLAYjAUWTJw9jqx7c_2MbmvPKwfAMVy2l6MEBjpYgUhCgPx65bCF0WrLY=w400-h180" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Meeting a prophetess in Móstoles</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">We rather warmed to her but I was also on my guard as this was all too surreal. Eladio later told me people like her are out for other people's money. Meeting Elizabeth was quite something. We mentioned our squatter issue and she prophesied he would be gone in 3 days time. She told me to go home, lie down somewhere and read Psalm 23 (The Lord's my shepherd I shall not want ......). We could only hope her prophesy would come true but of course it didn't.  Coincidence or not though, that day I got a lucrative booking on Airbnb for June which made me think. In any case it was quite a fun and inspiring moment. </div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Oli then dropped me off at home just in time for our lunch which dear Lucy had taken care of.  We had a quiet siesta during which FT had arrived home and was knocking on the door. We refused to open it until after the siesta. It is Eladio who opens the door for him, not me. I just can't face him. He has taken to leaving windows open so as to climb back into the house without us having to open the door but we have cottoned on to his trick and shut them after he has left. Damn the man.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Amanda and I had our usual Monday afternoon Skype call that day where we chat, commiserate, laugh etc for a good 2 hours. These calls do us both such good. Then there was dinner to look forward to. We had booked a table for 8.30 and were there promptly. The restaurant was quite full which figured as it was St. Valentines Day. I always go for the meat - the best in the area - and my husband always goes for fish. His choice that night was cod. As the portions are so big and we cannot eat too much in the evening we skipped both starters and pudding. I do realise that the older we get the less we are able to eat. Our choice of drink was cider as the restaurant is Basque where cider is popular. It is too in our beloved Asturias. Instead of enjoying a starter we enjoyed the bread and a small bowl of pumpkin soup that came with the meal. Here I am toasting my Valentine.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEizMnhA4ZxHlnbxdG-8osj0ckiRytCM1YL5SvQ1nwD2GuaixI6ebafqTUI2qBnvGUNqcNRaqlcH4LKljqcC9ngcHFCuEAqARY4nXS9Dua4PERuqVlpMaC3nQHeMabcdzfoVeymnZsMDBEyIfCYvSg8w21Fg0Ibxc_kIwfQZY3Ci1EkMSsGshws=s4032" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEizMnhA4ZxHlnbxdG-8osj0ckiRytCM1YL5SvQ1nwD2GuaixI6ebafqTUI2qBnvGUNqcNRaqlcH4LKljqcC9ngcHFCuEAqARY4nXS9Dua4PERuqVlpMaC3nQHeMabcdzfoVeymnZsMDBEyIfCYvSg8w21Fg0Ibxc_kIwfQZY3Ci1EkMSsGshws=w180-h400" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A toast to our love at dinner on St. Valentines Day</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">When I posted some of the pictures on social media, my dear friend Sandra commented "love how you always celebrate your love now more than ever". She is completely right. I am very lucky to have married Eladio and that our love is still going strong after so many years - 42 since we first met in 1980. </div></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhBclnoINivFfHrXDjU69coU0V6P0_yDx3APPkXW7iehwMxcyeIyssQKgkYhrt1O2UzParkYbUQy9RtlRrBuygUp0VsuMMMUgBCMpEOuxPnkfkTdMkxt7KawgGGuwhzGoHCOyKUBkNiF4QUsTLpgiOlKOt_CJ9g4enHmweIMucfCrmOM2U6I54=s4032" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhBclnoINivFfHrXDjU69coU0V6P0_yDx3APPkXW7iehwMxcyeIyssQKgkYhrt1O2UzParkYbUQy9RtlRrBuygUp0VsuMMMUgBCMpEOuxPnkfkTdMkxt7KawgGGuwhzGoHCOyKUBkNiF4QUsTLpgiOlKOt_CJ9g4enHmweIMucfCrmOM2U6I54=w400-h180" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Not our best St. Valentines pic</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We left early as we only had one course and were soon home to an empty house except for "him" and dear Lucy who holds the fort when we are out. Our guests had left that night and the next group are not coming until this week but I was happy to get 3 new reservations on Airbnb just as we were finishing our meal, two of them were for June which is when the prophetess Elizabeth had prophesied any money problems would be solved hahahahha. I got another one yesterday. Oscar arrived at lunch time and will be here for 2 nights. As we come out of winter hibernation, reservations seem to be picking up. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">That night I slept relatively well. The earlier stress from our nightmare I think has now receded as has the media exposure - that was very draining. Also I was prescribed some anti anxiety pills by my Doctor. They are called sertraline (50mg). Whether I am feeling less stressed because of the medication or because I am getting used to the situation I cannot tell but I am definitely calmer now. Thus I sleep better.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I was up at 7 am on <b>Tuesday</b>. That morning after our walk we had an appointment at our bank - La Caixa, before Bankia. I needed them to change my residency card to my new Spanish ID - yet another task to do after getting Spanish nationality. Without that change I wouldn't be able to receive my pension so it was an important mission. My bank account assistant, Marisa, is not the friendliest nor the most efficient person but at least she now treats me more kindly. I left the bank not knowing when the change would become effective and would only know the following days. It was thank goodness. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We then decided on a coffee together, a morning ritual when we are out. Did you know that in Sweden, coffee with friends is called "<a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/what-in-the-world-is-fika-an-intro-to-the-swedish-coffee-break-the-art-of-fika-219297">fika</a>"?  It is basically a coffee break. I learned the word and term when I used to work for Yoigo which belonged to the Swedish national operator, Telia. I totally relate to "fika" which is something of a ritual in that Nordic country. The BBC recently did a story on this custom entitled "<i><a href="https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p0bmzygz/the-swedish-tradition-that-can-make-you-happier-at-work">The Swedish tradition that can make you happier at work</a></i>". I couldn't agree more; not just at work but in any situation. In most companies there "fika" is an allowed break at 10 am and at 3 pm. The idea is for workers to get a mental and physical break so that they come back refreshed and happy to continue work. What a great idea. The  word "fika" derives from the slang for coffee "kaffi" apparently and is inverted - not sure why. When you fika and you can use it as a verb  or as a noun, you take time off to enjoy a break in company. You never fika on your own. Fika also involves eating a little something, usually a typical cinnamon bun. To have our "fika", we drove to Alverán - must take you there if you ever come to visit - and my little something was a piece of toast and butter. Being born a Brit I only ever eat bread if it is with butter. That is something Spaniards do not understand. But oh they do understand "fika" although it is called something else here - something like a mid morning break during a long working shift. So, yes I love to "fika" but let me tell you something. The Swedes have great cakes and buns but their coffee is not a patch on coffee in Spain or at least not in my experience. Eladio and I are like chalk and cheese when it comes to how we drink our coffee when we go out to "fika". I order mine not too hot, strong and with plenty of foamed milk. Eladio orders his - if it is available with soy milk and honey, usually decaf and with zero foam. Eladio doesn't really "fika" as he never eats anything with his coffee. I am greedier and have always been. I had to have a photo to show you how we had our fika on Tuesday after the boring bank visit.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiE5MQs-HIpi2TImhWOMg1Jy477WyiL-Hq3XBvaUHCn7bbDpRvoGVA3LloZ5iq3sS_XlXtUoJIKINH6pyiv0JDgP_Klfr5GDBkMti8op0YTETlReiXSUWpaAX_PAauV-NbMF6nM_9Li39gFt0yNkK3o9mH1AOIRXyIqr9Jg04NCV43H1z8zJho=s4032" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiE5MQs-HIpi2TImhWOMg1Jy477WyiL-Hq3XBvaUHCn7bbDpRvoGVA3LloZ5iq3sS_XlXtUoJIKINH6pyiv0JDgP_Klfr5GDBkMti8op0YTETlReiXSUWpaAX_PAauV-NbMF6nM_9Li39gFt0yNkK3o9mH1AOIRXyIqr9Jg04NCV43H1z8zJho=w400-h180" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><br></br><i>"Fika" at Alverán on Tuesday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Alverán cafe is also Felipe Turover's favourite place but we haven't seen him there for ages thank goodness. He is keeping very quiet these days. We try to rise above the situation and get on with our lives but his presence is always there and always threatening. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Our daily routine as you know by now if you read this blog often nearly always involves coffee out or "fika" but also a walk with Pippa, lunch at 2 on the dot and dinner at around 8 pm. Part of our routine is watching the news at lunchtime and after dinner. The news these days is dominated by the threat of Russia invading the Ukraine - they haven't done it yet and let's hope they don't. In Spain the main news was the outcome of regional elections in the area called "Castilla León"  a very rural area with a big part of what is now called "empty Spain" (la España vaciada). That is where Eladio's village is located in a very remote part of Castilla León. The right wing party PP won but as usual these days did not get a majority. The far right wing party, Vox, got 13 seats which means that the PP will have to rely on Vox. I used to hate Vox for its ideas but, my friends, this is the only party that wants to change the law governing squatters. Thus, for the first time in my life I may be voting for a far right party. As it happens I can finally vote in all types of elections now that I have Spanish nationality. With British nationality I could only vote in the very local (not regional) and EU elections. You will also know that as a Brit who has lived outside the UK for more than 15 years I haven't been able to vote in the country where I was born or in Spain for more than 25 years. That means of course I had no say in Brexit. Well, I won't rant about that. I am bored with politics in Spain and am not at all interested in the recent regional elections. More exciting is what is happening in Madrid where the PP  opposition party governs. The fight is between the President Isabel Diaz Ayuso and the head of the party, Pablo Casado. The main issue is a contract for face masks awarded by the Madrid government to a company owned by a family friend and the fact that Diaz Ayuso's brother was involved and got a substantial commission. No doubt this will continue to be the main news for weeks now. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">But the news that caught my attention after lunch on Tuesday was both Spanish and international. A Spanish fishing boat from Galicia called "Villa de Pitanxo" had sunk in waters near Terranova, Newfoundland in Canada, the night before. The trawler was not so near really; about 450 kilometres from the coast. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiqJVMoXkbBloZautFx8DaEzT7DvctnTDwbSZEggT9g8-NeCG7QkG0AkCEISy7E1pY0qkPXXWK2NWGcZ6doEJSW-eZjdffIDHB6LLrC5WpwDAy099d1D9P4nKZBCWp8_9efnZi4a-qvOYeXQbsovcb4024IUyEJSitniRDmiJjQns1q4hZrOKc=s624" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="246" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiqJVMoXkbBloZautFx8DaEzT7DvctnTDwbSZEggT9g8-NeCG7QkG0AkCEISy7E1pY0qkPXXWK2NWGcZ6doEJSW-eZjdffIDHB6LLrC5WpwDAy099d1D9P4nKZBCWp8_9efnZi4a-qvOYeXQbsovcb4024IUyEJSitniRDmiJjQns1q4hZrOKc=w400-h246" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Spanish fishing trawler Villa de Pitanxo which sunk in Newfoundland waters this week</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It seems the sea was very rough and of course ice cold. There was a crew of 24 men, most Spanish but some from Peru and Ghana and only 3 have been found alive. There were 4 lifeboats but only one was found with survivors.  This is tragic news and I can't begin to imagine the pain of those families who have lost a member in the cold sea so far from home.  As I write 7 are dead and 14 are missing with just 3 survivors.  This was the main news in Spain that day and it was very sad.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">If that was sad, words from the British actress Emma Thompson about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jRyNqlftvHI">women's bodies</a> was perhaps the piece of news that I could really relate to. She was talking about a scene in a new film where she had to stand naked in front of a mirror. This is what she said: "<i>If I stand in front of a mirror, I'm always sort of pulling something or I'll turn to the side, I'll do something. I can't just stand there. Why would I do that, it's horrifying</i>" said the the 61 year old actress. She also said people weren't used to seeing untreated bodies on screen and added "<i>but that's the problem isn't it, that women have been brainwashed all their lives to hate our bodies. That's just the fact. And everything that surrounds us reminds us how imperfect we are, and everything is wrong with us</i>". </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgPM_w11dOUO3Vxa_4DHUWa0UOCF6iIsU1dMyaSWPRKuYhGTyczVMrGLWLwdo-9B5TNJu7QxaV_5Pfg_qFKADNcTqgZPfbBw_6MiqLcPfGls8AxwP0X3SK4xmlBq1L8un00fm9XhYQGlAd9mVHjK7XRcM5teAk9uoc4ApWSKtRKfLVqgPYXpsc=s505" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="399" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgPM_w11dOUO3Vxa_4DHUWa0UOCF6iIsU1dMyaSWPRKuYhGTyczVMrGLWLwdo-9B5TNJu7QxaV_5Pfg_qFKADNcTqgZPfbBw_6MiqLcPfGls8AxwP0X3SK4xmlBq1L8un00fm9XhYQGlAd9mVHjK7XRcM5teAk9uoc4ApWSKtRKfLVqgPYXpsc=w400-h399" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i> Emma Thompson said out loud what all women think. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Wow she said what probably all women think secretly. I do at least. How right she is. I can only imagine very few women can't find any fault with their bodies. So if we hate our bodies, how on earth can we be happy? Why do we care? Because we are inundated with the idea of the perfect body we can never ever aspire to, especially as we become middle aged and grow old. But younger women too hate their bodies. They should learn to love them because they will only get uglier as they grow old. We are never happy with what we have are we?  Emma mouthed what nearly all women think but never say. Her words are profoundly significant and yesterday they helped to make me care less about my "horrible body". Yes, that's what I think about my body. Maybe now she has said it out loud I shall start to care less. All the bodies we see on screen, unless we are talking about young teenage girls, need to be "treated" if they are to be portrayed as perfect. We are not perfect and when we learn that we may learn to love ourselves a bit more. Thank you Emma for your words. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As a woman and British citizen, no doubt Emma Thompson, was as disgusted as me at the news of Prince Andrew's up to 10 million pound settlement in the sexual  abuse case we all know about.

Instead of a trial with a jury, this week the Duke's lawyers came to a private out of court settlement with Ms. Giuffre whereby he is to pay her up to 12 million pounds and come away free from justice. I would have liked to see him tried and condemned in court but now his actions are covered up by blood money. Shame too on Ms. Guiffre who should have pursued him in court instead of accepting his money. This was not the outcome I expected nor one that I can accept. I wonder what his own mother, the 95 year old Queen thinks. The whole scandal has in a way tainted what would otherwise have been her glorious 70 year reign jubilee year. Another scandal from her eldest son and heir to the throne may further taint the year. Prince Charles is involved in a "cash for honours" inquiry. Basically this is to do with a charity of his being donated funds by millionaires keen to get honours such as the CBE in return. One case is that of Suadi donor Mahfourz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz who donated 1.5 million pounds in exchange not only for a CBE but also for British citizenship. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEitbFiaUNqQcTvUiTg7ZakpsumV7TM_Y4yqOTyVS-YF3_Ei_C6RoVnCKFlmITVCU0ME7Cz-lCqoVg9EKOz_QJhZaaf_SaIEkIQoLApr-_jA1lOpTGjO7ouYMLblNxg7qst7IYPKTFxJQJxUxlTBKeIz-syY8_dj0K_PpSO3Gpd7JUsHblZcPeU=s640" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEitbFiaUNqQcTvUiTg7ZakpsumV7TM_Y4yqOTyVS-YF3_Ei_C6RoVnCKFlmITVCU0ME7Cz-lCqoVg9EKOz_QJhZaaf_SaIEkIQoLApr-_jA1lOpTGjO7ouYMLblNxg7qst7IYPKTFxJQJxUxlTBKeIz-syY8_dj0K_PpSO3Gpd7JUsHblZcPeU=w320-h400" width="320"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Another damaging image - Camila, Charles and the Saudi billionaire Mafhouz - believed to have donated 1.5 million pounds to a Prince of Wales charity in exchange for a CBE and British citizenship.

This is a citizenship for investment visa of over 2 million pounds in the UK. This has led to a vast number of expensive properties being in foreign hands, often Russian oligarchs. No wonder London is now referred to as "Londongrad".  Thankfully due to the Ukraine crisis the Home Office will be changing the rules.  Like his brother before him, Prince Charles  claims he knew nothing about the cash for honours cases. I bet he did. I also  bet both he, the Queen and his brother are losing their sleep over these scandals, some of the worst ever to affect Buckingham Palace. </div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Part of our routine is also our daily siesta. I go through the motions but don't often actually sleep. When I can't I turn to my iPad with headphones, so as not to disturb my husband and watch something on a streaming platform. It was on Tuesday I started on Line of Duty Season 6 and I had finished it by Friday.  This is one of the best British detective series ever. I had devoured seasons 1 to 5 and then watched it all again so when Oli told me Season 6 was now available, I was as pleased as punch. That day I watched 3 of the 7 episodes. It's so clever and the dialogue is great. My overall favourite is Detective Superintendent "Ted" Hastings played by  the Northern Ireland actor Adrian Dunbar. There was a great line in one of the episodes when he tells a superior officer "<i>The name's Hastings ma'am, I'm the epitome of an old battle</i>". I say a round of applause is due to the script writers of this addictive and real life series. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg4wdIo6BSEEga4-2R7enBccRk95dnOXDFZqsJjD7zM0eDqSs8uO2dfdGd-Dj9GcUM89vi_N2dn-srGig2RimBqqv_X3NteQGFCWq0V_ZSLc-zGsPAOYS7HWABfwETvXtePpv26w4v8k-OVON-BzDITrG_s9p1XTxW9C05cN3tmsEsshvjanZo=s760" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="266" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg4wdIo6BSEEga4-2R7enBccRk95dnOXDFZqsJjD7zM0eDqSs8uO2dfdGd-Dj9GcUM89vi_N2dn-srGig2RimBqqv_X3NteQGFCWq0V_ZSLc-zGsPAOYS7HWABfwETvXtePpv26w4v8k-OVON-BzDITrG_s9p1XTxW9C05cN3tmsEsshvjanZo=w400-h266" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The much loved DS Hastings played by Adrian Dunbar</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">I loved that quote but I think my favourite is: "Jesus, Mary and Joseph and the wee donkey" . He also continually says "Mother of God". His character is interesting not just because of his great acting and quotes but because he is portrayed as a Catholic Northern Ireland man and there are few of them. Thus he was one of the very few who served in the RUC (Royal Ulster Constabulary) and thus is always seen as an outsider.  I suppose all of you reading this are great fans of this series watched by more than 13 million in the UK. So I think you will love this "<i><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p099hkl8">beginners' guide to Line of Duty</a></i>".

It was a word I got right but only through guess work as I had never heard of it. The mystery word was "<b>caulk</b>". The definition is: "waterproof filler and sealant (don't know that word either), used in building work and repair" A better definition is "substance used to fill gaps around the edge of something, for example a bath".  I thought that was far too obscure. People are complaining the game has become more difficult since it was bought by the NYT. I don't know about that but what I do know is that because of cancel culture some 5 letter words have been removed from their list. I know that as I tried the word "slave" recently. How pathetic. I am fed up with wokes, this new thing about pronouns, being politically correct and as to cancel culture, it baffles me. It all seems part of a Brave New World just like Huxley described in his book of the same name. Today it seems we are more  censored than ever when it should be quite the opposite. At least I can nearly say what I want in my own blog or at least I think I can. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Our news on Wednesday won't be of much interest to you but it was to us. This week a local carpenter finally changed the front door of our new but hundred year old house in Asturias. We loved the quaint original stable door but there were gaps where the cold comes in. Also when we shut it all the light was stopped from coming in making the hall very dark. We found the carpenter back in October and it wasn't until this week that he finished the job. He made a door to look like the old door - stable door too - but included 2 glass panes to let the light in. This is what it looked like before and what it looks like now (bar a knob he still has to put in).</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEguT9a8WUvJoF7rT_VkTUGOw_mxieK52VeSnaxRqGAEBUe0kxc-Ap5FKospe-eEBoeRgrA0rX43eWWqSGlLxSQ6aQxhIeYs0N2RrMYHqT2_XnNyuLIM1b9jQnFzlxtACGZRbzvwt0hlLRGiabo2bsZ1OFIEA6cjNVplxDQRARbDwD0Qz9lgro0=s1052" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEguT9a8WUvJoF7rT_VkTUGOw_mxieK52VeSnaxRqGAEBUe0kxc-Ap5FKospe-eEBoeRgrA0rX43eWWqSGlLxSQ6aQxhIeYs0N2RrMYHqT2_XnNyuLIM1b9jQnFzlxtACGZRbzvwt0hlLRGiabo2bsZ1OFIEA6cjNVplxDQRARbDwD0Qz9lgro0=w225-h400" width="225"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The old door from the outside</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj57BOewYa4sBxb2A4AFRYLFyIPT1AaZsmeEcPbe1TptVwC4kHP1qCq4myFfUVAlYQ_-4M-oVAcKecK3AkSvJ7FKHIOmm6Oj1Dh6ss6gazW-hJn1Xuq-vDj7Ho1I9cd4sLvtWHMn3nQP9h2VAhCUKOoliRfilGZ2dVl1dIC-uFO3BcFN8NA_JU=s1600" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj57BOewYa4sBxb2A4AFRYLFyIPT1AaZsmeEcPbe1TptVwC4kHP1qCq4myFfUVAlYQ_-4M-oVAcKecK3AkSvJ7FKHIOmm6Oj1Dh6ss6gazW-hJn1Xuq-vDj7Ho1I9cd4sLvtWHMn3nQP9h2VAhCUKOoliRfilGZ2dVl1dIC-uFO3BcFN8NA_JU=w299-h400" width="299"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The new door from the inside</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">We haven't been since October and are thinking of going next week.

Miguel and Elliot had gone to have dinner at his mother's so Oli suggested we join her. It was nice to get out and see her and little Juliet. But their new flat seemed empty without Elliot's presence. He is so funny and so full of life but a bit of a handful. Oli told me that in his daily school reports he has never yet got a star for good behaviour. At nearly two and a half he still wants to breast feed which Oli finds tiring. Elliot's teacher "Itchy" (Itziar) suggested weaning him by only letting him do so for a minute. He has quickly learned to say "just a minute" and then takes one of Oli's boobs out of her blouse - sorry for the crude description - which makes me laugh. He is not a good sleeper and demands Oli's presence "for just a minute" during the night too and when Miguel offers to take over he is shooed away by Elliot when he says "Daddy no", "Daddy go". No wonder poor Oli is exhausted. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We had an early and peaceful dinner without Elliot and Oli served some lovely food.

Wow! Today Julio is a successful professor at the UNED University. He took me to the "Jardin de la Maquina" a swanky restaurant near where we used to work in Pozuelo. We sat outside as the temperature was 20ºc and our table was next to the artificial lake. It used to be the "Leyenda" restaurant where I have been many times. Today it is more upmarket. We had a marvelous lunch which Julio treated me to. We shared mini scallops and for "seconds" I had lamb chops and Julio had filet mignon. Delicious. I have chosen a photo of the two of us having lunch as this week's feature photo. It was so good to get out, good to see a friend and to socialise again. Thank you "Julito".  He told me he found me in much better spirits than when he last saw me over a month ago. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I was home late and had lots to tell Eladio who himself had been out to lunch.

I think I told you recently the amount of addictive medicine this man consumes which I found out about through my friend a chemist. So it had to be his doctor who was prescribing all this and we wanted to know why and also whether he is a real suicide threat or physical threat to us. We found out  he takes so many pills as he has built a very strong tolerance to them. We also found out he had a big alcohol problem a few years ago. Whether any of this information will be of use at court I doubt but it will certainly be of great interest if I ever write a book about living with a  Russian spy in the room next door don't you think?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I wonder whether DS Hastings and his team, Steve Arnott and Kate Fleming would be interested in playing one of the parts if the story is taken up by Netflix haha.

I then had no option but to start all over. I can't get enough of Line of Duty.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">After the health centre I drove home to pick up Eladio and go and do the weekly shopping.

The wind was so strong that people were actually blown over while trying to walk. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjMA0H8ZMT2uDJ4W2PtA9JpvK-5BNFSubb_20FnUMoQpSraTqO9BhlD5mngJOHmU4FLZV3lzzAqHFPP8Urg6KeJxJF87yiq5jyaHVcnI1xfqnZEDBmFqZ9Rlwk6hg_x2n0iNy1U-omZ9qNdrSbskHzVb89uBDbIIHQNkPfIK7RF-QzjC26z70A=s299" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="226" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjMA0H8ZMT2uDJ4W2PtA9JpvK-5BNFSubb_20FnUMoQpSraTqO9BhlD5mngJOHmU4FLZV3lzzAqHFPP8Urg6KeJxJF87yiq5jyaHVcnI1xfqnZEDBmFqZ9Rlwk6hg_x2n0iNy1U-omZ9qNdrSbskHzVb89uBDbIIHQNkPfIK7RF-QzjC26z70A=w400-h226" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Storm Eunice</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">Imagine that. Damage was terrible with electricity cut, trees falling,  flying debris, roofs  (used to be rooves) blowing open - the O2 arena included and even the spire of the St .Thomas church in Wells fell over.  Most transport was cancelled, it was nearly impossible for planes to land at Heathrow, classes were cancelled and people were warned to stay at home. The record breaking winds claimed 4 lives and then went on to carry its course into northern Europe. I imagine the UK is still reeling from this storm of the century. </div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Storm Eunice affected the weather in many parts of Europe but hardly reached Madrid. But it did affect the temperature which fell from about 20 to 10c from one day to the next. Thus we had to dress up warmly for our <b>Saturday</b> morning walk. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">On Saturday I came face to face with blatant age discrimination when I went to have my driving licence renewed. It seems that 65 is the official age to be considered old in Spain and never so more than when it comes to renewing your licence. Up till  65 licences last for 10 years. Not so when you reach 65. They are then renewed for 5 years. The stupid thing is if I had gone on 7th February, my last day of being 64 I could have had it renewed for 10 years. But I had no idea of this age discrimination. No doubt I will be facing more soon. There was even health discrimination too. When I told the doctor doing the eye test that I had had a cataract operation, the 5 years were reduced to 3. I had to plead with the administrator to take that off the record. I could not believe what I was hearing as for God's sake the operation had improved my eye sight. But no, those are the rules. Thankfully the administrator, worried I would take my application elsewhere where I would not make the mistake of mentioning the operation, agreed to change my record. I walked out without a provisional driving licence as  my new identity - the change from a residency card to a Spanish ID card (once again)  - would have to be notified to the authorities before renewing my licence. Thus if I drive before I get it, I will be breaking the law. Damn the system. It's so stupid. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Apart from that yesterday was the quietest day of the week, the highlight being our lunch. Yesterday I made one of our favourite dishes - yes meat again, sorry: shoulder of lamb with apricot stuffing. Delicious. That had me sleep a siesta from 3ish to 5.30, making up for any recent lost sleep thank goodness. I slept well last night too and only woke up at 7.15. Wordle was a bit of a challenge today but I got both the Spanish and English versions in 4 tries each. I only consider 3 tries as good. I wonder if anyone ever guesses the mystery word in one try. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Today will be a quiet day too. The sun is already shining and it will be warmish again with the temperature reaching 15ºcm which is not bad for February.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I have now reached the end of this week's tales so all that remains is to wish you all the best until next Sunday.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cheers my friends,</div><div>Masha</div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br></div><div><div><br></br></div><div><br></br></div></div></div></div>
