Spain suffered the worst train crash in a decade with a death toll of 45 people in an accident that could have been avoided as we would find out during the week.</p><p><b>Last Sunday</b>&nbsp;morning those who died that night after the crash of two trains in Adamuz on the Andalusia Madrid high speed corridor at around 7.45 pm, were going about their lives. How life can change to death in just a few minutes with no prior warning. We had a quiet Sunday although I was very upset about my friends' loss something only time can heal and then never properly.</p><p>&nbsp;It was cold but sunny in Madrid that day and perfect for our walk.&nbsp; Here is Eladio fastening little Pippa's harness as she always comes with us. Usually she needs her woolen jumper but not that day.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-LCvxL_QB0Izcxz-fjt2ohCxM6hf4HauLjbk7miKH2dhiCMSaKIfgB4FIGtv0wDAdGj70aBsoo9gTRwa4AHTWRpmNzcHcog2YYaS5z-t6F5Fyb9g92AOrF_WPZ-TYwemW9SjFZxrXul903iYFl-GKPI7B4ggKu6Yco9VOySCt6nPpCp2i6Tv1Hw/s4000/20260118_111934.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img border="0" data-original-height="4000" data-original-width="1848" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-LCvxL_QB0Izcxz-fjt2ohCxM6hf4HauLjbk7miKH2dhiCMSaKIfgB4FIGtv0wDAdGj70aBsoo9gTRwa4AHTWRpmNzcHcog2YYaS5z-t6F5Fyb9g92AOrF_WPZ-TYwemW9SjFZxrXul903iYFl-GKPI7B4ggKu6Yco9VOySCt6nPpCp2i6Tv1Hw/w185-h400/20260118_111934.jpg" width="185" /></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>I love this picture of Eladio so lovingly preparing Pippa for her walk last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We were alone with all the guests gone, as well as Tana and Suzy at work. She has been a bit down lately but I think that after some cajoling from us, her mood has improved a bit. She always worries me.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>We heard about the train crash while watching the evening news in bed. At the time we were told that 2 had died. By the time I went to sleep the death toll had risen to 22 and to 39 in the morning until it reached 45 people. What on earth had happened? In the first place an Iryo train run by an Italian company which was heading to Madrid from Málaga and carrying 300 people, derailed from carriage 6 to 8 just outside Adamuz, in a remote part of Córdoba. That meant it fell on the opposite track. If it had just derailed and the traffic halted, there would probably have been no fatalities. But oh my God, just 20 seconds after it derailed another train, an Alvia (hybrid high speed train) carrying 180 people and heading from Madrid to Huelva, collided with the 3 carriages. The impact forced the first few carriages of the Renfe Alvia to fall down an embankment. That was also a fatality as it wasn't&nbsp; until at least 45 minutes later that rescue forces get to it. Below is a very good diagram of the accident I found from a railway expert.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8JJQcui0Sf5Qg4KYkOrUdhkooAXoBuj5tv6W29P_ty4koXDNiOOllYLQVnbm150sAXJdAAsl5X4OQsdxVaBvvVdF7goLUod9E9K7SAyZLf4Mfeti8qH66FfC7F92lfF_6luEFU97TG6UinWc7ZiVmlfb4CzcWH3W8gt3syQSNL4XeW-m1FUyx5w/s2048/1768813452101.jfif" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1093" data-original-width="2048" height="214" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8JJQcui0Sf5Qg4KYkOrUdhkooAXoBuj5tv6W29P_ty4koXDNiOOllYLQVnbm150sAXJdAAsl5X4OQsdxVaBvvVdF7goLUod9E9K7SAyZLf4Mfeti8qH66FfC7F92lfF_6luEFU97TG6UinWc7ZiVmlfb4CzcWH3W8gt3syQSNL4XeW-m1FUyx5w/w400-h214/1768813452101.jfif" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A diagram of the collision&nbsp;</i></td></tr></tbody></table>I woke up on <b>Monday</b> morning to read all this and was horrified. If only the second train hadn't been coming just 20 seconds after the first one had derailed.&nbsp;<br /><div><br /></div><div>Spain is so proud of its high speed train network, the largest in Europe and the second longest in the world after China.&nbsp; But I don't think anyone feels proud this week. Sad is the word or astounded. But of course accidents happen and it wasn't the only one this week. The others though happened due to external circumstances. With 4000 km of track the network connects most major cities in the country. In Spain the high speed network is called the "AVE" meaning a bird and I have taken it numerous times always feeling safe. I was on one of the first trains ever from Madrid to Seville during the Tour of Spain in 1992. It has grown so much since that most people today prefer the Ave to flying as it is much quicker. It boasts carrying 40 million passengers annually. Until now there has never been a fatal accident on a pure high speed train. The last major train crash which was in 2013, happened to an Alvia a hybrid version. It took place just outside Santiago de Compostela from where my daughter Olivia, a budding TV journalist at the time,&nbsp; reported extensively on the crash. She would also be reporting from the site of this week's terrible crash in the very unknown village of Adamuz, until now.&nbsp; With just 4000 inhabitants,&nbsp; it is nestled in an area populated with nothing more than olive trees and is about half an hour away from Córdoba. The villagers rose to the occasion and some of them reached the site saving people's lives before the rescue people got there. There was an added complication in that the Alvia was almost unreachable after falling down an embankment, leaving it 800 km away from the first train.&nbsp; Oli sent me lots of photos and was told she was being sent to cover the story of the villagers' involvement the next day.&nbsp;</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgq-lTXxcfLwuxqqM6H0p8Tz5butgYnwqwHt6te4qYtAyp9bIlhTLDuUi_IMdST3_0ZqZNpJ5uaWoYPz59H5dlS2rENSQKmWzl4_Zyi7Cv0RMBQmasSb64Xu2BchHTuAs0hX9ka5SpuQIDrdk23RQOyCOgtxUyuBoOAjnKBV30iDmuqc96Ki48Lcg/s1600/c864c6eb-b853-4bf6-bcdc-56199265e8f0_16-9-aspect-ratio_default_0.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="900" data-original-width="1600" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgq-lTXxcfLwuxqqM6H0p8Tz5butgYnwqwHt6te4qYtAyp9bIlhTLDuUi_IMdST3_0ZqZNpJ5uaWoYPz59H5dlS2rENSQKmWzl4_Zyi7Cv0RMBQmasSb64Xu2BchHTuAs0hX9ka5SpuQIDrdk23RQOyCOgtxUyuBoOAjnKBV30iDmuqc96Ki48Lcg/w400-h225/c864c6eb-b853-4bf6-bcdc-56199265e8f0_16-9-aspect-ratio_default_0.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Iryo train after derailing and being crashed into by the Alvia train.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Meanwhile, I had to rush off as I had an appointment with a doctor about what I though was oral thrush. I was to see a maxillofacial consultant at the local hospital, The Quiron, in Pozuelo. She took one look and told me it wasn't thrush but that I had a "geographic tongue". I had never heard of this apparently benign condition where the tongue goes red and feels inflamed and your taste buds are heightened so much you cannot stand even tooth paste. It creates a map like pattern, hence the name, when for unknown reasons the papillae move around leaving bare patches. She prescribed vitamins. I'm not sure whether they work or not but I can happily report it's much better now. Funny thing to have but thankfully it is benign.&nbsp;<br /><div><br /></div><div>We followed the news of the crash after lunch and most of the week in fact. It really affected me and I know no one involved but even so. That very morning as they were rescuing people, the investigations began and lots of speculation too. From very early on the Guardia Civil found a broken track&nbsp; which later turned out to be the reason for the derailment or so a preliminary report published on Friday.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCUCcUmgFsDFxQAsmNMEamwWhLB-oi1jT5yz9aN23d5GOPo1MatNpEPTqOP-Ijq4suSKFglupTZKqRWsoQDfMDaF0JdgO8FhWVxkSCrPOZR2dCqX3LOvepkIfIJFZbIndszoKhMxz0c3fnJfUhn5Tr2kBFqGKwA-ffFj0Xcz4de10bXl2trPUBZw/s800/53924030-f86e-11f0-9796-05e6aeca39b2.jpg.webp" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="449" data-original-width="800" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCUCcUmgFsDFxQAsmNMEamwWhLB-oi1jT5yz9aN23d5GOPo1MatNpEPTqOP-Ijq4suSKFglupTZKqRWsoQDfMDaF0JdgO8FhWVxkSCrPOZR2dCqX3LOvepkIfIJFZbIndszoKhMxz0c3fnJfUhn5Tr2kBFqGKwA-ffFj0Xcz4de10bXl2trPUBZw/w400-h225/53924030-f86e-11f0-9796-05e6aeca39b2.jpg.webp" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The crack in the track that is being treated as the main cause of the derailment of the first train.&nbsp;</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div>An English railway expert I came across on Twitter (sorry, Z), called Gareth Dennis wrote that "the Adamuz crash has a clear and predictable mechanism, triggered with very high likelihood by a broken rail at a weld" and according to him "this failure can only be because of inadequate inspection and maintenance".&nbsp; According to the report the rail investigation commission (CIAF), the 40 cm fracture occurred prior to the passage of the train. They know that from the notches seen on wheels of three earlier trains. The passage of the trains must have widened the crack until the disaster happened. It's difficult to envisage how 4000 km of rail track can be in a continuously perfect state without non stop maintenance.&nbsp; The Minister in charge, Oscar Puente swears maintenance took place regularly on this track and elsewhere but cannot explain the fracture. The investigation will now centre on the metal piece of the track to find out why it cracked. It shouldn't have. The big worry is if this can happen again. Spain declared three days of official mourning so for the first few days no one tried to take political advantage of the tragedy. Now the opposition is having a field day.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Meanwhile, Trump was playing his strange international political game. He published private letters to and from the Norwegian government and one from Macron. In his letter to the the Norwegian PM, he gripes about not getting the Nobel Peace Prize. In Spain, at least this week, he has garnered far less coverage than normal owing to our own tragedy. It was&nbsp; a good break but didn't last.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>It was lovely to talk that afternoon with my dear friends Kathy and Phil. We had so much to tell each other. I do miss them and hope I can travel sometime this year to Yorkshire to be with them.</div><div><br /></div><div>Oli had already travelled to Córdoba with her team and was reporting early in the morning from Adamuz. I followed her whole programme&nbsp; on <b>Tuesday</b> morning and felt very involved when it finished. She interviewed a 16 year old boy called Julio from the village who has since become known as the "Angel of Adamuz". He and his mother and a friend were coming back from fishing and were one of the first on the scene. They helped pulls victims from the wreckage and Julio gave a victim his own shoes. He saved one man's life whose father said Julio was his son's "guardian angel".&nbsp;</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaQFSXZ9qWAZm-pfPl_ZT7IHXyGuk7PAJjE20XeuWdohaQABhqoYGlvm3gU-zvja3LFnSMU-f2bAZduufqRf5dhmp3xAVGY9mFNc0gVoy8wP-7BDU0xdvuDgW_w3tWsytLkTKM0R-jw_IgMZEy4wVENglQfEkMMEviP5ggrq8WIAcyils3Xg_j-A/s4000/20260120_092101.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1848" data-original-width="4000" height="185" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaQFSXZ9qWAZm-pfPl_ZT7IHXyGuk7PAJjE20XeuWdohaQABhqoYGlvm3gU-zvja3LFnSMU-f2bAZduufqRf5dhmp3xAVGY9mFNc0gVoy8wP-7BDU0xdvuDgW_w3tWsytLkTKM0R-jw_IgMZEy4wVENglQfEkMMEviP5ggrq8WIAcyils3Xg_j-A/w400-h185/20260120_092101.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Olivia interviewing Julio the "angel of Adamuz" on Monday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>For a boy aged 16 he spoke remarkably well on TV and was very erudite despite&nbsp; his strong local accent. I wanted to know about his friend José's involvement and later Oli told me he just could not talk on camera.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogfr2RPenA4">Here is the video</a> of Oli's report and interview which I uploaded to my YouTube channel. Julio soon emerged as a national hero and was greeted by the King and Queen when they visited Adamuz that day. King Felipe told him&nbsp; he saw the best of Spanish youth reflected him. There were many other heroes from Adumuz, a town which will always be associated with this dreadful crash. I love the stories of how they all rallied round and helped the victims through the night.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Olivia later sent us a photo with a team from the French national broadcaster, TF1 she had bumped into in Adamuz.&nbsp; She said it was the highlight of her day as she is so keen on French as you all know.&nbsp;</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgn-D-iryi45shd0g_IubaS9K32mz1-UYChD9fBgOc4KJ6LNLuJT96hX_AkOebqKYNl-S8yROWFBT6sUvUf5PDNAj1Uayvj8mG1RDmE8pVp4AZhJFcVxND3CO-pwfH4IHchydnDgC0lFYDFii00jmAzVINpMf7MgTHmk9rSS0knnr2zYSXMONY2TA/s1600/IMG-20260120-WA0014.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgn-D-iryi45shd0g_IubaS9K32mz1-UYChD9fBgOc4KJ6LNLuJT96hX_AkOebqKYNl-S8yROWFBT6sUvUf5PDNAj1Uayvj8mG1RDmE8pVp4AZhJFcVxND3CO-pwfH4IHchydnDgC0lFYDFii00jmAzVINpMf7MgTHmk9rSS0knnr2zYSXMONY2TA/w400-h300/IMG-20260120-WA0014.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Olivia happy to meet colleagues from TF1 while reporting from Adamuz</i></td></tr></tbody></table>It was on Tuesday that Storm Harry hit Spain. It was because of the storm that another fatal train accident happened which claimed the life of a young trainee driver. It was an intercity train belonging to the Rodiales network in the Barcelona area which was hit by a landslide from a retaining wall dividing the track from the AP7 motorway. The wall collapsed on the train as it was passing by. It wasn't a problem of maintenance, just&nbsp; &nbsp;sheer bad luck. The landslide was caused by the heavy rain brought about by Storm Harry. Since then 2 more train accidents were reported this week making everyone go jittery about the safety of trains in Spain.&nbsp; One was in Cartagena where a building crane collided with the train and the other was in Asturias. Rock fell on the train as it came out of a tunnel. Thankfully, there were no fatalities on these last 2 accidents.&nbsp;<br /><div><br /></div><div>On <b>Wednesday</b> I was looking forward to watching Oli interview Julio again but she never told me when she would be on so I missed her. It was a rainy day as Storm Harry continued to cause havoc mostly in the north of Spain. When my daughter returned home from Córdoba and her children were whinging, she said to them "hey family, we are alive". How right she was in saying that. Indeed, we are all alive and have nothing relevant to whinge about.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>We did not go for a walk as the weather was foul. Instead I spent part of the morning&nbsp; cooking peacefully with Suzy. I made a chicken curry while she made a veg one and we ate in harmony together. I am glad to see that she is eating with us again, even if she only eats one meal a day.&nbsp; I must tell you too that we shall be enjoying her Kings' Day present, an invitation for the 4 of us to have lunch at Honest Greens on 6th February. I look forward to that.&nbsp;</div><div><p><b>Thursday</b>&nbsp;was important for Greenland. World leaders and important people were meeting in Davos this week and Trump was there too, of course and that day announced a deal for Greenland.&nbsp; I think the head of Nato, the former Dutch PM, Mark Rutte, must have got his ear and brought him to his senses about his obsession to claim Greenland.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have been reading that Trump is often referred to as "TACO" and it's not the Mexican tortilla. It means "Trump always chickens out". I think the meaning is that he is extreme in his negotiating and aims higher than is imaginable just to get his objective. So, maybe, in the end he didn't really mean to claim Greenland&nbsp; - which by the way he often referred to as Iceland by mistake - but to get what he wanted there; more NATO and US presence. I might be wrong or right I don't know with this man. The stupid thing is that with the current agreement signed between Denmark and the USA after WW2, all or most of what Trump wanted he already had, such as more US bases. Rutte must have got him to agree to more military presence of both the US and NATO on the biggest island in the world. For the moment Greenland's sovereignty is saved and the 25% tariffs imposed on the EU countries who sent troops, withdrawn. All that drama for what I ask?</p><p>While in Davos, Trump continued to advertise his latest scheme, his very own Board of Peace which many think he wants to put in place to rival the United Nations. On board now are some very dubious countries who have paid millions to be members. First on the agenda is turning Gaza into a sort of Middle East Miami. The UK and Spain have refused to become members.&nbsp;</p><p>Nothing exciting was happening here that day or on <b>Friday</b>.&nbsp; We went food shopping and it was lovely that Suzy joined us and got out of the house for once. Coffee at Alverán was the highlight although we had to have it inside as it was so cold.&nbsp;</p><p>Storm Harry now turned into Storm Ingrid hit León where we are going tomorrow as well as Montrondo. We had toyed with going to Montrondo this weekend but couldn't even think of trying to get there because of a heavy snowfall. Eladio's sister rang worried about our car journey to León tomorrow as it was snowing there too that morning. The alternative is going by the AVE which for the moment&nbsp; neither of us wants to do. Hopefully by tomorrow all the roads will be clear. We are going and coming back on the same day. It's to meet with Eladio's siblings to finally sign papers and get individual deeds for the houses and plots of land we have in Montrondo.&nbsp;</p><p>On Friday we had an important engagement in Madrid. It was to go to the funeral of our friend Benito&nbsp; who passed away just before Christmas. You will have read about his passing away when I wrote a while back. What a sad Christmas for his wife and life time partner Loli. They are our oldest friends in Spain and we met them when we lived in Saconia in about 1981 or 1982 and have kept in touch always. Here is a photo of the four of last year just before Christmas. No one knew it would be Benito's last. How sad.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqNKiKjHgt2rKdrBr5MhBFlnPMmRHc08l4pNshrayqdz_T5R09luubCLLI3rc-N2CuyIGexuj1MPdesvIf7teNyo51xxGP3NXnHsAWunqnrbKj1o8cTVsG8DRS5w6tzleacCzQwbOmmVWyqoeHxvEj4JYbRASBhxwx6srS20JON6B5CVF4CqMWEg/s4032/20241210_170821.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1816" data-original-width="4032" height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjqNKiKjHgt2rKdrBr5MhBFlnPMmRHc08l4pNshrayqdz_T5R09luubCLLI3rc-N2CuyIGexuj1MPdesvIf7teNyo51xxGP3NXnHsAWunqnrbKj1o8cTVsG8DRS5w6tzleacCzQwbOmmVWyqoeHxvEj4JYbRASBhxwx6srS20JON6B5CVF4CqMWEg/w400-h180/20241210_170821.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>With Benito and Loli on 10th December last year at Filandón.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We went by car and metro to the church in Madrid where the funeral was held. The Iglesia de Santa Teresa and Santa Elena is beautiful. I'm not sure but I think it is where they first met and fell in love. Benito, like Eladio, was a man of the cloth too so we share similar romantic beginnings. They were both teachers like Eladio so we had a lot in common.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Just before the funeral began, Loli asked Eladio to read one of the lessons which I thought was very touching. But sadly, very sadly, when he saw the text shown to him by the priest, he had to decline because of his poor eyesight. Eladio has degenerative macular disease in both eyes and can only read if the text is very big. The funeral was very fitting with lovely music - an organ player and male singer. We were happy to see too a very big turn out at the lovely church. When the mass was over we paid our condolences once again to Loli and then slipped out quietly into the dark and cold night in the centre of Madrid. In Spain there is no tradition of a wake; food and drink after a funeral which I always find a little lacking but that's how it is.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>We were home late but on time for a little something to eat. We coincided with the arrival of one our guests, Mar who Pippa was barking at madly. I haven't seen our other two guests, Leonardo and Dani but hope their stay was uneventful.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Saturday</b> dawned and the sun shone. I had something to smile about yesterday as Oli and family were coming for dinner that night.</div><div><br /></div><div>The sun didn't shine in Minnesota and no one was smiling.&nbsp; It is freezing cold there and as you know there is huge unrest after Trump's thugs - the ICE immigration forces - 2000 of them - are hunting for illegal immigrants. This is part of Trump's crack down on immigrants. Since he came to office last year there have been 2.2 million self deportations and more than 675.000 deportations, almost all of them carried out in a disgusting and cruel way. ICE are even detaining small children. Yesterday they shot a young man who was protesting as many locals are because they cannot comprehend what is happening and are appalled. His name was Alex Pretti and he was a 37 year old nurse born and bred in the States. ICE are even going after their own citizens. They claimed he was brandishing his gun when he wasn't. All I can say is that the US is a monster government with a monster at the helm. This cannot be happening and reminds me of how Hitler's thugs went after Jews in Germany before and during WW2. This is history repeating itself in the USA, the very country that opened its arms to survivors of the War. It beggars belief. It really does. What happened to liberty, equality, democracy and the rule of law, all values of the US Constitution? I am infinitely glad I live in Spain where we have our problems but none like this. But my heart goes out to those immigrants living in fear of deportation, not daring to leave their houses. Their American dream has become a nightmare.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Our day was quiet. Tana left for the weekend and our guests were in class at the University. We went for our walk and had a pleasant lunch with Suzy. It was in the late afternoon I prepared our family dinner and made meat loaf with oven baked root vegetables to go with it. For the first time ever we were to taste dark purple carrots I had found at Carrefour.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Oli and family, meanwhile, were at a Judo competition, Elliot was participating in. And my goodness, he came second, quite a feat. Here is a picture to remember the day and his win. I love his blue kimono.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEga5W-2AxqcuqQuTjllYPFnreiqvvAbfMugZwZYEayqeMI8BrHvrNmCYqwEvnEaeXrE-hFiJog04_3PWdZPhqqcTpqBD5zNIHQRpkhz4RrrH2OQfwM9bu2xgtoh_Ukt00do74aNjvm84K60cNZUkzoXReH7xrMz40agt7_AK7Z8ea2YseEkUkiQMw/s1600/IMG-20260124-WA0004.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEga5W-2AxqcuqQuTjllYPFnreiqvvAbfMugZwZYEayqeMI8BrHvrNmCYqwEvnEaeXrE-hFiJog04_3PWdZPhqqcTpqBD5zNIHQRpkhz4RrrH2OQfwM9bu2xgtoh_Ukt00do74aNjvm84K60cNZUkzoXReH7xrMz40agt7_AK7Z8ea2YseEkUkiQMw/w400-h300/IMG-20260124-WA0004.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Elliot came 2nd in the judo competition he participated in yesterday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div>After a sleepless siesta, I went down to the kitchen to prepare our dinner but got a bit waylaid when our friend Loli rang me to thank us for going to the funeral. She didn't have to thank us as we wanted to be there. As Loli is from Seville, we spoke about the train accident. Would you believe 2 of her ex colleagues were in carriage number 5 of the Iryo train accident and made it to the funeral? Carriage 5 was saved as it didn't derail. The train shuddered and stopped but they didn't know what had happened even when they got them out. They were led to the village of Adamuz and from there went by bus to Madrid. Only when they saw the images on the TV did they realise the magnitude of the accident they had escaped. They are still reeling from the shock of it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Oli and family came early and we had quality time together. It was Juliet who said she wanted a photo with her grandparents and thus we had&nbsp; a photo session in the kitchen with me, as usual, in my pink dressing gown which I seem to live in. I have chosen one of them as this week's feature photo and here is one of Oli and her family together.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg-2C4-SAKuSPEX7W2dJuZKX45sYwmUmfHE91Tl3GeFmaxBB-NbvuP5X6fPv_dqtNK2ZyRTaKqWIgLdys3K5ehcLCFQC2Mgxn5nbspkb02S7gsHzRJ2rgfVbozpLwROB31jvcrlC8u0cwwQwps57NbY2eQpYWKzBc8o4cidl8bJbpe9cTYs7ZHTUQ/s4000/20260124_190708.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="4000" data-original-width="1848" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg-2C4-SAKuSPEX7W2dJuZKX45sYwmUmfHE91Tl3GeFmaxBB-NbvuP5X6fPv_dqtNK2ZyRTaKqWIgLdys3K5ehcLCFQC2Mgxn5nbspkb02S7gsHzRJ2rgfVbozpLwROB31jvcrlC8u0cwwQwps57NbY2eQpYWKzBc8o4cidl8bJbpe9cTYs7ZHTUQ/w185-h400/20260124_190708.jpg" width="185" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A lovely picture from last night</i></td></tr></tbody></table>With no Tana to help, we all lent a hand clearing up the dinner. I think the kids had a grand time when we played charades and hide and seek. We had a lovely time last night - quality time with the family.&nbsp;<br /><div><br /></div><div>Today is <b>Sunday</b>, the guests have left, Tana is away and Suzy is at work and will later have lunch with Oli and Elena at Honest Greens. Thus we are on our own, something that doesn't often happen in this house so we shall enjoy it.</div><div><br /></div><div>That's it for now friends and readers and cheers till next Sunday,</div><div><br /></div><div>Masha</div><div><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>
