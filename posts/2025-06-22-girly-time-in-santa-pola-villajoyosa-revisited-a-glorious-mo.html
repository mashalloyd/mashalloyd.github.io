I can't believe it's Sunday and my lovely girly time in Santa Pola with Adele and Sandra is over. What a wonderful time we had. Girlfriends are so good for me and I already miss my friends.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Last Sunday</b> we still had 4 days left together and made the most of it. It was like being back at University when the world was ours for the taking, except that now we are more mature and a bit better off, haha. I have very few close girlfriends, Amanda, Kathy, Sandra and Adele and I still miss my dearest Spanish friend Fátima. So this last week meant the world to. It was wonderful not to have to worry about putting food on the table at home at strict meal times and having very few responsibilities. We could do what we wanted and when we wanted. It was freedom to feel like a young girl again and oh how we laughed and had such a good time. It was a time for healing one's soul and spirit. Every day we decided together what to do and last Sunday we went to Villajoyosa, one of the prettiest towns on the Costa Blanca. I knew it well in the 70's when my parents had a house in the mountains in Callosa as the bus stopped there always. It was nothing special in those days, just a fishing village with rocky beaches. Today it has changed and the once rocky beach in the centre is now made of sand. I had visited it once with Eladio a few years ago and noticed the change for the better. Its biggest attraction are the coloured houses facing the beach. They were painted different colours so that fishermen returning home could spot theirs. Villajoysa which means "joyous town" lies in between Alicante and Benidorm and is now quite upmarket since it was spruced up and is a desired place to have a house by the sea. Let me show you a few photos of our visit there last week.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihu5MOimjLnJy0cENozydJTUKXtJO86WJHK-sTNMxEeHBscGGs8HPGE84hgGNyeCgNt91Qjgqdk2xZBQwQy7RAR5xKUQiN6iRoHNDwP7kcal4ZwFW9BfIWmNOVSMbAHQN8OAzdQy5hsYVLJpWUrWbGq0dzSfHnMVis7p496EjnwcL4Ri8JK9tjPA/s4000/20250615_105327.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1848" data-original-width="4000" height="185" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEihu5MOimjLnJy0cENozydJTUKXtJO86WJHK-sTNMxEeHBscGGs8HPGE84hgGNyeCgNt91Qjgqdk2xZBQwQy7RAR5xKUQiN6iRoHNDwP7kcal4ZwFW9BfIWmNOVSMbAHQN8OAzdQy5hsYVLJpWUrWbGq0dzSfHnMVis7p496EjnwcL4Ri8JK9tjPA/w400-h185/20250615_105327.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCLsihJ4egaTvxifEfWaYt_NFY0vnssqi7ebvss6DUT9kRGSYctGJV1q8Ch3WIFXaf-nSx968abaiho9D5_XCwvBOTydk7RTbnEFfZn8G5N-8vK5DEE2ES3zsXIF3ZNvRzHJSngHd_-_XoWEXgA_tQ0oRn1Ua8e7MEK9yrO7Q9xK7BlFqyNDoYZw/s4000/20250615_105609.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1848" data-original-width="4000" height="185" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgCLsihJ4egaTvxifEfWaYt_NFY0vnssqi7ebvss6DUT9kRGSYctGJV1q8Ch3WIFXaf-nSx968abaiho9D5_XCwvBOTydk7RTbnEFfZn8G5N-8vK5DEE2ES3zsXIF3ZNvRzHJSngHd_-_XoWEXgA_tQ0oRn1Ua8e7MEK9yrO7Q9xK7BlFqyNDoYZw/w400-h185/20250615_105609.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXeq0drSRZZ_eAJxjUTpcp1fpyWP_cpB4SvFkTuX1UQM1yUu259aOgEY6QMMT_aUC_2pi0fuGF4NsF35ipDnkzxKWnrCELALYysBbb4rkj3RnAVkgnj_JkEc51Ry8n7DIGrvL4EVg-oIx3XzpJAgFDz0-G4L1FuowgOOYGjSqac8gpOmmWEUNGdg/s4000/20250615_105622.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1848" data-original-width="4000" height="185" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjXeq0drSRZZ_eAJxjUTpcp1fpyWP_cpB4SvFkTuX1UQM1yUu259aOgEY6QMMT_aUC_2pi0fuGF4NsF35ipDnkzxKWnrCELALYysBbb4rkj3RnAVkgnj_JkEc51Ry8n7DIGrvL4EVg-oIx3XzpJAgFDz0-G4L1FuowgOOYGjSqac8gpOmmWEUNGdg/w400-h185/20250615_105622.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Pretty Villajoyosa</i></td></tr></tbody></table>It was a hotter day than usual with a lot of haze which never went away during our stay and which apparently came all the way from Canada because of the wild fires there. It was a shame really as I have never experienced such cloudy and hazy weather in this region. Being hot, we chose somewhere in the main square for our morning coffee. I changed my choice for once and ordered an "horchata"- a delicious local cold drink made from tiger nuts which has&nbsp; a very acquired taste. We first tasted it in Callosa all those years ago and I have loved it ever since. Here I took a beautiful photo of beautiful Adele who seems to have grown even more beautiful over the years with her thick curly red hair.<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjc-_h_kpQSufusYvDGBU9uZnwgiTkrKCTvrSRaWOeO12VbKHiLI8cl1XTTXx00BXwaBD71aAPgqx8mLKt5Z2F_on1FG4lz_5QP1F3bT31YHnRvR8_fMfyZfTo0FIMhfHuhfBIlQ4thMl5uJEmvLBRpDs5le5yFXZVKwc6s_jXugFmO2Uh7WeGZaA/s4000/20250615_111133.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="4000" data-original-width="1848" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjc-_h_kpQSufusYvDGBU9uZnwgiTkrKCTvrSRaWOeO12VbKHiLI8cl1XTTXx00BXwaBD71aAPgqx8mLKt5Z2F_on1FG4lz_5QP1F3bT31YHnRvR8_fMfyZfTo0FIMhfHuhfBIlQ4thMl5uJEmvLBRpDs5le5yFXZVKwc6s_jXugFmO2Uh7WeGZaA/w185-h400/20250615_111133.jpg" width="185" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My beautiful Adele</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We then wandered the streets to see the coloured houses up close and loved them.

I needed water desperately and a rest from walking round in such heat. In any case it was time to go home as we were having lunch at the apartment. We stopped at good old Lidl to get some provisions and were sitting down to lunch by about 2.15.<div><br /></div><div>We rested in the afternoon until about 6 when we drove down the beach, determined to get a good walk in. It was hazy and quite full but we still enjoyed it. As usual we walked to "my rock" and back. Once home and after our much needed showers, we ate just fruit and yoghurt for dinner. Then came more games of "sevens" and for once, I won three times in a row hahahah. We went to bed late and I tossed and turned and woke up with the same headache I went to bed with.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Monday</b> came and we agreed to visit Alicante, the beautiful capital town of the area which claims to be the sunniest city in Europe.&nbsp; We didn't go to see the beach or the beautiful Explanade. No, we were on a shopping mission and headed for the main commercial area. We parked at the Corte Inglés, Spain's flagship department store which is always bliss in the heat because it is air conditioned. Frankly we shopped till we dropped. I had to get a new toaster as ours went bust, then it was clothes shopping. I desperately needed a decent bathing costume which had to cover parts it should cover on a lady my age. My dear friends chose them for me and I am so glad&nbsp; I have new ones. These are them.</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhtQmVumVf9UtNrcRT_0lvaVwlp9EI7qyxquBcS9OoSyDDzDSed7kHU0qwBRVpOZlVfhpCFkCQ9oR8Nt5UqqnTm1r0oO_bcO1MvucNez5pShbt32myTzmGSjvPQ1Mbf-5fyfXMO0Yd9t3Z0FhV_y2OroPWLZVvjZ6xGTQ81B397xslKOg7ahrJJwg/s1998/20250617_073118.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1998" data-original-width="1848" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhtQmVumVf9UtNrcRT_0lvaVwlp9EI7qyxquBcS9OoSyDDzDSed7kHU0qwBRVpOZlVfhpCFkCQ9oR8Nt5UqqnTm1r0oO_bcO1MvucNez5pShbt32myTzmGSjvPQ1Mbf-5fyfXMO0Yd9t3Z0FhV_y2OroPWLZVvjZ6xGTQ81B397xslKOg7ahrJJwg/w370-h400/20250617_073118.jpg" width="370" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My lovely new bathing costumes chosen by my dear friends</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div><br /></div><div>I will chuck away all my old ones now. Then we hit Zara (of course) where I got a whole load of mainly white t-shirts. We also got lovely lovely clothes from Zara Kids for our grandchildren. Lunch that day was at Bar Guillermo, recommended to us by a local on the beach. We got there by taxi which was not easy and on the way couldn't find a taxi and had to walk back, thus&nbsp; and totting up more than 10000 steps that day. Bar Guillermo's potato salad was to die for but not much else. I nearly died from the noise it was so loud. We had made a wrong choice and I just wanted to get out. Once back in our car and exhausted we drove home to the quiet and cool of our apartment where we chilled out for the rest of the day and night. We played cards - sevens again and this time I won hands down.&nbsp; We also went down memory lane with Sandra getting out photos of our time at Nottingham University. In the end we all agreed that we looked much better now we are older. Strange right? But true.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>While we were having a girly day shopping, playing cards, reminiscing, etc. on the world scene, Israel was bombarding Teheran' nuclear sites&nbsp; and Iran was bombing Israel.&nbsp; Israel who started the war wants to thwart Iranian military power - especially their possible nuclear bomb - but wow, the war with Gaza has now escalated and who knows what will happen. Many think this is a way to topple the Iranian government. Is that what is going to happen. Meanwhile at the G7, Trump walked out to,&nbsp; supposedly, to monitor what is happening in the Middle East. It's a fine and dangerous mess. He has now told the people of Teheran to evacuate and it was touch and go this week as to whether the&nbsp; US could&nbsp; join the war which may not be popular at home after all his MAGA propaganda.</div><div><br /></div><div>On a nicer note, Monday 16th was Olivia's 2nd wedding anniversary. What a quiet, small and wonderful wedding that was. When I congratulated her, I enclosed a lovely photo of the two of us; a Mother and daughter moment on her big day. This is it.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhgfx9U3OAMEw5w-oznxHlALkdHvbxgTsjBopHVIqwHzLJ8Ap_jvA0CgyrCqmAt45W-Cb6etJpKw3XHPR5UdDnKGtbDulzAQcCWhGrsJkXgmde4CH9m7mazbQwthRxmXSb7t6S4pHms2LpMBxU_f61R_1y7Wk2EOc62s3quZEqUPZ-8wqV9iMEgBg/s1616/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-06-17%20at%2007.20.50_0b3c859c.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1616" data-original-width="1078" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhgfx9U3OAMEw5w-oznxHlALkdHvbxgTsjBopHVIqwHzLJ8Ap_jvA0CgyrCqmAt45W-Cb6etJpKw3XHPR5UdDnKGtbDulzAQcCWhGrsJkXgmde4CH9m7mazbQwthRxmXSb7t6S4pHms2LpMBxU_f61R_1y7Wk2EOc62s3quZEqUPZ-8wqV9iMEgBg/w266-h400/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-06-17%20at%2007.20.50_0b3c859c.jpg" width="266" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>On Olivia's wedding day two years ago this week</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div>Congratulations darling. That day and on Thursday I think Oli had her final exams for her B1 course in French at the local School of languages. She has worked hard on it and of course passed. That meant both Suzy and Eladio had to babysit while she was taking her exams. I got to see some lovely pictures of them with Juliet and Elliot which I want to reproduce here for memory's sake. One day Juliet and Elliot will read this blog and we shall only be memories by then I suppose.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZxGjy9tvVEY1sbEItFZ2Aht9h_njfn0xyGr6wA4wVNwRdcF5vOIfLO8Q2bRNmnS7F_XS0qNF7_I6j-bwYeO_GqDFRVN30TswAhVC46Y04TuFeSA6WZM1nxZvm7OGFO5b_sFAMkEBlWeplxakIn4nJHAXTwv0luW0UbUcsahjF8Wr-b9cavuXEbw/s1600/IMG-20250619-WA0037.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZxGjy9tvVEY1sbEItFZ2Aht9h_njfn0xyGr6wA4wVNwRdcF5vOIfLO8Q2bRNmnS7F_XS0qNF7_I6j-bwYeO_GqDFRVN30TswAhVC46Y04TuFeSA6WZM1nxZvm7OGFO5b_sFAMkEBlWeplxakIn4nJHAXTwv0luW0UbUcsahjF8Wr-b9cavuXEbw/s320/IMG-20250619-WA0037.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj471k8OplJ-u9GK7B8SJhWNUWxIIkLRpdhRZEP852ZOjf0sa6yC9tMed36lTkUoQtEuCFiOQL4EvaCc0MpivwTf2UbwEr1w2fL-BWT9TjuKYv7RkWPGoLxau4mf8tLeu7Dtiry84iQ99GtEUh1MPbsJwI3VqBbPEPAJOYVM0x54KFQ4fDgWK88aQ/s1600/IMG-20250619-WA0039.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="240" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj471k8OplJ-u9GK7B8SJhWNUWxIIkLRpdhRZEP852ZOjf0sa6yC9tMed36lTkUoQtEuCFiOQL4EvaCc0MpivwTf2UbwEr1w2fL-BWT9TjuKYv7RkWPGoLxau4mf8tLeu7Dtiry84iQ99GtEUh1MPbsJwI3VqBbPEPAJOYVM0x54KFQ4fDgWK88aQ/s320/IMG-20250619-WA0039.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEwOgwm1ciPc5IzWlwZzorhMxhxI7mFvqzSSF5GAS1Vv-QRCtyxK4A0z-Z5BpDMBzNdl9lxCkFX7ob-JOZrmjspNzqtsj1Bc5rRrqR_SJSHpIK-FA_v2fhnzKLB6iYALSBRryRO4AVNiqruzKkfFuqmw1OVDegT2T_iU2AY-Rw6GGI48gr8P6fgQ/s1600/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-06-22%20at%2008.09.50_54269c44.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1204" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEwOgwm1ciPc5IzWlwZzorhMxhxI7mFvqzSSF5GAS1Vv-QRCtyxK4A0z-Z5BpDMBzNdl9lxCkFX7ob-JOZrmjspNzqtsj1Bc5rRrqR_SJSHpIK-FA_v2fhnzKLB6iYALSBRryRO4AVNiqruzKkfFuqmw1OVDegT2T_iU2AY-Rw6GGI48gr8P6fgQ/w301-h400/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-06-22%20at%2008.09.50_54269c44.jpg" width="301" /></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Suzy and Eladio picking the kids up from school and Eladio in the watet with them this week.&nbsp;</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Eladio hardly ever goes in the pool so this week was something of an occasion hahaha.<br /><div><br /></div><div><b>Tuesday</b> came, our last full day but one together and we decided not to make any plans.

I had some work to do but mostly read on the terrace until it was time for our favourite card game; Sevens. I love it because it is so relaxing. I think on Tuesday I was the most relaxed I have been in a very long time. This break has done me so much good.</div><div><br /></div><div>We were in bed early and I was up even earlier on<b> Wednesday</b> morning - at 05.30 damn! We had a long and pleasurable day ahead of us. At 10 am we had an appointment at a local salon to have our nails done. That's such a girly thing isn't it? It was run by a Chinese man who did Adele's nails. Mine were done by a young South American boy and Sandra's by a buxom black lady. I have to say they were very good as were the prices. Mine cost only 8 euros!</div><div><br /></div><div>We then wandered round the main street looking at more clothes shops. I took the opportunity to call in on our electrician who had done the rewiring here. I needed a certificate from them to give to our electricity supplier to increase the voltage here.Well he wasn't there and I was told they would send it to me during the day. I didn't hear anything more until very late in the day.Bottom line was I had to get out cash to pay him before I got the certificate. Blimey I thought.He came the next day for his money. They did a good job but were very slow.</div><div><br /></div><div>With the electrician out of my mind, I joined my girlies and bought myself a pretty white dress and some pink and white striped shorts for Oli, We had coffee by the port and for lack of a photo of the three of us for this blog, I got the waitress to take photos.

By about 7 we were out, all dressed up for a walk and dinner. I took my friends to my happy place walk at the end of the old coastal road from our place to Santa Pola. I parked the car at the end and we walked on the Promenade called Vice Admiral Blanco García.

We were all packed and first I had to take Sandra to the airport as her flight was at 08.30. Adele's wasn't till 1 pm. On my way back I had to get the tires pumped at the garage and get out another 1000 euros for Sandro, the electrician who was coming to get his money before he left. Only then would he give us the coveted electricity certificate enabling us to increase the capacity in the flat. He was a blessing in a way as he and his nephew mended the mosquito net on one of the windows and helped us bring down all our luggage. I left dear Adele at the airport and was off by 10. I wasn't looking forward to the long drive home with so many lorries to overtake on the various motorways. I stopped a few times and was finally home by just after 3pm. There waiting for me were Suzy, Eladio, Pips and Tana. There were 3 Colombian guests but I only met Daniela. It was great to be home but oh so hot at over 34ºc so thank God for air con. I gave out my presents to Suzy and Eladio. She got some short pyjamas from Women's Secret and a note book from Ale Hope (love that shop). Eladio got some new summer espadrilles. It took me over an hour to unpack and settle in but I couldn't sleep.</div><div><br /></div><div>Oli and the kids joined us at around 5.15 and I gave them their pressies. Elliot got swimming trunks from Zara and a drawing pad from Ale Hop - he is so good at drawing. Juliet got a pretty matching top and shorts and there were pink and cream striped shorts for Oli. I must add the talking parrot from Ale Hop hahahaha; how I love those things.</div><div><br /></div><div>Soon we were in the pool, the only place to be in that weather. I went in for once and wore my new red bathing costume. My darling husband kept taking photos of me in it and said it was very sexy. It isn't or maybe it is but I'm not hahaha. But bless him. Oli had brought back a giant floating Unicorn for the pool from Copi's hen party which added to the fun. Here are some pics to remember Thursday afternoon with our grandchildren, Elliot and Juliet soon to be 4 and 6.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjmJdBjBLedNTlyJ9f1Qs6yT6WHJ_hGtQnwJzqDpfXDYYp4Kp2lGLttgF4DSUrtEF7tzhBZ-gDN9ceQZe213rOvAC3ae5YnQSXwPpgmy2GCTeqUosk_8nlXgueEV3pKm0ReDSkOzn1GMyx2e94LidkjmpbgPvml6-xuxrN6zu0GVqMzIsslcLjWmQ/s4000/20250619_183503.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1848" data-original-width="4000" height="185" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjmJdBjBLedNTlyJ9f1Qs6yT6WHJ_hGtQnwJzqDpfXDYYp4Kp2lGLttgF4DSUrtEF7tzhBZ-gDN9ceQZe213rOvAC3ae5YnQSXwPpgmy2GCTeqUosk_8nlXgueEV3pKm0ReDSkOzn1GMyx2e94LidkjmpbgPvml6-xuxrN6zu0GVqMzIsslcLjWmQ/w400-h185/20250619_183503.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghBbWa-yAvRdzVZ2zwTlbvDvvjP7TmRknMp11tXxa-fl_TBxXTEsh_0IDf5Uq84p-eUtLzzy1Zia179V89z6tXWGOnMCx_7aLCrU8u2ruw_acTEE3DrVoMZsYvOyM9bYvGRj7re94VztVJhgcNYXGhhpEcx-tGLjxvw33U9fRKQPvPdAMMaLXRlA/s4000/20250619_185710.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1848" data-original-width="4000" height="185" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghBbWa-yAvRdzVZ2zwTlbvDvvjP7TmRknMp11tXxa-fl_TBxXTEsh_0IDf5Uq84p-eUtLzzy1Zia179V89z6tXWGOnMCx_7aLCrU8u2ruw_acTEE3DrVoMZsYvOyM9bYvGRj7re94VztVJhgcNYXGhhpEcx-tGLjxvw33U9fRKQPvPdAMMaLXRlA/w400-h185/20250619_185710.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjz98xgSncsOIORKVBJhaHPjXqkgNHt67Gl1B-D-FxbLm6MneMbWKVCLL55skXZ5oAHyQ0JjNpD1qdo9rTwvNItvyMZSwFm7E0z4kX3Pw6-HFDQK3v4NzG2Se2433yK9dfQkCra_YdjOo3Pgm53c_r_CBilMF7pBvTAF6YJzexssfjj_DMYVsI-Iw/s1600/IMG-20250619-WA0040.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img border="0" data-original-height="1200" data-original-width="1600" height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjz98xgSncsOIORKVBJhaHPjXqkgNHt67Gl1B-D-FxbLm6MneMbWKVCLL55skXZ5oAHyQ0JjNpD1qdo9rTwvNItvyMZSwFm7E0z4kX3Pw6-HFDQK3v4NzG2Se2433yK9dfQkCra_YdjOo3Pgm53c_r_CBilMF7pBvTAF6YJzexssfjj_DMYVsI-Iw/w400-h300/IMG-20250619-WA0040.jpg" width="400" /></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Fun swimming time with the family on Thursday after I got back from Santa Pola</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div>Would you believe that Adele also arrived home to 34ºc in Brittany in Northern France?&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Oli and family stayed for dinner and it was a makeshift meal, part of it being my sandwiches for the journey which I never ate and which went down well.</div><div><br /></div><div>Damn it by the way as I left my Kindle in SP. Thank you Olivia for lending me yours. Without it I cannot fall asleep at night. It's the best way for me.</div><div><br /></div><div>I slept so so with the air con nearly all the night and was up around 6.30 I think. <b>Friday</b> was busy. I went shopping with Eladio to fill our cupboards which had emptied in my absence. While out we also had our usual coffee at Manacor. Suzy did not join us for lunch that day as she had to go to her weekly group therapy session. She was very down when I got back from SP but since then has perked up just a little bit. Once again we were joined by Oli and the kids for a swim in the afternoon after which they joined us for a scrumptious dinner.&nbsp; Oh boy I slept really badly that night and got just under 4.5h sleep which had me feeling like a zombie on <b>Saturday</b>.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Saturday was the highlight of the week; José Antonio and Dolores were coming for lunch and Suzy and I went out bikini shopping in the morning. Before I left I made sure lunch was in order with Tana's help. I prepared home made salmorejo for our first course. The second course was roast chicken thighs with roast red peppers and Tana's wonderful rice. Dessert was figs with thick black cherries.</div><div><br /></div><div>Suzy and I went to Centro Oeste to buy her two bikinis. She found one at Etam and a beautiful red one at Calzadonia. She looked stunning in both. From there we went to my health centre to get a prescription and then to have a coffee at Alverán, like old times. We had a bit of a tête a tête and Suzy told me she wants to take up her career in Nutrition and Dietetics again - thankfully she will not be doing the course to become a massage therapist. Her idea is to do a Masters in Nutritional Coaching. That would be just great. Later she thanked me for a wonderful day. It was wonderful also thanks to Oli who took her for lunch to a veggie restaurant while Miguel took the kids to his mother's place for lunch.</div><div><br /></div><div>While Tana and I were finishing preparing lunch, Eladio went to fetch his brother and sister-in-law at the local metro station. They arrived by 1, an hour before lunch, which we spent by the pool. Of note I was the only one to go in the water. It was so hot yesterday I could have spent the whole day in the pool. Lunch was magnificent; a bit too much for me. I think that the Mounjaro drug I am taking is not really reducing my appetite as much as at the beginning. I ate and felt rather full.Later I had hardly any dinner to compensate.</div><div><br /></div><div>We spent the whole afternoon by the pool and were joined later by Suzy dressed in her new red bikini. She spent quite a lot of time with us which is a good sign she is retreating from her hermit like existence.&nbsp; We all had one of the many ice creams I had bought for Juliet and Elliot which I think everyone appreciated. Here are the two brothers enjoying theirs haha.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiChOaH6qnfiInWd9YwYHeSvDNUVG4uU2SnFJsUJHX-MOh2H2neIHjBUgwFLDZF5Ih1_cAtVxbXlL3W7hg-jaFNNBPnZUyaV_oyslPzam0Q1vOZ4cYxNUcZIFJxOgS4Dws1EuDH5ve4ENzbSzQES1CVJsnxaUkt80suQ6OCSTYezfYktQhCPE03nQ/s2000/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-06-22%20at%2007.58.40_1cd4d2b0.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="924" data-original-width="2000" height="185" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiChOaH6qnfiInWd9YwYHeSvDNUVG4uU2SnFJsUJHX-MOh2H2neIHjBUgwFLDZF5Ih1_cAtVxbXlL3W7hg-jaFNNBPnZUyaV_oyslPzam0Q1vOZ4cYxNUcZIFJxOgS4Dws1EuDH5ve4ENzbSzQES1CVJsnxaUkt80suQ6OCSTYezfYktQhCPE03nQ/w400-h185/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-06-22%20at%2007.58.40_1cd4d2b0.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Ice cream time in the heat. Two brothers enjoying theirs while Pippa looks on.</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div>Yesterday, of course, was the Summer Solstice, the longest day of the year and the beginning of summer. That meant it got dark at around 10.30 pm - wow. Toño and Dolores left around 8.30 after which we had a very scanty dinner before retiring to our quarters to watch the news and fall asleep.</div><div><br /></div><div>Today <b>Sunday</b>, I woke up the terrifying news that Trump had bombarded three or 4 Iranian nuclear plants. This came as a terrible and very worrying surprise. He had said he would take a decision whether to intervene on the side of Israel who was the first to attack Iranian nuclear plants.&nbsp; But he went and did it in secret and surprised the world. Iran will be furious. I hate to think of the repercussions. I wonder too what Trump's voters will think as he promised peace and MAGA. He hasn't kept his promise. Of course, Netanyahu is delighted to have him as an ally to destroy the Iranian capability to build nuclear weapons.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>On a brighter note, Carlos Alcaraz, the amazing Spanish tennis player from Murcia, is through to the finals at Queens, the precursor to Wimbledon. He won the latter in both 2023 and 2024. Can he do it again and make a hat trick? With the permission of Djokovic and Sinner and if he is on good form, no doubt he can. We will see.</div><div><br /></div><div>I shall leave you now to get on with the day, most of which I shall spend in the pool to cool off as today promises to be yet another scorcher with the temperature rising to 35ºc, just one degree&nbsp; less than yesterday.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Next week our dear friends Amanda and Andy will be coming to stay and we shall be taking them north to both Montrondo and our other house in Asturias, to get away from the heat and for them to see the real Spain. We are going to have so much fun which you will read about in next Sunday's blog post.</div><div><br /></div><div>Meanwhile I wish you all the best for this week.
