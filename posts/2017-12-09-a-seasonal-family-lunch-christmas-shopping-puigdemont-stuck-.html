<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Good morning all from Montrondo!</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Here I am in our village with Eladio, Oli, her boyfriend Miguel and Pippa on the last day of our stay here for the Bank Holiday which is known in Spain as the "puente de la constitución". This is the longest bank holiday in the year as it encompasses 2 holidays, Constitution Day on 6th December and the Immaculate Conception on 8th December. A lot of people like us will have been on holiday from Wednesday to Sunday and others will have taken the whole week off.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">But let me start at the beginning, from last Sunday. That day I was up extra early at 5.30 and after publishing my blog, I began making lunch as we had visitors that day, Eladio's brother José Antonio, his wife, my sister-in-law, Dolores, their daughter, partner and little boy as well as their daughter-in-law, Claudia and her Mother Reina from Cuba were coming and it would be full house.  It was Reina's first time outside Cuba and she was overwhelmed by our consumer society. I can well understand her as, having been to Cuba, I know just how little they have and how much we have. It is an unfair comparison. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I started off making my multi cereal bread and for the main meal, my famous chicken Korma curry with rice. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Just as I was making my quasi Indian dish, I was joined by our   Indian guest, Nisar, who was staying with the family from Galicia (Nigran in Vigo)  who had reserved our house on Home Away when they came for a wedding in Boadilla last weekend. She is such a lovely girl and had lived in Spain with the family on an exchange 2 years ago and learned Spanish perfectly. However, she and I spoke in English. She told me that in her family their main language was English and that her Hindi was really bad which sort of surprised me. From Bombay, aged 21 she is a student of journalism. She seemed to me a very modern young Indian Muslim girl with all the right values. I asked her opinion on my curry and she politely said it smelled very good hahaha.  I was sad to see her leave when the family left that morning and had to have a photo with her before they left. It's not a good one but one to remember her by.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I had everything ready for the lunch by 12 so there was time for a walk before our guests arrived. Eladio, the dogs and I were joined by Oli who unfortunately couldn't stay for the family lunch as she had a prior engagement. It was a glorious sunny morning. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I came home to lay the table and just as everything was ready our guests arrived. As our Christmas decorations were all up it felt like a Christmas family lunch which it was really, except that curry is not very Christmassy hahaha. Zena, our weekend carer who is from the Ukraine, had made the first course,  a Russian dish called "glouptsy" (stuffed cabbage rolls) which everyone loved. They loved the curry too. Dolores had brought "pudding", her home made apple cake which we all devoured. With heaving stomachs, we withdrew to the lounge after lunch where everything was really cozy thanks to our Christmas display. It's all a bit kitsch I'm sure but I love it.  Dolores' grandson who is only 2 loved the display, as well as all my ornaments but he behaved beautifully. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We were not hungry at all but at 5 I served "afternoon tea" which seemed very fitting in our quasi British, Spanish and Russian home hahahah. It was great to have Reina (means Queen in English) visit us as we had met her at Miguel and Claudia's wedding in Cuba last January. I hope she felt at home with us. Before our guests left, I remembered to have a photo taken to recall the occasion. And here we are, the 4 women, Reina, Claudia, Dolores and I by our Christmas tree. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Soon after they left, Oli came back from her lunch with her friend Anita. We had time on our hands before eating again hahahaha, and we sat in our lounge with the lovely Christmas atmosphere and played ludo. For the record I won!  Dinner was a very small affair as none of us were hungry. Being Sunday night we watched the Jordi Evole programme where he interviewed 2 Catalan women politicians; Ines Arrimadas from the relatively new central democratic party, Ciudadanos, and Marta Rovira, a separatist from the ERC party. The former beat the latter hands down. I only hope she does so too in the elections on 21st December.  All in all, it had been a lovely day. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Monday I was up at 6 am. It was to be my main Christmas shopping day. I had already bought some of the presents online and at the weekend been with Oli to Gran Plaza Norte. I wanted to go to Primark and Tiger and avoid the weekend crowds. On Monday everything was more organised and there were far fewer shoppers. It was much easier to shop at Primark and here I did most of my Christmas shopping for the men in our house. I also got nearly all the stocking fillers for the girls at Tiger, a shop I love. I couldn't resist getting more Christmas decorations for the house there too as well as for Montrondo. I got the girls presents at Zara and it was here that I spied a beautiful dark green velvet trouser suit; something I have always wanted. I adore green and I adore velvet and when I saw this outfit, I just had to have it. It would be my Christmas present from my Father for me hahahaha. Aren't I lucky. This is it. You can see it online <a href="https://www.google.es/search?q=zara+woman+green+velvet+trouser+suit&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=qfF7i_DFt9OUbM%253A%252C61x07a5pF2snsM%252C_&amp;usg=__vocpGo0m0IfS-3m_ZBGtD-tHQ9k%3D&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ4bXnlPfXAhXG0xQKHatHCDkQ9QEINjAD#imgrc=qfF7i_DFt9OUbM">here</a>. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I still can't decide whether to wrap it up and put in under the tree with the other presents or to wear it to the ex Yoigo Christmas party next week. In the end I think I shall wear it to the party and then wrap it up and put it under the tree haha. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I came home to have lunch with the men and then spent the most part of the afternoon wrapping up all the Christmas presents. I also went on our walk with Eladio and the dogs and it got a bit dark at the end. I can't wait for the days to be longer. After the winter solstice on 21st December the days will slowly get longer thank goodness. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">On Tuesday morning I did more Christmas present shopping but online this time. I have nearly finished the task with just a few things still to get. That morning I went to the hairdresser as my roots were showing and it was time to get them dyed. What a bore. While waiting for them to dye, I had half an hour to read the hairdresser glossy magazines. I also had time to order vital British Christmas items online from the <a href="https://www.britishcornershop.co.uk/">British Corner Shop</a>. Here I got a Christmas pudding, cranberry sauce and Paxo sage and onion stuffing. Christmas day lunch wouldn't be the same without these. I also got more crackers as well as chocolates; a Cadbury's selection box and a box of Roses which we all love. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I was home on time for our walk - another glorious sunny day - followed by lunch with the men of leftovers. In the afternoon Eladio and I went food shopping, mostly to get provisions for Montrondo and to leave enough food in the house for Lucy and my Father. Oli and Miguel were coming to spend the night before we left together for Montrondo the next day. So I made a special dinner with the giant prawns I had bought at Mercadona. I cooked them, peeled every one of them (what a job) and made prawn cocktail in individual glass dishes. I did it in layers starting with lettuce, then fresh pineapple, avocado and finally the prawns which were topped with what we used to call at home "thousand island sauce". This is what they looked like. I think I will be repeating the experience and serving them to the family for our Christmas Eve dinner. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">While I was in the throes of cooking,  concentrating on making the prawn cocktail, little did I know the dogs were in the lounge attacking the Christmas tree. Norah, the beagle, will have been the culprit although I didn't see them. But I did see the result; the knocked over Christmas tree after they had gone for the chocolate decorations at the top of it. It had fallen all over the presents, tearing a lot of the wrapping paper. They had also climbed over the piano to get to a chocolate Father Christmas figure on the window sill, knocking off lots of ornaments from a glass trolley we have in the lounge. What a mess they left with stuff strewn all over the place. Lucy came to the rescue and together we put everything back. There are no chocolate decorations left and I won't be buying any more hahahha. I have learned my lesson. Naughty dogs! I was furious. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We had a beautiful dinner together after which Eladio and I watched the news. One of the items reported didn't surprise me. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/winter-sports/42242007">Russia had been banned</a> by the IOC from the 2018 Winter Olympic Games for doping. I think justice has been done there. But it's a big blow for Russia.  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">What did surprise me was the news of the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/winter-sports/42242007">withdrawal of the European extradition warrant</a> for Puigdemont, the former Catalan leader who fled to Brussels to avoid facing court in Spain for crimes of sedition, rebellion, disobedience, prevarication and embezzlement.  It's funny how if you are a member of the EU you can escape justice by fleeing to another country within the block. There's something wrong with the system there. Judge Pablo Llarena had decided to withdraw the warrant for a particular reason. In the Belgian legal system, crimes of sedition and rebellion do not exist whereas they do in Spain and are the ones that would give a longer sentence. Thus if Puigdemont were to be judged in Belgium he would be given a lighter sentence than his counterparts in Spain which would be unfair to them.  This means that from now on he is free in Belgium and in the rest of the world but it also means that if he steps one foot on Spanish or Catalan soil, he would be detained. So in a way he is exiled and stuck in Belgium for the moment. He claims he went there to "internationalise" his cause yet very recently  criticised the EU for being an undemocratic group of countries and even proposed  a referendum for leaving it, now dubbed "Catelix".  From the Belgian capital, believe it or not, he is participating in the Catalan Elections as a candidate. I think he is a coward and should never have left Spain. While he is galavanting in the European capital, his number two, Oriol Junqueras, is in prison in Madrid.  </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Wednesday 6th December was Spain's Constitution Day. But it was also the 100th anniversary of Finland's Independence Day. Finland has a big place in my heart after all the years I worked for Nokia and Nokia is a big symbol of Finland. My friends there had much to celebrate. A 100 years ago the country declared independence from Russia. Since 1809 it had formed an autonomous grand duchy in the Russian Empire but all that came to an end in 1917 thanks to the Bolshevik Revolution. Before that it had been under Swedish rule since the 13th century. When the Russian revolution took place, Finland was able to declare independence as the union between the two neighbours lost its legal base and Finnish independence was later recognised by Lenin and his government. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">While documenting this information, I remembered that one of my ancestors had been the Governor General of Finland when it still formed the Grand Duchy and belonged to Russia. So I searched the web and found out that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Aleksandrovich_Stakhovich">Mikhail Aleksandrovich Stakhovich</a> was appointed Governor General of Finland by the Russian Provisional Government on March 20th 1917. Wikipedia tells me he resigned on September 17. Born in 1861, he was  a Russian politician in the times of Tzar Nicholas II and he died in Aix-en-Provence in France in 1923, obviously in exile like all of my Mother's family.  So how is he my ancestor you may ask? Good question. Well, my Grandmother was a Stachovich and there is only one Stachovich family, a noble Russian family. Her mother was a R</span><span style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">ibeaupierre and her father a Stachovich.  She, of course, married a <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/gotha/gotha/lieven.html">Lieven,</a> my grandfather, Prince Andrei Lieven. I would love to know what their relationship was. They will have known each other as she (Sophie Stachovich) was born in 1886 in St. Petersburg. This is the only photo I could find of the last but one Governor General of Finland. I wonder what he would have thought about Finland's celebration of 100 years of independence. </span></span><br></br>

<span style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">With these thoughts in my mind, I started packing for our trip to Montrondo. We had to take food to last the 4 of us until Sunday so the Volvo was pretty full when we left. There was lots of traffic and when we reached the province of Valladolid, we encountered frost, fog and freezing temperatures. We stopped at Rueda, an hour later than usual owing to the traffic, at about 13h for out traditional pit stop to enjoy the wine and ham there. I was starving as I hadn't eaten since breakfast at 6 in the morning. </span></span></div>

Even so it wasn't very warm and he had to put the fire on. He should really have done it the night before. Later that night the house was much warmer and ever since with both the central heating and the fire on, it feels like being in a sauna. The maximum temperature outside though hasn't risen above 5c since we came!</span></div>

Oli and I wore boots which crunched in the snow while Pippa walked on the side of the path hahaha. Apart from a group of neighbours we chatted to when we left the house, we never saw another soul. The Constitution Bank holiday usually forms crowds everywhere but, thankfully, not in Montrondo. It was freezing cold and we were well wrapped up. However there was some ice on the road and I was very cautious given that a couple of years ago I slipped on ice in the snow here in the mountains and broke my leg. Both Oli and I had a narrow escape walking up a small road in Murias on our way back. I nearly slipped so in the end decided to cross it on my backside which was a very funny moment. </span></span></div>

In the photo I am wearing my new 10 euro Scottish tartan Primark winter pyjamas which I love.</span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; text-align: left;">While the chicken was cooking in the oven, I made yet another Christmas purchase online. On Thursday I bought a "ramo leonés", (literally tree branch from León, the province we are in and the province where Eladio was born). I was inspired after seeing one in Manolita's house when I went there to get some bread I had asked her to buy us the day we arrived. I had often seen this typical Christmas decoration in León, especially at Eladio's sister's house and decided I wanted one to respect Eladio's roots. I couldn't decide whether to buy it for Montrondo or for our house in Madrid. </span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">It stars Vanessa Redgrave who plays <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fania_F%C3%A9nelon">Fania Fenelon</a>, a half Jewish pianist, composer and singer who was born in Paris and was of Russian descent. She was a very strong character who wrote a diary during her terrible years at the hands of the Nazis and later wrote a book of the same name as the film. I shall be downloading it soon. I was very affected by the brutality of it afterwards and remarked to Olivia that my generation are fully aware of the Second World War and what the Nazis did but unfortunately today's generation are not. Thank goodness though, there are many films and books to document the reality of what happened. </span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">As I was watching the film about hate, 45.000 Catalan separatist supporters had flown to Brussels to rally for independence and for the EU to "wake up", as if it wasn't already awake. They also went, in a way, like the Nazi supporters, to show their hate for the rest of Spain and their criticism of the European Union which in my mind exists to avoid wars like World War II. The Spanish Vice President, Soraya Sainz de Santa María, reminded them that they were able to travel to Brussels, the capital of the EU, precisely because they have Spanish citizenship and because Spain belongs to the EU, meaning that if Catalonia became independent, it would not obviously not belong. I wish they had watched the same film I had instead of showing their hate in Brussels. </span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Miguel and Oli, meanwhile, made a delicious lemon and coconut
sponge cake. I am not a sponge cake fan but it was very tasty. We had another cozy dinner together after which we watched the news. The most important news was that Donald Trump had announced the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/06/donald-trump-us-jerusalem-israel-capital">US would recognise Jerusalem as the Israeli capital</a>, provoking outrage around the world, especially from Palestine and Muslim countries . He described the decision as a "long overdue step" to advance the Middle East peace process but he has done precisely the opposite as the</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"> "fate of the ancient city is one of the thorniest issues between Israel
and Palestine".  We can all now prepare for more "jihadist" attacks on the west; that will be the outcome of Donald Trump's decision; not peace. The guy is crazy. </span><br></br>
<span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="background-color: white; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">On Thursday evening 7 guests from Vigo (again) who had booked 3 rooms in our house on Airbnb, were checking into our house for 2 nights. Lucy would be receiving them and I was a little nervous we weren't there. I could only hope that everything would turn out o.k. </span><br></br>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: normal; margin-top: 12pt;">
<span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">On Friday I was awake at 5 a.m. but forced myself to stay in bed until 5.30. It was the second holiday of the week, this time to celebrate the Immaculate Conception. Spain is a lay state these days but religious traditions die hard. After another delicious breakfast, I prepared our lunch and made "bacalao a la riojana" (cod made the Rioja way with peppers and onions) and at about 11 am. we were ready to leave for the nearby mining town, Villablino to visit the Friday open market there. It had rained all night and the snow was all but gone and it would rain throughout the rest of our stay robbing us of our walks in the sun. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: normal; margin-top: 12pt;">
<span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Once in wet and empty Villablino we went to have a coffee at the Selene Cafeteria but there were no accompanying cakes or pastries this time. We were told the chef was on holiday. From there we walked to the open air market, only stopping to visit a big cheapo Chinese shop to buy some tarpaulin for the balcony of our house which apparently has a leak. Oli and Miguel bought lots of Christmas decorations for their flat in Madrid. There was not much to be had at the market and all the other shops, apart from the Chinese one, were closed. We made a beeline for Benigna's stall where she sells local produce. We bought honey, walnuts, ginormous onions and garlic, etc and somehow, don't ask me how I lost both the walnuts and honey during the process. I was buying stuff for my sister-in-law and Oli and Miguel were buying stuff too so maybe I left my bags at the stall. Who knows? So my visit to the market was not very fruitful. Eladio, Miguel and Oli also wanted to buy chorizo and cheese from one of the other stalls. Chorizo is a famous Spanish sausage but I'm not that keen on it considering it a little over rated hahaha. And here is Olivia making her purchases.</span></div>

<span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We drove home in the gloomy weather and soon were sitting down to lunch. Meanwhile Eladio's second brother down, José Antonio, had arrived from Madrid with his wife, Dolores, his son Miguel, Miguel's Cuban wife, Claudia and her Mother, Reina who I wrote about last year. Reina, I'm sure, was hoping to find snow in Montrondo as she has never seen it first hand ever but unfortunately it had gone because of the rain by the time they arrived. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: normal; margin-top: 12pt;">
<span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">They came for coffee after lunch. Another nephew, Roberto, his wife Ana and their little girls had arrived in the village too and they also joined us. Soon we had a big family gathering around Eladio's enormous and very warm fire which had the room feeling like a sauna.</span></div>

<span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">When everyone left, most of them to take a siesta, Oli, Miguel and I played Monopoly. A couple of years ago I had bought a vintage first edition John Waddington set online from a collector dated 1935 and it was the first time we were to use it. And here are Oli and Miguel beginning to play.</span></div>

<span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I got it for a song from the collector. It has been used but is in good condition. For Miguel it was the first time he had played on a London street board. For me it brought back memories of playing as a child at Christmas at my Aunty Gloria's house in London. No one won as the game went on too long as it often does. It was our alternative to going for a walk in the rain. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: normal; margin-top: 12pt;">
<span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I made dinner because it was dinner time that evening but I was not hungry after no exercise. Later we watched a film on Netflix but I slept throughout. There is something about sitting down on the sofa after dinner in front of the TV with a fire burning that just brings on the slumber.  </span></div>

<span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I rose on Saturday at 6 am. We would be returning to Villablino, this time to go to the supermarket there, Gadis, not because we were in great need of food but to stock up with provisions for home and because we all, that is, Dolores, Oli and I, are great fans of this supermarket which only exists in the north of Spain. </span><br></br>

<span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">It was raining non-stop again as it has done since Friday morning, while on the other side of the world, in California, 6 large wildfires are raging. The Governor of California blamed climate change and extreme weather conditions. Some 200.000 people have been forced to leave their homes and 500 or more homes have been destroyed and turned to ashes. How dreadful.</span><br></br>

<span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We left for Villablino as soon as we had had breakfast and made a beeline for Gadis. While shopping, Reina, Claudia's mother who was on her first trip outside Cuba, remarked that she felt dizzy. She wasn't ill, no, she was dizzy from so much produce on sale. She told us she had never seen anything like it and that she was amazed at the range of products and the range of prices. Isn't life unfair for some people? We stocked up mostly on provisions to take home to Madrid and when we had all checked out, went to have a drink together.</span><br></br>

<span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We were home by 13.45. I quickly finished making lunch, including fillet steak I had bought at Gadis. Later we went for coffee to Toño's house to join the rest of the family. Another of Eladio's brothers had come from León, Alejandro who is often called "el músico" (the musician) as he plays the accordion. He played a few songs for us and as always, added a magic ingredient to the family atmosphere. Funnily enough his music made me start yawning and I had to have a siesta where I was joined by Pippa.</span><br></br>
<span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I came downstairs an hour later and, being on my own, decided to start watching season 2 of The Crown on Netflix. But soon the others came down and no one else wanted to watch it so I had to leave it to watch sometime later on my own of course. My family are not particularly interested in the British Royal family hahahaa. Well, why should they be?</span><br></br>
<span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="background-color: transparent; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Instead, I played cards with Miguel and Olivia. We played "sevens" called "cinquillo" here until it was time for dinner. I don't think any of us were hungry, probably because we had had no exercise. Because of the insistent rain we were robbed of our daily walks and it was now 3 days in a row that we hadn't got one. Meanwhile, on the Costa Blanca, people were bathing in the sea. I reflected that maybe we should have gone to Santa Pola instead of Montrondo for the bank holiday:-(</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: normal; margin-top: 12pt;">
<div class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">And today is Sunday and our last day in Montrondo. Once again I have woken up to rain.

There will also be</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"> the added problem of what is being dubbed "Storm Ana" here, a weather bomb bringing torrential rain which the meteorologists call an "explosive cyclogenesis".  So wish us luck on our journey back.</span></div>
