Many of you reading this blog post will be familiar with the wine but I wonder if after reading this, that I may have whetted your appetite to actually visit the area which I sincerely recommend you do one day. Put it on your bucket list if you haven't already been here. </div><p style="text-align: justify;">It has been a very full week so let me rewind to start from last Sunday. This time last week marked the end of our stay in Montrondo. It was hot, 30ºc and an unbelievable 41ºc in Madrid. We were not looking forward to coming home. The heatwave which began over a week ago is now receding but I don't remember it ever having been as hot as this. I reported last week that in Spain the highest temperature ever recorded was in a town in Córdoba when mercury reached over 47ºc. Most of southern Europe has been sweltering and we all attribute it to climate change. So, I was surprised to read that the current highest temperature ever recorded in Europe was in 1977 when mercury reached 48ºc somewhere in Greece. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">The heatwave continued in the news as did Covid. Once again, I start my Sunday blog post reporting on the lastest figures worldwide. If this time last week the total number of those infected and those who died was 202.987.420 and 4.299.760, today these figures stand at 212.165.567 and 4.436.957. So, yes, once again, the numbers are going up. Here in Spain or in my little bubble somehow I feel immune not necessarily to the virus but to the news. We have never caught it, we have lived through tough restrictions and come out safe and life seems relatively normal, except that it isn't. On the plus side we really can do nearly anything we want so I feel lucky.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">On Sunday morning last week I was up early and by about 11.15 or so we were all packed into Oli and Miguel's big station wagon type car with so much stuff it looked like a gypsy caravan inside. Eladio drove, Oli was the co pilot and I sat in the back with Pippa at my feet and Elliot in his car seat next to me. I was surrounded by all his stuff and the journey was not to be smooth I'm afraid.  We were stopping in León, the capital of the province, to see Eladio's 99 year old mother at her care home. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">We had last seen her in May and that was the first time in a year so my husband was looking forward to a reunion. I was looking forward to seeing my mother-in-law but above all I wanted her to see her great grandson, Elliot. We arrived just a few minutes late as it was damned difficult to find anywhere to park. The idea was to take her out for a coffee so we could all be with her as otherwise only 2 people are allowed inside. We parked and Eladio rushed to get his mother only to be told it was nearly her lunchtime and he only had 20 minutes. Meanwhile Oli, Elliot and I were waiting at a designated cafe only to receive a call from Eladio to go quickly to the care home if we wanted to see his mother. That wasn't easy. It was boiling hot, our car was far and Oli, being nearly 9 months pregnant walks very slowly not to mention Elliot with his little legs. I got there first and was allowed in to the visiting lounge. The window was open so we wheeled Ernestina to the window to see Elliot and Oli who had just arrived but couldn't come in. We were "caught" by a member of staff who went ballistic. She said it was against the rules even to take a resident to a window to see relatives! I couldn't believe it. It made no sense that she could go out and see as many people as she wanted yet only 2 can come in and she is not allowed to go to a window to see people. I mean how stupid is that. With little Elliot waving at his great grandmother who was being dragged away, I'm afraid I burst into tears. I was too distraught to argue with the staff who were more interested in their resident getting her lunch on time than seeing her far off relatives. I didn't like the way they referred to her either when they called her "this one" saying she was happy and easy to feed. I think she would have been far happier to go outside with us and have her lunch late. It was just too much for me and for us all. Thus, no photo to record this very disappointing visit. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">As we left León, I rang a few places on the way to book a table for lunch but it was mission impossible. Sunday 15th August is perhaps one of the busiest days for the hospitality industry. It is the middle of the high season but also 15th August is the Feast of the Assumption and  a bank holiday. Oli suggested we eat in León and found us a restaurant she though was   a cider house but it turned out to be an "oriental" restaurant, a quaisi one at that. The food was nothing special and I didn't particularly like much on the menu but then again I am something of a fussy eater. Elliot was happy mostly about an old red scooter in the dining room which was there for decoration.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEitWyrxxOE3SKDVSKPj04muCTP6Jz98FYwPwzGWHxaXyurk0zb4OwSh3CF-1YC8e5SLBKbinnpWmA9ee5-6irpTjW_wd9_PDnHurK53KU84qGE8r4sAMAIQ3q0GQNlhEd5KiP_4Ow/s2048/Sun+E+and+E+rest+Le%25C3%25B3n.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="295" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEitWyrxxOE3SKDVSKPj04muCTP6Jz98FYwPwzGWHxaXyurk0zb4OwSh3CF-1YC8e5SLBKbinnpWmA9ee5-6irpTjW_wd9_PDnHurK53KU84qGE8r4sAMAIQ3q0GQNlhEd5KiP_4Ow/w400-h295/Sun+E+and+E+rest+Le%25C3%25B3n.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Elliot with his grandfather, Eladio, at the restaurant in León where we had lunch last Sunday on our way home. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">We were out by about 3.30 and resumed our journey. Elliot slept for a while, thank goodness. It was around 4 pm when Oli got a call from Miguel, her partner, to say her father had taken a turn for the worse.  A few minutes before we were talking about buying an ice cream at a petrol station but after this bad news I was in no mood for ice cream. A week ago last Sunday, Paco, his  father had been admitted to hospital with terminal stomach cancer. He had been diagnosed with metastasis in June and had rapidly deteriorated since then. Since he was admitted to hospital his digestive system stopped working and he was getting worse by the day.  How sad. I watched Elliot who was blissfully unaware of the news I have only met Paco on a few occasions and they were happy ones; at the birth of Elliot and on New Year's Eve at a party at our house in December 2018, just before the pandemic.  I had hoped he would live to see Juliet but it was not to be.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Just as we had the bad news, Oli's relatively new and state of the art mobile phone stopped working; the screen was broken. Thus she had to use mine to communicate with Miguel. Then Elliot had to use it to watch Peppa Pig to calm him down. Usually my phone is out of bounds for my not yet to be 2 year old grandson but on that stressful journey home, I had to let him have it. Thus communication was somewhat stressful too. I couldn't wait to get home. However even that would be difficult as we entered hot, hot Madrid at about 5ish. Oli didn't have her house keys so we drove first to our house to get the key. Eladio returned with her to help her unload and carry all her stuff with loads of baby paraphernalia to her flat. Thankfully I was allowed to stay at home. Mysteriously since then Elliot's bag of summer clothes and Oli's kindle never appeared and we suspect someone broke into the car during that stressful journey home. There is no other explanation. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">I walked into our bedroom and it was like a sauna. The temperature was 32ºc inside. I switched on the air con immediately and it was left on until the early hours of Monday morning. After unpacking, greeting my father and taking a shower, I went to look for my new guest, an Australian woman called Jenelle (Nellie) just 3 years younger than me  who has been "back packing" for a year and a half with her sister since the pandemic began in January 2019.  She and her sister had sold up their properties, put the proceeds into stocks and shares and  left for a 2 year trip around the world. They argued that now was the time to do it before they had grandchildren or were too old. Their first destinations were India and Nepal and they were in Kathmandu when the pandemic broke out. They had two choices, return to Australia or carry on their travels. They chose the latter and have been doing slow traveling ever since, staying long periods of time in Greece, Turkey, Egypt and now Spain. Their next destinations seem to be Italy and Cyprus. They have no fixed return date so are taking their trip slowly. Oh, how I envy them. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">We met by the pool and I immediately loved my new guest. I could tell she was the kind of guest who would turn out to be a friend. One of the great advantages of hosting people in our home is the opportunity to meet people from all over the world and to make new friends. I knew that Jenelle - aka as Nellie - would be one of them. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">We spoke for a while and then went to to the kitchen. My Aussie guest, true to her British origins, wanted a drink - i.e. something alcoholic. She offered me  vermouth, something I never drink so I got out a half full (notice I said half full and not half empty) bottle of chilled Bornos white wine from Rueda. Felipe, our Russian born lodger was having his dinner so we joined him on the kitchen patio. The encounter turned into a little drinks party; the sort I like best. There we were, an Australian, me and Felipe hybrids of Russian Spanish and Russian English origin and then my husband  who joined us, added another nationality; Spanish. It was like the United Nations. I should also count another nationality for Lucy who is from Paraguay. When the wine was finished I got out a bottle of Asturian cider and some gazpacho. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6RBEYaz8k_wviFbQUAvrbZl6HU7pxX66d_bpBI-pMmEMRcyrTCk7GL5RtqzPaqxjcIHSznTxPnisS3UpT8ofm_kntQ_VFjFCu1Oooq7EkGVEBSQBT86HxjL49sKJIffALtLsdIw/s1600/Sun+imprompu+party+with+my+international+guests.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="220" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6RBEYaz8k_wviFbQUAvrbZl6HU7pxX66d_bpBI-pMmEMRcyrTCk7GL5RtqzPaqxjcIHSznTxPnisS3UpT8ofm_kntQ_VFjFCu1Oooq7EkGVEBSQBT86HxjL49sKJIffALtLsdIw/w400-h220/Sun+imprompu+party+with+my+international+guests.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A scene from our impromptu international drinks evening with our guests on Sunday night</i></td></tr></tbody></table><i><div style="text-align: justify;">I also offered my guests some of my leftover apple crumble. We sat around the table exchanging information about our origins and our lives and it was the most wonderful end to a very stressful day.</div></i><p style="text-align: justify;">It was last Sunday when the Taliban entered the Afghan capital of Kabul. The fall of Kabul marked the end of a 20 year mission from western forces. In just one day freedom came to an end. The country's president, Ashraf Ghani fled the country, seeking refuge in Uzbekistan. Anyone who could get out was trying but there were no commercial flights leaving the country. Last Sunday and in the following days, the capital's airport, protected by US troops - those that were still there- was mobbed by thousands desperate to escape. Thousands are still trying to leave. There are many people who collaborated in the last 20 years with foreign forces, notably translators, and they know they will be a target for revenge. Many of them are trying still to get out. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJYEc2UnAcppGsXJbH3WbJ5XVbVcsaY7gNGIZKXI5d0beedXrSdzsWJGqopNQ5iP-aFlxSDgwWCCHrFlmdK9xe2yoB2-4fuEhJaDLjShmZasHPV5DCiJMQob4mjORPbscrHgnKSg/s2048/Airport+scene+Monday.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="269" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJYEc2UnAcppGsXJbH3WbJ5XVbVcsaY7gNGIZKXI5d0beedXrSdzsWJGqopNQ5iP-aFlxSDgwWCCHrFlmdK9xe2yoB2-4fuEhJaDLjShmZasHPV5DCiJMQob4mjORPbscrHgnKSg/w400-h269/Airport+scene+Monday.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Photo courtesy of The Times</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">But only military planes are leaving and taking home their nationals and some Afghans who had worked for their countries. Last Sunday marked too the beginning of the second era of Taliban rule and all that means, mostly for women. Women who had abandoned the old blue burqa were buying that awful curtain like overall again and there was  a roaring trade for them in markets everywhere. Imagine having to wear one of these?</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhgN8-uUVtIZpe1pLfBFQUVYbJ4-ftX-s2c3p3vGOleVQd7L4UDkl0Myrcmb5zXN7zys_JCixX2X7n915OPSZCBGCKMlBEwMt74anLvn_hlLV1vTsd5SLwVYwKjidquL7XHNRsxHQ/s806/burqas.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="270" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhgN8-uUVtIZpe1pLfBFQUVYbJ4-ftX-s2c3p3vGOleVQd7L4UDkl0Myrcmb5zXN7zys_JCixX2X7n915OPSZCBGCKMlBEwMt74anLvn_hlLV1vTsd5SLwVYwKjidquL7XHNRsxHQ/w400-h270/burqas.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Buying a burqa in Kabul</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine being a woman in Afghanistan today. Young women don't remember the previous Taliban rule but their mothers do and they are urging their daughters to wear these repressive burqas. The Taliban who never really disappeared, returned after Biden, the US President, ordered his troops home a few months ago. It has taken just this time for them to rule again. Oh how I hate the Taliban. Oh how I feel for women in this country, one of the most oppressive for women in the world. America was not looking good and it was on Monday that Joe Biden gave a press conference which offered a simple explanation. What I understood was that they left after training and funding a new Afghan army to fight the Taliban and that it was not the mission of the US to rebuild the country. Biden basically blamed the new army for not standing up to the Taliban. From what I have read and know, it is pretty obvious this would never work as allegiances are easily changed in Afghanistan and thus many soldiers either stopped fighting or joined the Taliban. This has happened over and over again so all of the US money to build a new army has come to nothing without them supervising. Then in an unprecedented move on Tuesday, the Taliban held a press conference for the world to watch and listen. The message was more moderate than in previous times but for me whatever they said that was moderate was for western ears only. Women, they say, will have rights but within their framework. We cannot believe a word they say because we know them for what they are. They will install a government based on the hardest version of Sharia law that exists, the hardest in the world. So yes they say girls can go to school but the reality is that probably they will only be taught religion. Not much more. Women will be confined to their houses, TV and music, not to mention internet, will be banned and no doubt hands will be chopped off of those suspected of stealing. There will be probably be a return to public executions. We are already seeing signs of it. What a mess. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">In our little drinks party on Sunday evening we briefly mentioned this news and thanked our lucky stars we live in the west which even with all its faults, is paradise compared to life under an oppressive regime. I went to bed at around 11 pm feeling exhausted after a very long and stressful day but thankfully I slept quite well.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I was awake at 6.30 on Monday morning.  I got a message soon after from Miguel who was on his way to the hospital. He asked us to take care of Oli and help her with Elliot as she is exhausted, mostly because she is heavily pregnant. We would do so of course. Oli needed either to mend her phone or buy a new one, so I suggested we go together and leave Elliot with his grandfather. The idea was to give Oli time off too which she badly needed. So there we were out shopping together at Spain's flagship department store, El Corte Inglés. I told her I felt like a criminal but it was also a thrilling feeling to be out shopping and on our own if only for 1.5 hours. Mending her phone was too costly to be worth it so my daughter decided to get a new one. I'm afraid I got one too. Mine is not old but the battery life is not what it was and I thought I deserved a new one after all my work this summer. We both got a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE with 250 GB which should have enough capacity even for me. It's not the latest model which is the S21 but I preferred the S20 because it has room for a memory card and you don't have to rely on Samsung's Cloud storage. This model is 5G so is quite up to date. There were none in stock but hopefully we should get our new phones quite soon. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiSnJHh9tWPo6_zAwRsE8Sqv8T_YorSzu5zAFzSnq7cVFnKjoFfEXBC6Tr5oKR5S8fRGGzKnu4DWoKFTbxIyLWoOAjUmtMWvowy1gG78VgjAqUZzl7L3-esJmooJFHakaJVl4fo7w/s800/4122-samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-5g-8-256gb-violeta-libre-especificaciones.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiSnJHh9tWPo6_zAwRsE8Sqv8T_YorSzu5zAFzSnq7cVFnKjoFfEXBC6Tr5oKR5S8fRGGzKnu4DWoKFTbxIyLWoOAjUmtMWvowy1gG78VgjAqUZzl7L3-esJmooJFHakaJVl4fo7w/w400-h400/4122-samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-5g-8-256gb-violeta-libre-especificaciones.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Soon to be my new phone</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">While at the department store I splashed out on a new bottle of perfume as I was completely running out.

We both put on our bathing costumes and took him down to the pool where we spent the afternoon.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiBpqB-wxyJDNf1dQRtvSY7eufItuG3K5yFvxYFQY8kb0z3LmChNSictoHzIOoHoIkBnvMN3_6y9QZQNQh9tiAQg4hpXamlz4ShaI_0ME4jdJZZC2QcF4ExF1isd41H55yzBEU9Ew/s2543/Monday+O+and+E+and+Pippa+pool.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiBpqB-wxyJDNf1dQRtvSY7eufItuG3K5yFvxYFQY8kb0z3LmChNSictoHzIOoHoIkBnvMN3_6y9QZQNQh9tiAQg4hpXamlz4ShaI_0ME4jdJZZC2QcF4ExF1isd41H55yzBEU9Ew/w195-h400/Monday+O+and+E+and+Pippa+pool.jpg" width="195"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Oli and Elliot in the water on Monday afternoon with Pippa looking on</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Little Elliot was completely oblivious to the fate of his other grandfather as he enjoyed life with us. Oli was permanently on the alert for news and so were we. We finally got the fatal news when Miguel called my youngest daughter shortly before 6 pm. Even though we were expecting the bad news, it still shocked us all. The only thing that comforted me was the fact that both his sons and his wife were with him until the end. I reflected that when my mother and my brother died I was not able to be with them. I would have loved that privilege however awful the moment would have been. We wanted to join Miguel and his family but he told us it would all take a long time and not to go until the next day when the coffin would be placed at the big funeral parlour on the M40 ring road in Madrid. In Spain it is customary to take the deceased person to lie in a funeral parlour so family and friends can pay their respects. Then 24 hours after death the body is either cremated or buried. We would go to the funeral parlour the next day. My heart went out to the family and I was upset that Paco would never meet Juliet soon to be born. He did however get to know his little grandson Elliot and that brings me comfort. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">I'm sure Oli would have liked to be with Miguel in those dreadful moments but we advised her not to go. She is  too pregnant to be driving far from home. Thus she stayed and we had dinner together. Lucy made us some Spanish tortilla some of which I saved for Nellie, my Australian guest. When they left I spent some time with my new Airbnb friend by the pool. It helped me relax after such bad news.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Tuesday came and it was to be a somber day. Oli picked us up at about 10.30 and we went in search of flowers before getting to the funeral parlour. We only found closed florists with owners and staff on holiday. In August Spain almost grinds to a halt. Thus I had to get them online and that worked fast. I was very ashamed later to see that ours were the most humble of all the flowers people sent. We arrived soon at the big funeral parlour which I have seen countless times when I have driven on the M40 but never imagined myself going inside. But I did on Tuesday. I wore black out of respect but also because I don't really have a smart summer dress suitable for a funeral. I did, at least, get Eladio to wear long trousers and a long sleeved shirt. It was so good to finally be able to hug the family. Maybe we shouldn't have because of Covid but we are all vaccinated and we needed to hug. Elliot, of course, hadn't a clue what was going on. As the parlour assigned to his other grandfather was on one of the upper floors he was delighted to see all the cars on the ring road, shouting out "car, car, .car". He was also delighted without knowing why to suddenly be together with his two grandmothers. He had never experienced that since he was a baby and of course he can't remember. He kept holding both our hands and he just brought a breath of joy to an otherwise very sad occasion. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We stayed for about 2 hours comforting the family who was distraught just as I was when I lost my mother and then my own brother. There is no preparing for the death of a parent or child. We came home for lunch which dear Lucy made and in the early evening returned for a little service called a "responso" before Paco was taken to a cemetery on the other side of Madrid to be cremated.  I hoped his family would be able to rest too. They will be going through the mourning or grief period, one I am very familiar with. Time helps and heals but it's early days and now they are distraught. I hoped they would at least be able to sleep.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Once home, we were all exhausted, especially my heavily pregnant daughter Oli. I made a huge effort to come up with something for dinner as our cupboards were practically bare. When Oli and Elliot left I sat with my guests Felipe and Nellie. We spoke about the Taliban press conference. Neither of us women were on the same page as our Russian born guest who argued that it was sort of ok for women to be second class citizens in Afghanistan as that was the country's culture. Obviously we heartily disagreed.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There was no rest for the wicked that night as I got into bed tired after a long, hot and sad day, because I started getting messages from potential swimming pool guests for this weekend. I finally got a reservation for 12 who are coming today while we are away. That had me messaging to and fro until well past midnight.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Wednesday came and my priority was shopping. Eladio's was to mow the lawn. Good for him; it needed doing. He was up early to beat the sun and still hadn't finished when I left to do the shopping. I took Nellie with me as she hadn't left the house since her arrival and her cupboards were bare too. It was lovely to go out with my new friend. For her, food shopping here is rather different to in Australia of course. We went to Mercadona then to the more exclusive BM after which I took her for a coffee to Alverán, our local little cafe I am fond of. We sat there for a long time chatting away - we are both chatterboxes. Thankfully by Wednesday the weather had cooled down to 34ºc max (that's still a lot) and life was pleasanter outside. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We came home to unpack the shopping and that's when I spied fruit on a fig tree just under the garage roof. I looked up and could see a few. How exciting. Our fig trees are quite young and until this year had not borne any fruit. Although I have lived in Spain since 1980, I still get a thrill from fruit growing in our Mediterranean garden or when I spy orange trees lining the streets of some of Spain's towns and cities. I still find it exotic as I was born in England where picking figs or peaches from your garden is almost unheard of. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj_6ckf6aG7WwXSL_8RBDeNoFCog2ZX0Er3-VKt735tb4KX4oMqxz2KFhnVWvEX8T9tiKC8H7v40vpnq__6iKHp-2J_7j0vaZdtRb7fdfh1wnXoQ2Jxb55zVkDMbYWAoWxARjHRFQUQ93DjIj_4A59SakJymoeLHYLtI4MBDrzse7dU5hTdukU=s2543" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj_6ckf6aG7WwXSL_8RBDeNoFCog2ZX0Er3-VKt735tb4KX4oMqxz2KFhnVWvEX8T9tiKC8H7v40vpnq__6iKHp-2J_7j0vaZdtRb7fdfh1wnXoQ2Jxb55zVkDMbYWAoWxARjHRFQUQ93DjIj_4A59SakJymoeLHYLtI4MBDrzse7dU5hTdukU=w195-h400" width="195"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio on the ladder picking figs</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Eladio only picked 4 as the rest weren't ripe enough.

I chose to lie on the new sunbed in the shade by the pool with my kindle. I would spend the rest of the afternoon there too, all by myself and in peace with no household or family responsibilities; what luxury. There was time too for a skype call with Amanda, my oldest school friend who lives in Devon. It was good to catch up as we had missed two weekly calls. There she was inside her home with a thick jumper on and there I was sitting by the pool clad in light summer clothes. After catching up with my friend I had half an hour more to myself. I chose to ring Oli who I was missing as I was missing Elliot. It was my first day without them for more than 10 days. Oli was resting at home, rest she needed. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Dinner time came, the highlight of my day in the summer.

She has been a pleasure to host. I wish her well on her travels and hope to see her again. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">That night we watched a documentary film about the Spanish poet and play writer, Federico García Lorca. It was on because Wednesday 18th August was the 85th anniversary of his death at the hands of a nationalistic firing squad at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. Lorca is one of Spain's most famous poets and I studied his life and work when I did my degree in Hispanic Studies at Nottingham University. Lorca is loved in Spain by many but he is revered so much more by English and American Hispanists. I'm not sure why he is so revered by them. I think it has something to do with the fact that first he was gay - so taboo in Spain at the time and also because of his works on the repression of women. That's what made me fall in love with his work. Of all the Spanish writers I studied he is still my favourite. So, I watched the documentary film avidly on Wednesday night.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Thursday 19th August dawned, a day I had been looking forward to for a long time. We were leaving for our 5 day holiday and anniversary trip to  La Rioja  - the famous wine growing area in Spain - to celebrate our 38th wedding anniversary which was yesterday, 21st August. Gosh, 38 years, that's a long time. We always celebrate our anniversary and in the past few years have gone on holiday to do so. The idea is to celebrate it every year as we really cannot know how many years we have left of good health. Inspired perhaps by Nellie, it was in La Rioja here that an idea formed in my head for next year's trip. The idea is to go on a long and slow road trip all the way to Iran. I have long wanted to visit Iran after receiving Iranian guests from Airbnb. They assured me the country was very safe but that may not be so for UK independent travelers or so I was told by someone in the know. If that is so we shall take his advice and head to Georgia and or Armenia instead Eladio loved the idea so watch this space. This is something very special to look forward to; the trip of our lifetime. So, thanks Nellie, for the inspiration. Maybe we will meet in Georgia.

By about 10.30 on Thursday morning we were in the car and off. I had booked a table at one of my favourite places in Spain, the Hotel Landa Palace just outside Burgos, the lovely cathedral town you may have heard of. It was a good job I had as there were huge queues for the cafeteria and all the tables at the restaurant were booked. We sat down at a little table for two in the magnificent Castillian style dining room and we knew exactly what we would order; suckling lamb.

I was in awe of what I saw. Rioja wine is superb and there I was seeing the grapes ripening and soon to be picked and turned into the wonderful wine from this area. I learned on this trip that wine as we know it today was first made on a big scale in this area when an epidemic called "phylloxera"   ruined the crops in the Bordeaux region which has a similar climate to La Rioja. This happened in the late 19th century. Thus the French wine makers came over to Spain and started making their wine here. They showed the locals how to make it their way and thus wine making in La Rioja as we know it today took off. The rest is history. Although there are many wine making regions in Spain, Rioja is the most internationally recognised of all Spanish wines. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgL6jNBLb37qikp1UPB4n56WRAZW0Vmu0D6hXSHvTYBX74dYFjt61pWzBYIIeTdbcT0pIum1Lnl-loD2ZrC1lg6sOs6JqjTAyDXtFC5tWR4P6YFLw_Yks263sGZsejdbL-FSn9QRNXFxUe83RA6ubv2w4DNbbD9XsoqNTI7Eql1hPxVZ_CwmIk=s2543" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgL6jNBLb37qikp1UPB4n56WRAZW0Vmu0D6hXSHvTYBX74dYFjt61pWzBYIIeTdbcT0pIum1Lnl-loD2ZrC1lg6sOs6JqjTAyDXtFC5tWR4P6YFLw_Yks263sGZsejdbL-FSn9QRNXFxUe83RA6ubv2w4DNbbD9XsoqNTI7Eql1hPxVZ_CwmIk=w400-h195" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg8VlraVYpjDgJLB75xH9FtWq0eUiZ_myyHgiP0xsQLb9vPqd4Jk7EwEQE08BM132OJKC5aQJBwO5kHeFJt6jbKL6a8u31VLv227gVjNDs6If_xQ5SSYmdyvdfljk0YkIEhEVzJ2RbyvR8lrUyJR8qExqunVoLuYi31FN3DinvxQtah8OG3cDU=s2543" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg8VlraVYpjDgJLB75xH9FtWq0eUiZ_myyHgiP0xsQLb9vPqd4Jk7EwEQE08BM132OJKC5aQJBwO5kHeFJt6jbKL6a8u31VLv227gVjNDs6If_xQ5SSYmdyvdfljk0YkIEhEVzJ2RbyvR8lrUyJR8qExqunVoLuYi31FN3DinvxQtah8OG3cDU=w400-h195" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Vineyards and grapes to be seen everywhere in the Rioja region</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I was interrupted by more reservation enquiries and had to attend to them - there is no rest for the wicked.

We were going to a bodega. We could have gone to any of the big ones but decided on a small one. Called<a href="https://www.senoriodelibano.com/"> Señorío de Líbano</a> and located in the pretty little village of Sajazarra (try saying that), it had been recommended by the host of the Airbnb house we are going to today on the second part of our trip. She, in turn, had been inspired by a tweet from one of Spain's most famous journalists - Jordi Evole. He had been on holiday in Sajazarra and visited the bodega. I rang and got a slot for a visit starting at 11 am on Friday morning. As we drove the 20km or so past rows and rows of grape vines we spied what we thought were people picking the grapes - immigrants of course. I had to have a photo. I got it although the workers protested. I later heard they weren't picking the grapes but pruning the bushes.

She was just great and just what I needed. Lola found my back, shoulder and neck very very stiff. I knew that of course. Lola surmised that judging by the state of the muscles on my back that I was a very active and responsible type of person and a bit nervous too.  She may be right. I felt great after the massage and wandered down to the garden in my bath robe  - I felt completely at home at this little hotel. It was still too warm for an evening walk and Eladio and I read in the garden until about 8 pm. We then left the hotel to explore our village - Briñas.

Ours has been and is a good marriage. To quote my friend Anne it is "as good as it gets" and I have no regrets. I love my partner to the moon and back and without him I think my life would never have been so stable or happy. Thank you Eladio. The years have passed indeed - 38 of them. This was us, two young things on our wedding day on 21st August 1983. I have to say I am glad Eladio never went  bald or developed a beer belly (hahahaha). </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh83UHNgSxk4dKXGc7XKv0eXTrYPCZ5hiswqhYDIBAOgKUvwxI9CA3cQqyAFJNWHuSVoSQnyfDvPwvtlNyllztnTro0YsDLasV1C520SMeHlocZfj1V7zeiHb2DYeGQ7TKgP7prM8lb1D2IbKMGKHPefmaeNJ3lgq4HJPFRZZ1izUNLrA5hvTs=s1627" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh83UHNgSxk4dKXGc7XKv0eXTrYPCZ5hiswqhYDIBAOgKUvwxI9CA3cQqyAFJNWHuSVoSQnyfDvPwvtlNyllztnTro0YsDLasV1C520SMeHlocZfj1V7zeiHb2DYeGQ7TKgP7prM8lb1D2IbKMGKHPefmaeNJ3lgq4HJPFRZZ1izUNLrA5hvTs=w265-h400" width="265"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>On our wedding day 38 years ago</i></td></tr></tbody></table><i><br></br></i><div style="text-align: justify;">We would celebrate in the evening but felt happy and like young lovers all day. We decided to explore some of the pretty little villages we hadn't seen before and which had been recommended to us. We started with Briones which is a bit bigger than Briñas the village where we have been staying. It's not far and we loved it as soon as we saw it. The village is perched high up over the River Ebro with great views from the old walls which once must have surrounded it in the times of the wars between neighbouring Navarra and Castille before the country was united. That's why there are so many castles in Spain. Ah and because of the "Reconquista", the reconquering of Spain from the Moors who were finally expelled in 1492 (the year Colombus sailed the ocean blue - remember that from school?). So La Rioja may be all about wine but there is a lot of history too. We had our photo taken by the walls with amazing views of the river and vineyards which is one of the few photos of the two of us on this trip. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEizpLwfEdhPm7u1sYJrqt0g4e8FSANhswWW09SplYUCXvIBm_xjlUzYclvrxW8QQacP3w1Hx-pkYfsZME0idAWeAhQxfIE5kx0CdHkjgi1bXrwAf1wxV7oM5Foenv8-dfbua-4jYz5X0N_kqR36lVzTBW8k25z1_5JtHORn14tWiSWGFOFaWBA=s2543" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEizpLwfEdhPm7u1sYJrqt0g4e8FSANhswWW09SplYUCXvIBm_xjlUzYclvrxW8QQacP3w1Hx-pkYfsZME0idAWeAhQxfIE5kx0CdHkjgi1bXrwAf1wxV7oM5Foenv8-dfbua-4jYz5X0N_kqR36lVzTBW8k25z1_5JtHORn14tWiSWGFOFaWBA=w400-h195" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Yesterday, the day of our 38th anniversary - 21st August -  saw us in Briones, another pretty little village in La Rioja. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;">We also saw a bit of the old city where as in nearly all towns and cities in Spain there is a main square always called "plaza mayor". </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgbmJ90M_nafUpD0zuPAW_8Z4BH0-_VINIgKAKNgjoXcynb38Tc78TL8SFwQ_oXbNvpuQGwqE4gEvsUUmryCgJu6jfiQ_8YSHAEjGjkh2JjvnlyQodeTKsgSZ583yd5C2L2qYarFKondmgMjAivQ8tZYpKo-Eq8f7fkCkVRtZpW9ZPpe8co-YA=s2543" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgbmJ90M_nafUpD0zuPAW_8Z4BH0-_VINIgKAKNgjoXcynb38Tc78TL8SFwQ_oXbNvpuQGwqE4gEvsUUmryCgJu6jfiQ_8YSHAEjGjkh2JjvnlyQodeTKsgSZ583yd5C2L2qYarFKondmgMjAivQ8tZYpKo-Eq8f7fkCkVRtZpW9ZPpe8co-YA=w400-h195" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Plaza Mayor in Briones.

Casa Encantada means enchanted house and we only realised why when we had seen it all because we were enchanted with the visit. The house is a museum full of domestic items from the 19th and 20th century with exhibits of how houses used to be in the area. We loved it. Eladio having been brought up on a farm in the second half of the 20th century recognised many of the items. <div><br></br></div><div>From Briones we drove to San Vicente de la Sonsierra, another town with lots of wineries. We had already seen one and bought enough wine so were more keen on seeing another pretty little village and we were not disappointed. We especially loved the "Plaza Mayor" with its wine motif spring with fountains of water in the shape of swans. Everyone was drinking from them and taking photos. I did too. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiyf9YBjeZEarNjaf0VMj76NgPCjxDFSMAXcbJDxBkhg5f3ECP4SHL9PxiQmsPgrRhdn2JgO4J4YMBisI02oBQYnmvPtH4JHRGGcShKJP6zoFeIcNIVF_YAt_l3F58g1Q_k2WDVfIJjKZVGXtxGz407tggx7IaJfSKT_7roXw4MzeToregKulQ=s2543" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiyf9YBjeZEarNjaf0VMj76NgPCjxDFSMAXcbJDxBkhg5f3ECP4SHL9PxiQmsPgrRhdn2JgO4J4YMBisI02oBQYnmvPtH4JHRGGcShKJP6zoFeIcNIVF_YAt_l3F58g1Q_k2WDVfIJjKZVGXtxGz407tggx7IaJfSKT_7roXw4MzeToregKulQ=w400-h195" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>In the main square of San Vicente, having a coffee</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We had read that the main attraction of San Vicente was the castle and the views over the River Ebro - supposed to be one of the best in La Rioja. We got as far as the steps of the castle and as it was so hot we stayed below but still enjoyed the views which were as good as promised. We could see Briones from there where apparently  a peace treaty had been signed between the Kingdoms of  Navarra and Castille. It was signed in 1379 between Enrique II, King of Castille and Carlos II of Navarra. At the time San Vicente belonged to Navarra and Briones to Castille. Only the river separated the two kingdoms. It's hard to imagine that now. <table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjxQcw3h-axB97eM_tiEzxTvtaBtsUBSjeQVgMaSUXjRM1L1SU2m3eHAy_2nxBWyqSsdzF92s6bc6vr9ImloM8-gnGM0FKwDixeZOOqERvvxKp-NA1702MF2IySEDJ0FMINb04MCqLkZ53Q995CXcWxyFEi-aUgv2IKgrD_BCxc0H3zY4hhBtk=s2543" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjxQcw3h-axB97eM_tiEzxTvtaBtsUBSjeQVgMaSUXjRM1L1SU2m3eHAy_2nxBWyqSsdzF92s6bc6vr9ImloM8-gnGM0FKwDixeZOOqERvvxKp-NA1702MF2IySEDJ0FMINb04MCqLkZ53Q995CXcWxyFEi-aUgv2IKgrD_BCxc0H3zY4hhBtk=w400-h195" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The view from the castle of San Vicente de Sonsierra of the River Ebro and the medieval bridge that separates it from Briones.</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>We only had time to visit one more village on our bucket list and decided it would be Cuzcurrita de Río Tirón, another medieval village but by a different river this time.

So when we were hungry we went in search of the nearest bar to have tapas. Tapas in this area and in the Basque Country are more usually called "pinchos" (pintxos in the Basque Country). What they are is a sort of tapa on bread with a tooth pick like stick holding the topping to the bread. All the toppings are delicious. I went for prawns and croquettes and Eladio went for cod. Being in La Rioja we both had a glass of local red wine which tasted delicious. <div><br></br></div><div>Sticking to our usual routine, we drove "home" - to the hotel to have a siesta and seek refuge from the heat. The air con was much appreciated and our bed very comfortable. I couldn't sleep though and after a while when I had rested, came down to the lovely little garden of which I have become very fond. Eladio later joined me and there we sat at one of the tables each of us with our laptop. I wondered if on our wedding day we had envisaged what our lives would be like together. We were only starting out then but very soon formed a family. The rest is not yet history. It is a life together well led with its ups and downs but built upon a rock of love.  </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgMQX2GlQnA29NmE9V98SfoDGQPWuvkcPFSIz3cNl6fZYJrXI8NjXY6jCO9-aCJlm7S6egf4dI0czFrRMb3gbwUG3uIhD7UCwvm_0WUgIW1eMn34ET1HGbbWVApZd8qSLz9QQt42EznJKmkdWiKX7uJqWqi0EyoDanJqhTImNC_DKPUugtWouk=s2543" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgMQX2GlQnA29NmE9V98SfoDGQPWuvkcPFSIz3cNl6fZYJrXI8NjXY6jCO9-aCJlm7S6egf4dI0czFrRMb3gbwUG3uIhD7UCwvm_0WUgIW1eMn34ET1HGbbWVApZd8qSLz9QQt42EznJKmkdWiKX7uJqWqi0EyoDanJqhTImNC_DKPUugtWouk=w400-h195" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio in the hotel garden yesterday afternoon.</i></td></tr></tbody></table><i><br></br></i><div>Soon it was time to dress up for dinner.
