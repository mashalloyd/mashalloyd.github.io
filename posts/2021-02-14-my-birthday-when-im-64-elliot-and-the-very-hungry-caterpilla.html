Wouldn't it be lovely to be able to go out to dinner today? But we can't because of Covid restrictions. When will they end? No time soon. The numbers of those infected and the death toll have again risen but in Europe we are finally seeing this third wave, perhaps the worst of all, coming to a plateau. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Last Sunday the global number of infected was 106.377.451 and today it stands at 109.131.595. Last Sunday the global death toll was 2.321.363 and today it stands at 2.406.116. It looks like the incerase in weekly numbers is gradually decreasing. Oh, I hope so. From what I have heard and read, finally the number of those being vaccinated is higher than those getting infected. But the vaccine is not being rolled out fast enough, here in Spain and other EU countries. But where the situation is dire is in Africa and the underdeveloped countries. We need to vaccinate the whole world as the virus knows no borders and if we don't it will come back again. We are all in this together but countries are acting selfishly, only worrying about their own populations. I wish I could tell you this week that my father, soon to be 102, has been vaccinated but we have heard nothing. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Last Sunday was another quiet day in semi lockdown which I often refer to as house arrest - there is not much difference. Well, we could go on our walk and were able to drive to a local supermarket to get some fresh fish to make fish and chips for my birthday. We nearly always have fish and chips (with mushy peas) on birthdays in this house. We also have cake and usually we get a fruit one covered in white chocolate from our favourite cake shop, Alverán. We went there to pick up the cake Eladio had ordered. I then succumbed to temptation and went to another bakery called Manacor to buy some raspberry and strawberry mini tarts filled with whipped cream. I can't resist them whenever I see them. I thought they would be nice for lunch that day as a pre-birthday celebration. My father, who also loves them, couldn't have agreed more. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiCPzdwCXsFSBkKWRpxr8XLvmfXqgiYyKSaZKFHVvaA0YPAGVwB1kF4H0Q-boU_aKNdC-8soHkPwbmjqbWs1ERLC34f5ti-vLlWxktR4TyZ_7UFSm4aISnInh67y2vcoYpzkfCHUA/s1872/20210208_082119.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="295" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiCPzdwCXsFSBkKWRpxr8XLvmfXqgiYyKSaZKFHVvaA0YPAGVwB1kF4H0Q-boU_aKNdC-8soHkPwbmjqbWs1ERLC34f5ti-vLlWxktR4TyZ_7UFSm4aISnInh67y2vcoYpzkfCHUA/w400-h295/20210208_082119.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Pre-birthday celebrations on Sunday with this delicious fruit tart. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">Sunday was quiet but I had Monday to look forward to as it was my birthday on 8th February. I would be turning 64. How could that be? At lunch with my father I reminded him it was to be my birthday but he knew it was the next day. He was looking forward to the family breakfast and family lunch. So was I.  I did miss though going out for dinner as we always do on our birthdays but that's not on the cards in these Covid days of course. Where have the years gone I wondered? I remember my own father turning 64 as that was the year he retired; 1983. That was also the year we married, nearly 38 years ago. I shall never forget the moment walking down the aisle with him at my side in his newly bought suit which was a bit too big for him. I was so proud of my father and like to think he was proud of me too.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjpw2Bttsypk6d2IBgugErhuwKH6fSrxCta0D8qLHfDgdgXz8A4YXZ6Gysqv6AHkdwdGF4juyxQ7KXeuScropTX-sAdbFHhcZV26T8I718HSH9qosTfRyPpHL8wcLNN27pXGqk0w/s1695/Courtenay%2527s+daughter+Masha%2527s+wedding+Madrid+Aug+1983.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjpw2Bttsypk6d2IBgugErhuwKH6fSrxCta0D8qLHfDgdgXz8A4YXZ6Gysqv6AHkdwdGF4juyxQ7KXeuScropTX-sAdbFHhcZV26T8I718HSH9qosTfRyPpHL8wcLNN27pXGqk0w/w299-h400/Courtenay%2527s+daughter+Masha%2527s+wedding+Madrid+Aug+1983.jpg" width="299"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Walking down the aisle on my wedding day with my father. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">I shall remember that moment forever. It was a very special father and daughter moment.  To think he was my age that year, 64, the age I reached this week, sobers me. Where did the years go? My mother and brother both passed away since our wedding as well as my Aunty Masha. Oh how I miss them. On the whole though these last 38 years have been good to us. We have been blessed with our lovely daughters and now little Elliot, my grandson and the apple of my eye. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">I was up early on my birthday which this year fell on the worst day possible; a Monday. It was raining too so the Carpenters' song. "Rainy days and Mondays always get me down" was applicable. However, I was determined to enjoy my birthday as much as I could. Another song in my mind was the famous Beatles' song "When I'm 64". I must have heard it many many times as a young girl but never imagined myself actually getting to 64. I looked up the lyrics which are: </p><div class="ujudUb" style="background-color: white; color: #202124; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.58; margin-bottom: 12px;"><div style="text-align: justify;">When I get older losing my hair</div><span><div style="text-align: justify;">Many years from now</div></span><span><div style="text-align: justify;">Will you still be sending me a Valentine</div></span><span><div style="text-align: justify;">Birthday greetings bottle of wine</div></span></div><div class="ujudUb" style="background-color: white; color: #202124; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.58; margin-bottom: 12px;"><div style="text-align: justify;">If I'd been out till quarter to three</div><span><div style="text-align: justify;">Would you lock the door</div></span><span><div style="text-align: justify;">Will you still need me, will you still feed me</div></span><span><div style="text-align: justify;">When I'm sixty-four</div></span></div><div class="ujudUb" style="background-color: white; color: #202124; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.58; margin-bottom: 12px;"><div style="text-align: justify;">You'll be older too</div><span><div style="text-align: justify;">And if you say the word</div></span><span><div style="text-align: justify;">I could stay with you</div></span></div><div class="ujudUb" style="background-color: white; color: #202124; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.58; margin-bottom: 12px;"><div style="text-align: justify;">I could be handy, mending a fuse</div><span><div style="text-align: justify;">When your lights have gone</div></span><span><div style="text-align: justify;">You can knit a sweater by the fireside</div></span><span><div style="text-align: justify;">Sunday mornings go for a ride</div></span><span><div style="text-align: justify;">Doing the garden, digging the weeds</div></span><span><div style="text-align: justify;">Who could ask for more</div></span></div><div class="ujudUb" style="background-color: white; color: #202124; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.58; margin-bottom: 12px;"><div style="text-align: justify;">Will you still need me, will you still feed me</div><span><div style="text-align: justify;">When I'm sixty-four</div></span></div><div class="ujudUb WRZytc OULBYb" style="background-color: white; color: #202124; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.58; margin-bottom: 0px;"><div style="text-align: justify;">Every summer we can rent a cottage</div><span><div style="text-align: justify;">In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear</div></span><span><div style="text-align: justify;"><span>We shall scrimp and save</span>…</div></span></div><p style="text-align: justify;">It's actually quite applicable and in many ways describes my life today with my dear husband by my side, still looking after me as I look after him.

It was my favourite perfume, Oh Lola by Marc Jacobs which has now been discontinued so it was hard to find.</div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">After breakfast we needed a walk to work off some of the excess breakfast and hopefully have some room in our "tummies" for our birthday lunch of home made fish and chips.  Suzy rang me just as we were setting off. It must have been 3 in the morning for her in Costa Rica but she gets up at that time to give her English lessons to Chinese children owing to the time difference in China. It was lovely to see her. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I came home to find a bouquet of flowers had been delivered. Eladio was quick to say they weren't from him. He has had so many hints over the years that I would love flowers from him but he never gets it.

I can see the progress in him every day. He loves his toys we keep for him here, especially the old boot and dolls' houses which had belonged to his mother and Aunty Suzy who he calls Aunty Bonny, Bonny being her family nickname. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">But what he likes best is a book bought for him by my dear friends, Kathy and Phil, when he was born; The Very Hungry Caterpillar, by Eric Carle and first published in 1969. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8TQVu8JDQPE3lTvnvJBwVrKSY6h2zJ9LqTrb-bSKz5XFAcm6xChd_9iCHL9ighr8doEqzOF6-ozPPP2gbXKuH5-lcn2nAizhj_u5j83sh4727MJSSW6vfBM5h6kJN0oLfuX5eLg/s728/the-very-hungry-caterpillar-1-728.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh8TQVu8JDQPE3lTvnvJBwVrKSY6h2zJ9LqTrb-bSKz5XFAcm6xChd_9iCHL9ighr8doEqzOF6-ozPPP2gbXKuH5-lcn2nAizhj_u5j83sh4727MJSSW6vfBM5h6kJN0oLfuX5eLg/w400-h300/the-very-hungry-caterpillar-1-728.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Elliot's overall favourite book</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">I have read it to him over and over again and he never tires of it. He knows all the creatures and food in the book and glees with joy when the caterpillar turns into a butterfly. He then hands me the dog teared book to me to read over again and I can't resist. He has many books and I wonder why it this one that is his favourite. He loves animals so maybe that's it. Ah, and he loves food so maybe that's another reason. His parents told us that recently the teachers at the nursery told them he eats a lot and waits for everyone to finish in case there is something left on their plates for him to gobble up. Like The Very Hungry Caterpillar, he eats anything and everything. There is nothing he rejects. Funny little boy. No wonder he is so growing so fast. He  Oli caught me on camera reading it to him on my birthday and I have chosen it as this week's feature photo. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Soon it was time for lunch. Lucy made the chips and I made the fish in beer batter and mushy peas. Everyone agrees in this house that this is our favourite meal. One of the many things I miss about my home country is fish and chips. Curry too, by the way. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSxmw5RRLQE00o_HmXDlSoxJcohgduoHVkVj8m9pt4EOBz76znu3zDjzkwXcwCdwS5Nqm9oLnNje54MRqOHSzBp5GVKw4vAoIaMh0zapMFd21C370dR-oddefExvtbfgA5hp77IQ/s2543/fish+and+chips.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhSxmw5RRLQE00o_HmXDlSoxJcohgduoHVkVj8m9pt4EOBz76znu3zDjzkwXcwCdwS5Nqm9oLnNje54MRqOHSzBp5GVKw4vAoIaMh0zapMFd21C370dR-oddefExvtbfgA5hp77IQ/w400-h195/fish+and+chips.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Fish and chips for lunch on my birthday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">Soon it was the cake moment and I enjoyed it with Elliot on my lap.

We played again later and then it was time for them to go. </div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The rest of the day was quiet and pleasant. I felt cheered up by my birthday and especially because Elliot had been with me to celebrate it. Oh how I love that little boy. My heart warms just thinking about him. The best thing about my birthday was it being a break in the pandemic, a break thinking about it and having something to celebrate. Even without my birthday I had lots to celebrate as I commented to Eladio that night when we went to bed. I did not have cancer, I have a job, none of us has been affected by Covid and all of us are well. So, no complaining from me that day. It actually gave me a lift. What also gave me a lift were all the birthday wishes from family, friends and acquaintances on all sorts of media: whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, email and also phone calls. I was specially happy to receive a call from an ex Motorola colleague, Joâo M.D who was the country manager of the office in Portugal. Many an adventure we had together but I haven't seen him since I left in 1999. "Obrigada" Joâo for your lovely call and everyone else's calls and messages. There are too many of you to mention but you all touched my heart when you took time to reach out to me on my birthday this week. Thank you all. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Tuesday came and I felt lifted after a lovely birthday, despite the circumstances. My spirits were also lifted because that morning I had something different to do. I had a small job at the UNED University, thanks to my dear friend Julio who works there. It was to do the voice over for a video about the digital economy in the European Union (nothing exciting hahaha). It felt so lovely to be going out for something productive and I dressed up for the occasion. I even put on make-up for the first time in ages, probably since Christmas Eve. I had to have a photo before I left and there was only me to take it so I stood in front of my mirror haha, mobile in my hand. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgu9W-iW3YP67PoIR624gmN664rHdtVZSZGO_PJ0gMl6eGFnTdbQNVaQfuaC51-1oTFMK9JPiYIsaIgO0GDO2N-9X0bLwDamtU6ddCAqRUVIftmC8y6i39OZ-LdBXqAWNacv5TpZg/s2743/ready+to+go.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgu9W-iW3YP67PoIR624gmN664rHdtVZSZGO_PJ0gMl6eGFnTdbQNVaQfuaC51-1oTFMK9JPiYIsaIgO0GDO2N-9X0bLwDamtU6ddCAqRUVIftmC8y6i39OZ-LdBXqAWNacv5TpZg/w168-h400/ready+to+go.jpg" width="168"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Ready to go out on Tuesday morning</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was  a freezing cold day with strong winds. Julio was waiting for me when I finally found the building in the Ciudad Universitaria (University City). Of course we couldn't hug or kiss so had to make do with a smile. So sad. We soon met the audiovisual coordinator and he took us to the recording studios. I was a bit thrown when I was told I had to read with my mask on but there was no other option. Here I am ready to go.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjpBSTqDEytvER-BeMnBqU0K3gKuIlaex3VHxws1nEOly1SbIQk4DRWzCv8zpBw355_vfuw330dJwppj8cNVEEGg788A4IslCeqfXVOtg3Qx252oBcb2w6rc4zMYClJP6DH9kv7_w/s2048/in+the+radio+studio.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="241" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjpBSTqDEytvER-BeMnBqU0K3gKuIlaex3VHxws1nEOly1SbIQk4DRWzCv8zpBw355_vfuw330dJwppj8cNVEEGg788A4IslCeqfXVOtg3Qx252oBcb2w6rc4zMYClJP6DH9kv7_w/w400-h241/in+the+radio+studio.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>With my mask on about to start the voice over job</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I had practiced quite a lot so was nearly word perfect and hardly had to repeat anything. Thus the job was soon over and Julio and I were free to go. We found a café in the nearby IT faculty but we had our coffee outside for fear of Covid aerosols. It wasn't an ideal place to have a coffee together and we were soon walking back to our cars. I ran the last few yards as it began to pour with rain. It was great to see my friend Julio and we promised to meet again soon for a coffee in better weather.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was too wet for our walk that day so I spent the remaining part of the morning making our lunch - asparagus and mushroom soup followed by meatballs. During our siesta I didn't sleep as I was keen to watch the second half of a delightful film called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_Season_(film)">Bee Season</a>". It's about a family (Jewish) where academia is the norm and the youngest daughter hopes to attract her fanatical father's attention (Richard Gere) by competing in spelling competitions (spelling bees). I loved it. It explores family relations and  religion apart from the story of a child genius. The girl who plays Eliza (Flora Cross) who is so good at spelling, does an amazing job. I then decided to give Bridgerton a try, that fantasy regency so called period drama, mostly set in Bath. I watched one episode and some of it is tolerable but it is rather ridiculous as I expected. I wasn't sure I would watch any more. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The highlight of Tuesday afternoon was a Facetime call with my dear friend Kathy and husband Phil who live in Keighley. We spoke for an hour and a half and it was nearly as if we were together but of course we weren't. Can't wait for this damned pandemic to be over so that we can see each other again and can travel. My body and heart are dying for a trip to Yorkshire and their bodies and hearts are dying for a trip to Spain.  For the moment we can only dream as we don't know when travel will resume, especially travel to the UK. This week the UK government announced that all arrivals from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-measures-to-protect-the-uk-from-variant-strains-of-covid-19#travel-bans-to-the-uk---banned-countries">33</a> red zone countries will have to quarantine for 10 days at a ghastly Travel Lodge Hotel and pay for the duration. Well I wouldn't do that and wonder if anyone will. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjY5xVv9B3l1Sn6yW9tnZzLkN3lzqRzkkypB2NxbTt_WZwIQ53D_KycPzUDK_tXo_zOQtm95n_x44VjjxJE4hN-TeQNQcAO6Z8r5pQqM-JfBY_Row4PpqPeqhD-UdUTTknW8FaVRQ/s961/international-travel-guide-infographic.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="266" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjY5xVv9B3l1Sn6yW9tnZzLkN3lzqRzkkypB2NxbTt_WZwIQ53D_KycPzUDK_tXo_zOQtm95n_x44VjjxJE4hN-TeQNQcAO6Z8r5pQqM-JfBY_Row4PpqPeqhD-UdUTTknW8FaVRQ/w400-h266/international-travel-guide-infographic.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Latest travel restrictions for arrivals in the UK</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Government went as far as threatening travellers who lied about their country of origin with a 10 year prison sentence! This had everyone up in arms. It's ridiculous. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Wednesday was a quiet day as most days are. We didn't have any errands to do and enjoyed our walk in the sun although the path was very muddy from so much rain. We are now into the middle of February and we have noticed that the days are getting longer. In Madrid, at least, sunrise is now at around 08.15 and dusk at 19.00. Roll on 28th March when the clocks go forward and bring longer hours of sunlight, especially in the evenings. Oli joined us for lunch that day, without Elliot. It was strange to see her without our little baby who was at the nursery and no doubt had a big lunch too. Later in the day the three of them were going to see another flat in their house seeking project. It's exciting to think they may have their own house soon. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">That day the vaccination programme in Spain included for the first time the use of the Oxford vaccine, the one countries seem to have so many doubts about. Just under 200.000 doses arrived this week. The doubts stem from the fact that the studies done did not include people over 65 and the company's own statement that its vaccine is not efficient against the so-called South African variant. Later in the day, the WHO, disputed this, backing the British made vaccine as well as agreeing to the British strategy of giving it in two doses, eight to twelve weeks apart. According to the WHO, the "efficacy of the vaccines is higher when the second dose is administered later". I am a bit fed up with so many changes in recommendations such as those or about masks, aerosols and now vaccines. What are we to believe? In Spain the Oxford vaccine is only being administered to people over 55. As I keep saying, I am still waiting for my father to get his first jab. Why is this so slow?  The EU Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen actually admitted on Wednesday the vaccine roll out failures and apologised. She also pointed out that if there hadn't been an organised purchase on behalf of all the EU countries, there would have been a country scramble and war to procure the vaccine. I think she is right on this but I'm very cross about the slow roll out.  It's not slow in the UK where over 13 million have  been given a vaccine (figures for this Tuesday).  The problem facing Boris Johnson now is getting the 2 million over 70's reluctant to receive a jab. The other problem is the low uptake by members of the "BAME" community. For those not familiar with this acronym it means "black, asian and minority ethnic". This is especially worrying as the percentage of those affected by the virus in the UK is higher in this group than in any other. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">Thursday came and as usual I had my breakfast reading the headlines. At 8 am sharp I switch on the RTVE streaming app to watch Oli reporting and presenting in her programme, "La Hora de la 1". One of the topics she included that morning was the beginning of the impeachment process against Donald Trump. Here she is on screen next to his ugly mug.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhh-yyRFnzn_vgZ8beTdWlBT9ctfzZb3Uo-HeLZQp1i13bw-m3EL1bUtmxo0gsT6E4zPylFtZaPQkZc5Kskk3iKw0wCTi_WVmTOyan8rgJyc03_ku1zXiQnI5fCiHDjyhirmxR9-A/s2543/Thursday+Oli+Trump+impeachment+new+images.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhh-yyRFnzn_vgZ8beTdWlBT9ctfzZb3Uo-HeLZQp1i13bw-m3EL1bUtmxo0gsT6E4zPylFtZaPQkZc5Kskk3iKw0wCTi_WVmTOyan8rgJyc03_ku1zXiQnI5fCiHDjyhirmxR9-A/w400-h195/Thursday+Oli+Trump+impeachment+new+images.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My daughter reporting on the impeachment of Trump</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">New images emerged during the trial showing awful footage of Trump's fanatical supporters attacking the Capitol. It is obvious Trump is responsible for this terrible attack on democracy but he would get away with it again as 17 votes from the Republicans were needed for him to be impeached, something which was highly unlikely. He did get away with it too when his was absolved on Saturday. I seriously thing he should have sat before a civilian trial for inciting the violence at the Capitol and not at an impeachment trial where biased political parties vote. </div></div><div><br></br></div><div>I watched Oli's programme with more interest than usual as the day before "La Hora de La 1" was in trouble for a supposed error. It happened while a story was being told about Princess Leonor, daughter of the King of Spain and next in line to the throne. The story was that she would be studying in Wales at the very  exclusive  UWC Atlantic College, next term. So far so good until a headline appeared on the screen with these words "Leonor is leaving Spain, like her grandfather".  Some people took this as an attack on the Crown. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_jPFG7xTq4Cwiags2UH4t4M2hBDsVYi6mNlejU-nz968N7Bxsn8wn35pDIYxXy5q5PhilbdLf_HBf8mTwwYWd_mgeK_KzpXu9DPlaGuqas7HQbER80BJS-nteG4UHVFmHZpqCCw/s656/Leonor-tve-656x368.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg_jPFG7xTq4Cwiags2UH4t4M2hBDsVYi6mNlejU-nz968N7Bxsn8wn35pDIYxXy5q5PhilbdLf_HBf8mTwwYWd_mgeK_KzpXu9DPlaGuqas7HQbER80BJS-nteG4UHVFmHZpqCCw/w400-h225/Leonor-tve-656x368.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The unfortunate headline: "Leonor is leaving Spain, like her grandfather"</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;">Her grandfather is ex King Juan Carlos who is currently in exile in Dubai hiding from scandals about his finances.  This comparison was soon trending topic and even reached parliament as well as newspapers abroad with criticism of RTVE growing for attacking the crown.  Immediately Spain's national broadcaster issued an apology regretting the mistake and that measures were being taken to relieve those responsible of their positions. I asked Oli what had happened and she told me the mistake was made by the scriptwriter and him only and that he had not intentionally meant to attack the crown. He was later dismissed,  a pawn in a ridiculous story made bigger than it really was.  She was sorry for him and so was I. I can imagine him realising the consequences of his action and regretting it for the rest of his life. Oli told me he  did not mean to attack the crown but his misjudgment in writing that headline gave the public and opposition party ammunition to attack the corporation. I now know the story behind this scandal firsthand, something the public doesn't know and it makes me wonder how real are kother scandals are that are often used as political ammunition. His name, by the way is now out of the bag; Bernat Barrachina and he is now on the dole. Not fair right. He posted on his twitter feed that he had been fired like Princess Leonor's grandfather. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjmhBB5JaPoelDQ4amWlunjh5h5z3ydrcL-Aa9P0BRFWteV41eACZtWEdrWzN0QB0w49N6WqbpDIo2koWaDCgqeegqD-pMukTmj3eg003Ai8q9hQsEM8hPJjZ19jc6o3G8RtT-Iag/s608/bbcg.png" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="366" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjmhBB5JaPoelDQ4amWlunjh5h5z3ydrcL-Aa9P0BRFWteV41eACZtWEdrWzN0QB0w49N6WqbpDIo2koWaDCgqeegqD-pMukTmj3eg003Ai8q9hQsEM8hPJjZ19jc6o3G8RtT-Iag/w400-h366/bbcg.png" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The tweet from the scriptwriter who has lost his job over the offending headline about Princess Leonor. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>I hope he finds a job soon. I couldn't watch the rest of the programme as we  had to go out in the morning to give my Criminal Records check document with its Hague Apostille to my lawyer and to retrieve my passport. This is the lawyer dealing with my request for Spanish nationality. I had thought the paperwork was over but it wasn't. It should be now. After this I shall just have to sit and wait for about a year before the ok comes through. There is no doubt it will come through after so many years in Spain and married to a Spaniard but it will take as long as a year. What a bore. But first we went to the chemist and then I persuaded Eladio to come with me to see a small demonstration of people outside our local Mercadona - the ubiquitous low cost supermarket in Spain. It appears it is to shut to the public and turn into a logistic platform for online sales and the neighbours in this area are up in arms. We are not only upset it will close to the public but furious to see a logistics platform in a residential area. That day some of the residents had organised a small demonstration and had called the media. I had to have a look and here I am in the fog and cold with not many people around. In fact it seemed there were more policemen then demonstrators. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHuqbjDTTF1WB17qhiSIdzSQecJY2IS6c-tuXylPWfLOBNV9bn-Hnma2Lqu8W_KaegyfYkyKoNrdrITAzbRglEUJ-3HUJzkoM2x_9gMvzv3PJNvRx6HA16cXAKFXG73LQE2ceSLA/s2543/Thursday+me+mani.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHuqbjDTTF1WB17qhiSIdzSQecJY2IS6c-tuXylPWfLOBNV9bn-Hnma2Lqu8W_KaegyfYkyKoNrdrITAzbRglEUJ-3HUJzkoM2x_9gMvzv3PJNvRx6HA16cXAKFXG73LQE2ceSLA/w400-h195/Thursday+me+mani.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Outside our local Mercadona to see the small group of protesters on Thursday morning. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;">I have very few hopes of the residents' protests coming to anything as Mercadona is a giant company and they will get their way for sure. We drove off on my mission to Madrid to meet my lawyer. I handed her the coveted criminal check record with its Hague Apostille which she was supposed to give in the next day to add to all my papers for Spanish nationality. I had asked her before if it needed to be translated by a certified translator, a question she failed to answer. I mentioned it again on Thursday and she admitted sheepishly that it would need translating. Thus she would not be submitting the document the next day. Agggh, I do feel as though my lawyer, apart from slow, is rather incompetent.  I also asked her if she knew if our post Brexit residency cards would be ready, something she promised to let me know. Well, she had forgotten that too and it was up to me to get two appointments to pick them up. I managed the complicated online process and now have a date; 22nd February, but no thanks to my lawyer. I can't fire her now as we are in the middle of the process of requesting nationality nor can I show my annoyance as there is no point getting her back up. Better to keep the peace but I would not recommend her to anyone. Funny thing is she came highly recommended by a Jill, US friend who got Spanish nationality through her. Anyway, sorry to bore you with this. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was too late for our walk when we got back and it was raining. Oli joined us for lunch again, on her own - we missed Elliot - but left soon after lunch. I have to admit that on that day I binge watched about 5 episodes of the final season, season 8 of one of my very favourite TV series, Homeland. Oh it was great to be back in the company of Carrie and Saul. I had missed them.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Friday 12th February would have been my brother George's 66th birthday. I always remember him but especially on the day of his birthday and on the anniversary of his death, 15th May. How could I ever forget?  If you haven't seen it, this is what I wrote that day: "<span style="background-color: white; color: #050505; font-size: 15px; text-align: left; white-space: pre-wrap;"><i>Remembering George my brother. It's his birthday today and he would have been 66. Life took him too early, aged just 46 and I miss him every day. I miss my 6ft tall, handsome, blonde, blue eyed and talented brother who could pick up languages so fast, who could play the piano and guitar and write music and who was a natural for sport. He would talk on equal terms to anyone from prince to pauper and was born with itchy feet. He once hitch hiked to Afghanistan and got cholera there. He got lost and robbed in his travels to Latin America and it was always a joy and relief to have him home safe. I remember our talks late into the night. There were bad times too. He had a sad dark side and got schizophrenia but still the sparkle in his beautiful blue eyes came through some times.  Life did not hand him good cards. I forever feel guilty I got the best deal. Life is so unfair. God bless my beautiful golden brother. I think of you every day and carry you in my heart.</i>" </span>My consolation is exactly that; I carry him in my heart. I don't have many photos with him and I wish I had more but here are three of us, when we very young with my father, a beautiful photo taken in Norwich by an Italian photographer and another one of us, both wearing hats, at the pretty little village of Guadalest in the county of Alicante. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgtvUeuI5WJwBa9mP9Gs0-rw_hXY1y5DLlnnjPJUedVt-yUGHhQB5ln-LPlQ2yQ0yZ0cdJD0PADXKhBqblaE54TsRJPVHzTdMmuwtACFJbNmR3huaT-wuRyRMVs2RfsSV_aQKYQyA/s1600/CCL+with+George+and+Masha+Ruskington+c1961.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgtvUeuI5WJwBa9mP9Gs0-rw_hXY1y5DLlnnjPJUedVt-yUGHhQB5ln-LPlQ2yQ0yZ0cdJD0PADXKhBqblaE54TsRJPVHzTdMmuwtACFJbNmR3huaT-wuRyRMVs2RfsSV_aQKYQyA/w311-h400/CCL+with+George+and+Masha+Ruskington+c1961.jpg" width="311"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>In Ruskington as children with our father</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgbpkXPzVahv-HuFSdQ2PzvhuIofFxMTV1ktvwPP0Tibk6OW72bun6k2_RS6Y1_UTFPBgJdZAiDOePkjFEnllADcScCgTTrqdEp-wjT_J6jc_Splvr1vWGgSMWtbE2wTrpCysCb7A/s1600/George+and+me+Callosa.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="260" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgbpkXPzVahv-HuFSdQ2PzvhuIofFxMTV1ktvwPP0Tibk6OW72bun6k2_RS6Y1_UTFPBgJdZAiDOePkjFEnllADcScCgTTrqdEp-wjT_J6jc_Splvr1vWGgSMWtbE2wTrpCysCb7A/w400-h260/George+and+me+Callosa.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Happy times in Guadalest near Callosa (Alicante)</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMkUSk5yWqYNfW17DU6G4SD1AZAqxfLeGnFx2XmmpOYoWC1VcmJqLSDzFf10XeDNysB7igIK4WnAIjhG0O9XsajTOcuhtw7HTzEv5KaOUVU_Io0qheRVD8dPQHmvmDRBoRaLatgw/s490/Me+and+George+Norwich+Russian+Courses+mid+70%2527s.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMkUSk5yWqYNfW17DU6G4SD1AZAqxfLeGnFx2XmmpOYoWC1VcmJqLSDzFf10XeDNysB7igIK4WnAIjhG0O9XsajTOcuhtw7HTzEv5KaOUVU_Io0qheRVD8dPQHmvmDRBoRaLatgw/w304-h400/Me+and+George+Norwich+Russian+Courses+mid+70%2527s.jpg" width="304"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The two of us probably aged 20 and 22. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">At lunch that day I mentioned to my father that it would have been George's birthday and my father knew, answering "12th February". Our birthdays are very close, mine on the 8th and George's on 12th February. I remember as children receiving a birthday card each from our grandmother on my father's side, with a whole pound note in it. A pound went a long way in the early 60's I can tell you. She would also send us a birthday cake she had probably made herself which we always looked forward to.

It's our weekly excursion. We hardly ever go out apart from to shop. Oh how I miss travelling. George, my itchy feet brother, would not have borne lockdown very well, I know. After we had finished we went to have a coffee at our favourite café which is also a cake shop and bakery; Alverán. I couldn't resist some heart shaped cakes filled with whipped cream for St. Valentine's Day. As I shopped I thought about how to celebrate it as of course we can't go out for dinner. We could as restaurants are open but we don't want to risk going inside. That's why we have our coffees out at a table in the street, to avoid the dangerous aerosols that spread Covid. In the end I decided to make a cake myself, a heart shaped one, for today. The small heart shaped cakes from Alveran were for pre-St. Valentine's celebrations hahaha. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhukh8653Yf7vX2iyPNApy-deuWb2aCM9tVXsFzSKOZ_vRYhOFKKtq-XvLT2BQuBydK7MHIm7MO9BzxyMNokM25L9voHmbpNliuHZxuH604i7N7_Ssm-bvOQhgX1KjUZ78H2rfxsw/s2543/Friday+St+V+cakes.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhukh8653Yf7vX2iyPNApy-deuWb2aCM9tVXsFzSKOZ_vRYhOFKKtq-XvLT2BQuBydK7MHIm7MO9BzxyMNokM25L9voHmbpNliuHZxuH604i7N7_Ssm-bvOQhgX1KjUZ78H2rfxsw/w400-h195/Friday+St+V+cakes.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The heart shaped and whipped cream filled cakes from Alverán, our favourite cake shop</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We had a quiet lunch and were not joined by Oli that day. She had had another busy morning, appearing non stop on her TV programme where she starts work at 5 in the morning. I watch her whenever I can. That day saw her reporting on the words uttered by our communist Vice President of the government, the pony tailed Pablo Iglesias. He has been much in the news this week, the week running up to the blasted elections in Catalonia taking place today which always cause friction. He said in a radio programme that full political and democractic normality is not present in Spain. He was referring to the Catalan independence leaders being in prison for calling an illegal referendum. Well, they are hardly in prison now as they are out and about campaigning and only sleep in prison at the weekends or not even that and, excuse me, but they did break the law. Other constitutional political party leaders and members disputed his words and I dispute them too. I have lived here for many years and this is a full democracy, with its flaws of course but a democracy. Many called for his dismissal. I wish he would go too.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjHyeyKsTDRx3MEjEUETqFhU2A1IVUlnmgeNDd1U3jC9UzUOGkmPvXEPHrDpVYyd5SoEwr2uVCZc6uwjXHgipJYuI6aXNfp0HEi9DKlIjMpw0NTd3nZT2seEnpuTbv4w5ph2g1Gkg/s2543/Friday+Oli+with+Pablo+Iglesias.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjHyeyKsTDRx3MEjEUETqFhU2A1IVUlnmgeNDd1U3jC9UzUOGkmPvXEPHrDpVYyd5SoEwr2uVCZc6uwjXHgipJYuI6aXNfp0HEi9DKlIjMpw0NTd3nZT2seEnpuTbv4w5ph2g1Gkg/w400-h195/Friday+Oli+with+Pablo+Iglesias.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Olivia with the ugly mug of Pablo Iglesias in the background</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div style="text-align: justify;">Oli, tired and also fed up of the pandemic - as we all are - came with her little family to spend the afternoon and the night with us. It was great to see Elliot again. I had a present for him, another baby book. This one is about the jungle with real jungle sounds and he loves it. He was chuckling with glee at each sound and as he turned the pages.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjd5Thdopk4Ki4VDm1Ju_B9osihja6tHW0-_2YiKiHIVQS7oG4NgrWGxSNZQJQPC5crAqltrNFtHSrRKMyFDhbrKI4m5vVXZQ4zFnhfSXqKiWxQdZImKa4fttx-vt7_lBIOuC4qGQ/s2543/20210212_203551.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjd5Thdopk4Ki4VDm1Ju_B9osihja6tHW0-_2YiKiHIVQS7oG4NgrWGxSNZQJQPC5crAqltrNFtHSrRKMyFDhbrKI4m5vVXZQ4zFnhfSXqKiWxQdZImKa4fttx-vt7_lBIOuC4qGQ/w400-h195/20210212_203551.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Elliot enjoying the new book I bought him with jungle sounds</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">He loved his new book but still insisted I read him The very hungry caterpillar a few times hahahahaha. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In order to cheer Oli up I had promised her an afternoon and evening of love with a special dinner because of St. Valentines. I served croquettes, foie, Iberian ham, artichokes and runner beans. Then we had the cake, half a piece each as the piece de resistance. Eladio was the only one not to eat his. He is not into cakes hahahaha. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We all went to bed early so that day there was no binge watching Homeland and both Eladio and I fell asleep watching a film called Ellis Island which didn't convince. We soon fell asleep.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">On Saturday I woke up at 6.45 and was the one to feed the dogs. Would you believe that it was one year ago yesterday that the first person died of Covid in Spain. I don't know his name but do know he had travelled to Nepal and was admitted into hospital in Valencia. When he died, we just expected a few cases and not much more but my goodness we had no idea what was coming. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Oli and co went off house seeking, Eladio, Pippa, Norah and I went for our walk and I came home to make a family lunch.  I made my red lentil soup followed by spaghetti carbonara. I think we were all craving pasta except for my father and Eladio who are what I describe as "potato men" (hahahaha). I spent a lot of quality time with 16 month old Elliot yesterday and he and I are forming a wonderful bond. He just loves it when I sit on the carpet with him playing with his toys. They left in the early evening as they had a dinner date at their home. He was with me too when I made the Victoria Sponge cake for St. Valentine's. It came out a treat although sagged a bit in the middle. The solution was just to turn it on its back. I will decorate it today.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEie9OpQ0hRIWt5_rQWVzyB1TFdQAQOSg8L2RpiU3EubaA_scMmAboSRLinYUaCUZMRSCmhnZBMTPon5smDXXpReDAfVI718SROqV7UwztTwBE2KFQlw3NQqwk8WH7jqNrWgF4JtKA/s1440/Heat+shaped+cake.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="350" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEie9OpQ0hRIWt5_rQWVzyB1TFdQAQOSg8L2RpiU3EubaA_scMmAboSRLinYUaCUZMRSCmhnZBMTPon5smDXXpReDAfVI718SROqV7UwztTwBE2KFQlw3NQqwk8WH7jqNrWgF4JtKA/w400-h350/Heat+shaped+cake.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My heart shaped Victoria sponge cake for St. Valentine's which I shall decorate today. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was when I was watching the cake in the oven that  Eladio spotted Elsa our labrador who is recovering from her knee ligament operation and  has a lingering mouth infection, had a swollen eye or eyelid. We were alarmed and hoped the mouth infection had not spread. My husband immediately took her to the vet - thank God it's open 24/7. She was administered Urbason - that life saving strong cortisone which helps reduce inflammation. We have to give her some drops too and tomorrow Eladio will take her back to the vet. She is not doing well and we feel so sorry for her. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I couldn't accompany my husband for Covid reasons (damn the virus) so he went on his own. I had an hour to myself before dinner and used it to watch more of Homeland Season 8. I would watch the remaining 30 minutes of it in an amazing finale in bed that night. It is supposed to be the last season but in my mind the ending gives me hope it may be continued. I then turned to another spy series, The Amercans, which I had watched about 5 years ago but wanted to revisit. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">And today is Sunday and St. Valentine's Day so I wish you all lots of love. Share it my friends. I shall be telling you about our day in next week's post.
