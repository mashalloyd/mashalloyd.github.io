Is the week really over? How can it be? It went so fast. When you are  enjoying life time always flies doesn't it? But we packed lots in and this has been a holiday to remember.<div><br></br></div><div>It was also the week Hamas, the Gaza terrorist group, attacked Israel, provoking out and out war. The Israelis never saw it coming and neither did anyone else. Last weekend the terrorists launched their unprecedented attack which started at a rave party where hundreds were killed. More were killed by multiple rocket blasts and the worst of all, almost 150 people were kidnapped from kibbutzum and settlement areas including children and old people. Some of those killed were beheaded. This echoes Nazism I'm afraid and I am with Israel.  Since then the tensions have increased and there is out and out war in Israel which is very destabilising for an area which is  permanent hot pot. It is being likened to Yon Kipur which I remember as a child some 50 years ago.  It is said the attack comes after agreement  talks with Israel and Saudi Arabia and that Gaza is being backed by Iran, a common enemy in the Middle East and everywhere. Otherwise, how could Hamas on its own take on the mighty Israeli Army. Hamas couldn't have done this without help. Now Israel is retaliating, hoping to get the the hostages which I think is mission impossible. Whatever they do, they will be criticised. <br></br><p>Sandra my friend is of Jewish origin and was appalled. I was too.She remarked that few people on social media were standing up for Israel. I am though and immediately posted "My heart goes out to Israel". I wrote to Kelly, my ex Nokia colleague who is from Tel Aviv. She wrote back to say she was on holiday in Ireland and that it had turned into a nightmare and added "I can't believe what I hear and see it is inhuman and barbaric. My family is OK in Tel Aviv, thank God. Can't wait to be back home with my people and try to contribute to the effort. Those poor, poor, captive families; little children taken whose parents were massacred, youngsters, soldiers, ... Masha please pray for their rescue"</p><p>The war hovered over us the whole week but as you know, life goes on and it could not spoil our long planned week together. Sandra and Adele, my bosom friends from Nottingham University where we met in the first year in 1976, arrived the Saturday before last as you will know if you read last week's blog post.</p><p>That day we tried to do some shopping but it was Sunday, so not so easy. From the Udine supermarket I drove them to Santa Pola, our nearest town, along the old coastal road which I had to show to them as it is simply gorgeous.</p><p>We parked near the castle and went to have coffee and cake in the square. Here are my dear friends at the cafe last Sunday. We had our coffee with a locally made "ensaimada" similar but not the same as brioche. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5IbxS15PFw3TfEgDwKMZbPpiMX1W45u86A-eJ_f6ydF1xZ0U4nUZD_UEe-2tPp9Sdd023GfXSoAMJtIPcc4VWrMoWOwAWnFgEz8vvDMqb_sw8aW-8qr9_yJ02TrwXIxbXCCa1tUNduL78SRB2RGXUL1qzyidYuLk3A4nen1mnf6BB_XK-cLw_DA/s4032/20231008_114034.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5IbxS15PFw3TfEgDwKMZbPpiMX1W45u86A-eJ_f6ydF1xZ0U4nUZD_UEe-2tPp9Sdd023GfXSoAMJtIPcc4VWrMoWOwAWnFgEz8vvDMqb_sw8aW-8qr9_yJ02TrwXIxbXCCa1tUNduL78SRB2RGXUL1qzyidYuLk3A4nen1mnf6BB_XK-cLw_DA/w400-h180/20231008_114034.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Coffee and cake time in Santa Pola last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We then walked towards the port but got waylaid at a boutique called La Casa where my friends bought lots of clothes. We turned it into a party, laughing and fooling around and started talking to a lovely Spanish woman - a teacher of English from Elche who lives in Murcia. She dressed beautifully and we hit it off immediately. She was just our kind of woman. Sandra and Adele went back twice afterwards. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Eventually we walked to the port although we came back to the shop (La Casa) where Adele got another dress hahaha. I didn't as I am far too fat. I waited outside on a bench in the shade and a lady from Elche  sat next to me.  When she got up she looked at me and said "oh you are so beautiful, you look like a  a princess. Was your mother a princess?" I as astonished and laughingly said yes. She certainly gave me an up. That is the second lady to comment something similar recently. Thank you ladies you made me feel so much better.</div><div><br></br></div><div>We came home to find Suzy making our lunch again. She is such a darling. It was  a make yourself tuna fish salad after which we all chilled out. The weather was great as it has been the whole time and around 5 pm I took my friends down to the beach. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We took our chairs down but forgot our towels except for Sandra hahaha. The beach was quite full being a Sunday and bank holiday but not crowded. We made a beeline for the lovely, calm and clean water and then my friends went "walking in the sea". Here they are in the distance. <br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikYK1UnhaBtvSc_YVruRmcZwwnT6NdIOg6BZsjlmihvdVCrcar4rAh_x4u3HGtZflEvy2WPi-p2PvJQ-UtBfXT5zRWcyNMpQQ6bcVs0Ex5sGpgT1vWWpEh8rSZvZh4l0w29J_sJGWg8zpayQZ0DDhE7cFkcwFFMarfQpQbScb9pFPD_z9_oq7Jzw/s4032/20231008_172748.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEikYK1UnhaBtvSc_YVruRmcZwwnT6NdIOg6BZsjlmihvdVCrcar4rAh_x4u3HGtZflEvy2WPi-p2PvJQ-UtBfXT5zRWcyNMpQQ6bcVs0Ex5sGpgT1vWWpEh8rSZvZh4l0w29J_sJGWg8zpayQZ0DDhE7cFkcwFFMarfQpQbScb9pFPD_z9_oq7Jzw/w400-h180/20231008_172748.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The girls "walking in the sea" last Sunday afternoon</i></td></tr></tbody></table>When they finally emerged I took them on a long walk to the end of the beach, as far as the rocks.

In 1700 it was known as St. Paul's island as it is said the apostle disembarked there once. It was a refuge for Barbary pirates until the end of the 18th century and a base for raids on the Levante coast. It was once part of the Republic of Genoa until it was conquered by Bey of Tunisia in 1741. However, Charles III of Spain conquered it in 1760. The people of the island spoke Genoese because, according to legend, .a group of Genoese sailors were shipwrecked and settled there. Amazing story right? Today it lives off fishing and tourism. It is a beautifully kept little island, half of which is built up on which comprises the small village. Here are my friends just before we disembarked. <br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqxjbJZHbnP8-zd5HJ0Bq7iR7hzVbMw2Dh1r8Kq5lGNdAtYangFjFVX-HlWX-0WYCT6iTHR5kYgxZ60gugY1n3jM7VZttXGF9zeYuGirXmCqpkOAOgxq7FReeTGAaBO2fw-F8dP_HFT2nmnUPEQsPn_CTi9kDtPzq5OE2cygCV_A_-LbI0h8yM3A/s4032/20231009_124750.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqxjbJZHbnP8-zd5HJ0Bq7iR7hzVbMw2Dh1r8Kq5lGNdAtYangFjFVX-HlWX-0WYCT6iTHR5kYgxZ60gugY1n3jM7VZttXGF9zeYuGirXmCqpkOAOgxq7FReeTGAaBO2fw-F8dP_HFT2nmnUPEQsPn_CTi9kDtPzq5OE2cygCV_A_-LbI0h8yM3A/w180-h400/20231009_124750.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>About to disembark on the island of Tabarca</i></td></tr></tbody></table>I have been many times so was my friends' guide for the day.

The next day, <b>Tuesday</b>, I was taking my friends to my old stomping ground, Callosa, Algar and Bolulla. It was in Callosa  in 1972 that my mother bought a house for a thousand pounds and my Aunty Masha a house in Bolulla for 500 with a donkey in it. Those were our "Callosa Days" which you can read more about <a href="http://mashalloyd.blogspot.com/2008/12/aunty-masha-laid-to-rest-russian.html">here</a>. That post is about Aunty Masha being laid to rest but it is also about how Spain became part of our lives and how I came to live here. I could never have known in 1972 that I would marry a Spaniard and eventually live here. Those years from 1972 to around the time I got married in 1983 were happy years. We would come every summer and bring friends from around the world. We revelled in rural and poor but beautiful Spain in Franco's time and after he died when progress began and we learned the language. So I was keen to take my friends to "my villages", Callosa and Bolulla, where also my love for Eladio began. We fell in love there in the summer of 1980 and, as you know, the rest is history.</div><div><br></br></div><div>It's a long drive but worth it across the coast.

My Aunt started the trend by telling all her friends and on our visit there this week we were told by a young Lithuanian couple that today there are 28 nationalities in Bolulla. Imagine.  That is something amazing for such a small village. It is surrounded by orange groves and other fruit trees which was how the villagers made their living.

What a divine place. I have been coming for years yet Las Fuentes de Algar always give me a thrill and I love to take people there.<div><br></br></div><div>We came down feeling thoroughly refreshed. I had 89km to drive home but we stopped en route at Lidl in La Nucia for more provisions - primarily rose wine for my friends (and me).</div><div><br></br></div><div>Dinner was on the table, courtesy of Suzy, when we got home. Thank you darling. We then chilled out on the terrace with a glass or two of chilled wine. What a wonderful day we had.</div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Wednesday</b> dawned and all we wanted to do that morning was to spend it on the beach. We did that after my handyman, Bernardo, came to fix  a few things in the apartment. My girls love our beach and I do too. We swam several times and then walked to the far end. On our way back we stopped for a coffee at one of the beach bars. We ordered 3 cappuccinos but were astounded when the bill came to over 16 euros at 5.50 euros per cup!  Coffee in Spain costs approximately 1.5 euros to 2 euros and a smart place will charge 2.5 but never in my life in Spain have I paid 5.5. Even Sandra and Adele who live in Brussels and in France thought it was scandalous. It was extortionate and similar to prices paid in Switzerland. I know we were paying for location but the other bars further along charged 2.5. So, what a rip off from "Conviction Beach Club Bar". Never again. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Soon it was time for lunch and we slowly made our way back, had our showers and sat down to eat bits and bobs from whatever was in the fridge. The pièce de résistance was Sandra's home made guacamole. After some leisure time, we were out again. Sandra and Adele were keen to visit Alicante, the capital of the province which is about 18km from here so quite a short drive. We found an underground car park not far from the famous <a href="https://www.alicanteturismo.com/en/explanada-de-espana/">Explanada</a> - Alicante's version of Barcelona's Las Ramblas, but far quieter. It is the city's most famous claim to fame after the Castle of Santa Barbara. Designed by architects Miguel López and Alfonso Fajardo, it was built in 1959 and was inspired by the Copacabana Boulevard. It runs parallel to the port and is lined with rows of palm trees. The floor is decorated with over 6 million tricolour marble tiles which forms a mosaic wave effect. I have been there hundreds of times but it never fails to impress me. <br></br><div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiOhtq0mWv2apC_rxIq4B3_CjAPaTB66vAN2-ODAJBd8LDm8s7JtPI897h6It5LCSljzEXBOUCk2B18j9RFav8lqpDx3UfZsfqCQ1A7SAB8IUoVh3-d_sgV4Kd7w2aqyKxG9P6Qaspe-ksgxrdY6qgWWh2Ttzzhgj64VdjctZXsyHc5W35COObuDA/s2048/IMG-20231011-WA0026.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiOhtq0mWv2apC_rxIq4B3_CjAPaTB66vAN2-ODAJBd8LDm8s7JtPI897h6It5LCSljzEXBOUCk2B18j9RFav8lqpDx3UfZsfqCQ1A7SAB8IUoVh3-d_sgV4Kd7w2aqyKxG9P6Qaspe-ksgxrdY6qgWWh2Ttzzhgj64VdjctZXsyHc5W35COObuDA/w300-h400/IMG-20231011-WA0026.jpg" width="300"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>On the Explanada with Adele on Wednesday night</i></td></tr></tbody></table>At the end is Kiosko Peret, its most famous terrace bar which serves divine ice cream and horchata - ground almond/tiger nut milk.

So what is that you may ask? As it's so difficult to explain I have copied the answer from Wikipedia: "<span style="background-color: white; color: #4d5156; font-size: 14px;">A mascletà is a pyrotechnic event characterized by the achievement of a noisy and rhythmic composition that features, particularly during daytime, in street festivities; it is typical of the Valencian Community. It gets its name from the masclets that are tied by a wick to form a line or firework display"</span><br></br><div><br></br><div>These are very popular in the Valencia region which is firework mad. In the old days I remember seeing people with missing limbs and hands and scarred bodies from manhandling fireworks. Today there is much more security. The whole place was cordoned off so no one would get burnt.  But the Mascletá, a word from the local dialect of Valenciano, wasn't starting until 1. It was to be preceded by some sort of town hall declaration with the Guardia Civil involved. I later read the party that governs in Santa Pola is the right wing PP and that the mayor is a woman, so was not surprised when I heard things like "viva España" and "viva la Guardia Civil". You see Spain is divided politically as it always has been and unfortunately a sense of pride of national belonging is seen as right wing. Even the use of the Spanish flag is seen as "fascist" and is only approved by the left wing for football and over sporting activities which is a huge pity. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Anyway, before the mascletá, we had time on our hands and my friends were keen to visit the clothes shops. Sandra and I found Adele in a lovely boutique called "El Armario de Carlitos" on the main street. I was in no mood for clothes shopping but the boutique was amazing with all their clothes sourced from places like Istanbul or Florence. I got talking to the assistant, a lovely woman called Natalia who is a great saleswoman. The girls brought patchwork jackets but then Natalia brought out the most divine black jacket with white spots which I could not resist. Neither could two other ladies. We all got talking and the whole episode turned into a spontaneous clothes buying party. We had to have photos. Here is one of that great experience.

This time we were charged a reasonable 2 euros per cup. We left around 1 pm to get some provisions for lunch and on our way to Unide (local supermarket) we picked up Suzy. My daughter, kindly, made us our midday meal.<div><br></br></div><div>Later we played sevens again and for the record my friends, I won which is always satisfying. But frankly I don't care whether I win or lose. I just liked playing with my friends. I always loved card playing but have no one to play with in Spain. <br></br><div><br></br></div><div>We were having dinner in Elche that night so I took my friends to see this historical walled city, so influenced by the Moors in Spain.  Elche is the second largest town in the province in Alicante and is considered the shoe capital of Spain. It is famous for its palm trees - the Palmeral de Elche  which is an UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the only palm grove in Europe with North African origins and the largest on the continent. Within the "plameral" there is a beautiful park called "El Huerto del Cura" which we visited. It is a magical place and contains a unique tree, the Imperial Palm Tree, the only one of its kind in the world. This is because it has seven "suckers" that have grown symmetrically from the main trunk. A kind visitor took our picture.</div><div><br></br></div><div> <table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhaLap-5uQ6t3J29vEaXx-05Uq8Eju_t3EMxGVzxmlaAWaUWJF_gQUifQVbMD5x2EwYJZFZjQ5u23Q8vjwLCtV1ywHM8PmAbmLTcp-nzpDCYYLyJrWzWA-z9Qt2yzhIQE7PbggVEE-H2-PwjzQkXazu5YONbQwjVMOKjZhyX_EwJrVm-4Pw6aEtzQ/s1024/IMG-20231013-WA0015.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhaLap-5uQ6t3J29vEaXx-05Uq8Eju_t3EMxGVzxmlaAWaUWJF_gQUifQVbMD5x2EwYJZFZjQ5u23Q8vjwLCtV1ywHM8PmAbmLTcp-nzpDCYYLyJrWzWA-z9Qt2yzhIQE7PbggVEE-H2-PwjzQkXazu5YONbQwjVMOKjZhyX_EwJrVm-4Pw6aEtzQ/w300-h400/IMG-20231013-WA0015.jpg" width="300"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>By the Imperial Palm Tree at the Huerto del Cura park which is part of the huge palm tree grove which makes Elche famous. </i></td></tr></tbody></table>We actually bought some of the fresh dates from the park which had been picked that morning. They are delicious. </div><div><br></br></div><div>From El Huerto del Cura which means The Priest's orchard, we walked into the main town. It is partially surrounded by Islamic stone walls from the times Spain was under the Moorish yoke. No wonder there is so much Islamic influence in Spain.  We walked through one of the main squares, La Glorieta; which was teeming with people and atmosphere with palm trees everywhere, on our way to show my friends the Basílica of Santa Maria. It is the most beautiful baroque cathedral where a famous religious musical play is performed every August called The Mystery of Elche. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgmZUiiELwWBNxdYwxqiEGeAVqylxvA00NbmUCoFaRngBH8BJBqMc-VMsHIIlykUI91MyOWfFBe08kRryQa-eATecdCL9DolM6wLE__UKQKNjc3b07srZoT1uzMfnkB5s5YMFIuLfYqI9Zp5BS-rIfgXTOWyYcDjF8lEUQf4PAbqk2Xh0FdasKVjg/s800/800px-Bas%C3%ADlica_de_Santa_Mar%C3%ADa_Elche.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="365" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgmZUiiELwWBNxdYwxqiEGeAVqylxvA00NbmUCoFaRngBH8BJBqMc-VMsHIIlykUI91MyOWfFBe08kRryQa-eATecdCL9DolM6wLE__UKQKNjc3b07srZoT1uzMfnkB5s5YMFIuLfYqI9Zp5BS-rIfgXTOWyYcDjF8lEUQf4PAbqk2Xh0FdasKVjg/w400-h365/800px-Bas%C3%ADlica_de_Santa_Mar%C3%ADa_Elche.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Basílica de Santa María in Elche</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 16px;">As I read on the Unesco Heritage Website," the mystery play of Elche - which is entirely sung - is a sacred musical drama of the death, the passage into heaven (known as the Assumption) and the crowning of the Virgin Mary. The crowning moment is when an angel (a child from the village) is lowered down from the dome on a rope. We have seen the play twice and it is unique.</span></div><div><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 16px;"><br></br></span></div><div><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 16px;">We then had cocktails at the bar opposite the church. I went for mango mojito, Sandra for a gin tonic and Adele a glass of Rueda white wine. My friends loved Elche and kept telling me how friendly everyone is in Spain. I think they are right.</span></div><div><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 16px;"><br></br></span></div><div><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 16px;">From the main square we retrieved our car to drive to La Finca where were having dinner. This is top notch fine dining. La Finca, run by the chef Susana Diaz, has one Michelin star and the eating experience is fabulous. The only thing I missed was having dinner in their wonderful garden but it was closed and we ate inside in very modern installations. The whole eating experience was heaven for our taste buds and other senses. </span></div><div><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 16px;"><br></br></span></div><div><span style="background-color: white; font-size: 16px;">We drove home after a wonderful day together.

Suzy made our lunch again and shortly afterwards Sandra and I drove Adele to the airport. </div><div><br></br></div><div>We came back to a quieter apartment and got out the ludo board and then played cards until it was time for a small dinner. Before going to bed we watched a programme on the BBC summarising the first 7 days of war in Israel. It is very frightening. <br></br><div><br></br></div><div>And today is Sunday. Shortly I will be driving Sandra to the airport and then will carry on to Madrid which should take me 5 hours or so. I am hoping I won't get too much traffic and will let you know how I got on next Sunday.
