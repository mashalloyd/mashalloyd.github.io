Letting him go was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do and there is barely a day that goes past when he is not in my thoughts.  It was made sadder when I heard that my  dear Aunty Valya left us on Thursday. Her death signifies for me  the end of an era and the last of the Lievens. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps this first anniversary without my father  which is possibly the hardest, has been made a bit easier because we were not at home on the anniversary of his passing,  surrounded by all the things that make me remember him. He lived with us for the last 16 years of my life and the house is full of memories of life with him. He left a huge gaping hole. I knew he had to go one day; I just never wanted it to happen. All of you who read this blog, know what he meant to me so I won't go on and bore you with my memories. I do know that I made him proud with the wonderful send off I prepared for him in England last May. And this week coming I shall be visiting his, and my, beloved Yorkshire where he now rests in peace with my dear mother, Elena Von Lieven. The highlight of that trip will be to visit their grave and see for the first time the new headstone. But more about that next week.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Last Sunday was our first full day at our apartment in Gran Alacant near Santa Pola in the province of Alicante. We had  come to sort it out for the next season of guests. The most urgent job was getting the wicker settee and armchairs upholstered. I am glad to announce that the mission was accomplished. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">We woke up to sunshine and spent the morning in Santa Pola. We parked at the port and walked into the town centre. I couldn't believe the weather and the amount of people enjoying their morning like us. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjIdRSng5AQ83to7m6s3uB0tceLRjpmSt8R4HCd6RXkJM-2QbYRyHPStredkdUWXW3nanlFqLqYLFe6qgeQ9WQjDo8aAOn1u2FD9QUXTIWU7drAMl5Er3P6-5xUowm-a_cnkJJ5ZwAvOzKVIjSTtOTvs3SOmPNLuF3-CsqgWsi2r3bsQJmAH_M/s4032/20221106_113605.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjIdRSng5AQ83to7m6s3uB0tceLRjpmSt8R4HCd6RXkJM-2QbYRyHPStredkdUWXW3nanlFqLqYLFe6qgeQ9WQjDo8aAOn1u2FD9QUXTIWU7drAMl5Er3P6-5xUowm-a_cnkJJ5ZwAvOzKVIjSTtOTvs3SOmPNLuF3-CsqgWsi2r3bsQJmAH_M/w400-h180/20221106_113605.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio and Pippa by the port in Santa Pola last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">We had coffee in the main square which is dominated by an old castle - there are so many of them in this area; a throwback to the times of the Moors and the Christians.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">We sat outside in the sun enjoying life. Coffee always helps, in my case. Eladio goes along with me for the tradition but always asks for a decaf. I had to have a photo to share with you and here it is.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiSlNf5zEM6TKB2Fix7KKB2c2VTPPjTV9Z1R_P60JeRKTijZ64UW4PSjyehJ1GQWx_pahyxZ-LRDtvFq6MW0KN-RMCZ2eq_yOGn8g7XJH11SJkNd-qDROT4mqKwJ3iOAg0s8Jd0tdIZDGn1OrKeF3ZZvtkmaVs5_Xo4eeu-FZIv1TEjEcDUYIU/s4032/20221106_120113.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiSlNf5zEM6TKB2Fix7KKB2c2VTPPjTV9Z1R_P60JeRKTijZ64UW4PSjyehJ1GQWx_pahyxZ-LRDtvFq6MW0KN-RMCZ2eq_yOGn8g7XJH11SJkNd-qDROT4mqKwJ3iOAg0s8Jd0tdIZDGn1OrKeF3ZZvtkmaVs5_Xo4eeu-FZIv1TEjEcDUYIU/w400-h180/20221106_120113.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Coffee in Santa Pola last Sunday morning</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">We would have gone for a walk on the beach but Eladio couldn't find the car keys so we rushed back. Luckily he had left them inside the car.  I wished we had brought our swimming costumes as the day was magnificent. But no worries, we would bathe in the sea later in the week. </div><div style="text-align: justify;">We drove back home via the old coastal road and I was surprised at the amount of caravans; sorry, motor homes, all along the way. I supposed they were full of retired people from the north of Europe enjoying winter in Spain. Later that night I saw a clip on the TV about this same subject. Unusually, for this time of year the campsite in Benidorm is fully booked. 90% of its occupants are from the UK and apparently they are here because of the weather but also because they don't want to or cannot pay the heating costs necessary at this time of year in England. I was astounded.  This was not an isolated case. News of this kind has been abundant in Spain this week. They are calling it "energy tourism" where people from the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/tourism-industry-cost-of-living-crisis-spain-greece-b2199647.html">north of Europe flock to countries like Spain or Greece</a> to avoid heating bills in their countries. What have we come to? Companies are even relocating staff to places like the Canary Islands. Their staff are delighted to be working "while on holiday".  Local authorities here are cashing in on the idea and even promoting it in advertising. I read somewhere that in recent years nearly half a million people from a staggering 98 countries have relocated to the Costa Blanca where our apartment is. It has a 200 kilometre long coast and wonderful weather compared to the north of Europe, but 98 different countries, wow! The Spanish government is even considering relaxing the post Brexit rule so that British tourists can stay longer than the stipulated 90 days here. Of course they do as the Brits are at the top of the table of foreign tourism. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiD_v5lW-bs0iz7PtPiMjr1lmH3XyRRx1T5IGZ7Uwy36reRRxb4JAUL-g2FKyZgoM0nZ8p0JT2EQENv0czdyGTjNgoQytxbwaSMp2iTpdpo11AyICPBtIzaZeqKuiQBA0AR3chRHA52l553eRDe9PL924lUVwIkr0PrSTEDT8I2WS27tJIaWoQ/s600/caravan.webp" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="266" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiD_v5lW-bs0iz7PtPiMjr1lmH3XyRRx1T5IGZ7Uwy36reRRxb4JAUL-g2FKyZgoM0nZ8p0JT2EQENv0czdyGTjNgoQytxbwaSMp2iTpdpo11AyICPBtIzaZeqKuiQBA0AR3chRHA52l553eRDe9PL924lUVwIkr0PrSTEDT8I2WS27tJIaWoQ/w400-h266/caravan.webp" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Camper van owners flocking to Spain to avoid increasingly high energy bills in their home countries. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We do not even have central heating in this apartment as it is not really necessary. For the colder evenings we just use a gas heater which warms up the apartment in minutes.  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">But back to Sunday morning. Lunch was not a Sunday roast, rather leftover meat loaf hahaha. Normally we would have gone out for a meal but we only did once this week  because I am on a diet. Plus we had lots of provisions in the fridge or did when we went shopping on Monday. </div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">I spent the afternoon lazily watching more of Season 4 of The Crown and went to bed with Helen Rappaport's excellent Four Sisters book about the late Tsar's 4 young daughters. When I got to the end of it I read the acknowledgements and was delighted to read that Rappaport, a former alumna of Leeds University, had used as part of her sources, the Leeds University Russian Archive, run by Richard Davies. Wow! I know Richard well. He was my mother's colleague when she taught at Leeds. He did her the greatest favour when he helped her publish her father's poetry. He keeps all my mother's family documents there too. Richard was at both my mother and my father's funerals bless him. He told me later that Rappaport was awarded an honorary doctorate in 2017 for her historical books. I am now reading another book by her; "Ekaterinburg, The last days of the Romanovs". We all know the ending but we don't know what they went through. She is a wonderful writer. My father would have loved her books; my mother too. </div><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Monday</b> was more productive. We went to the local shopping centre to the Ironmongers - a place Eladio loves and I don't, and food shopping to the ubiquitous Mercadona. We had coffee again but this time not in the sun. It was too hot at 26ºc!!! We were determined that with errands out of the way, we would bathe the next day. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">I came home to cook; lentils and vegetable soup. Later I made chicken casserole to have on Tuesday so as to be free in the morning to go to the beach. Spanish lunchtimes can be a bore as everything stops and they are the main meal of the day so you have to be prepared if you want a morning free of cooking </p><p style="text-align: justify;">The afternoon was productive too. I had a lovely long Skype call with Amanda and shortly afterwards the upholstery man arrived; a man called Alfonso. He came from a firm called "Tapecerías Real" which specialises in upholstery work and which I had found on the internet the same day.  We needed him to change the  seating of our wicker three piece suite. I changed the fabric about 2 years ago and it was now faded but I had never changed the filling inside and the settee was very uncomfortable. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjWcfeiD_TZBnnzqV1htp4GWcurNQd3IYgZIoqtjuo0i94t73_c6bTa2hwllr-dpRsbBf4GnT8VHn-Vlg1tkoVbZPl30LN-JimHuuwRoltjtrNKFmaFrZ3LvhAzHxYh4rRobJ8_We6Qj3vXpdqhRzL3o_u_iJNCi5kVVZ5gB913xZonO9i-5eA/s4032/20200622_205606.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjWcfeiD_TZBnnzqV1htp4GWcurNQd3IYgZIoqtjuo0i94t73_c6bTa2hwllr-dpRsbBf4GnT8VHn-Vlg1tkoVbZPl30LN-JimHuuwRoltjtrNKFmaFrZ3LvhAzHxYh4rRobJ8_We6Qj3vXpdqhRzL3o_u_iJNCi5kVVZ5gB913xZonO9i-5eA/w400-h195/20200622_205606.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The three piece suite which needed upholstering</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;">We agreed on the work needed doing, the material, the cushions to match and the price which is much more reasonable than buying a brand new three piece suite. I couldn't believe it would be ready by this Friday. Thus we stayed on until the work was done. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">The day was a good day but a bit sad when I heard that night that my very old Aunt, Tyotya Valya, in France, my mother's sister-in-law, was really not well at all. I prayed for her. </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Tuesday</b> came and my day was full of thoughts of my dear father who had died one year ago that day. Oh what a day that was. Full of emotion, sadness but oh so much love. I shall never forget shortly before he died sitting with him and holding his hand and saying "I love you". His reply was "the same", which filled my heart with joy. These were the last words he ever uttered and they remain with me. So Tuesday  should have been a sad day and it was and it wasn't. He always taught me "you have to carry on". Of course, I have carried on. He did so despite every blow he ever got and his blows were more than most people get in a lifetime. So, I like to think of the good days, the days he enjoyed, such as the day the people from Cambridge University, from his college, Selwyn College, came out  to Madrid in a  mark of respect for his 100th birthday. He was pleased as punch and I made him wear his college tie for the occasion. This is the photo of that day. Another day I shall always treasure was when he led me up the aisle on my wedding day in 1983, ever the proud father. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcPb4VuTkU7Ie2JbTqm7YSVgai1NF1I9qERTKXPJXxzLYQ437AVvWmQmKnQAxP5_IWHr89QGkI-5TsE2v-l0rh6GFfH8q3Jkl70Inn6Ij-jRJgEkrFUUIHV_xPSPgqcPZHYtUWu4Vhmdnirr6yqXlpmXoLNFWJnAKRlgDAp673q6tBrwn_Oi4/s1066/IMG-20190501-WA0013.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcPb4VuTkU7Ie2JbTqm7YSVgai1NF1I9qERTKXPJXxzLYQ437AVvWmQmKnQAxP5_IWHr89QGkI-5TsE2v-l0rh6GFfH8q3Jkl70Inn6Ij-jRJgEkrFUUIHV_xPSPgqcPZHYtUWu4Vhmdnirr6yqXlpmXoLNFWJnAKRlgDAp673q6tBrwn_Oi4/w400-h400/IMG-20190501-WA0013.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My dear father on the eve of his 100th birthday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">A wonderful memory for me  too was on the day he turned 100 when I gave him my book. It was to be the biggest surprise of the day along with the birthday card from the King of Norway as well as The Queen's card. I think I was bursting with joy that day and I truly think the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/BIOGRAPHY-C-COURTENAY-LLOYD/dp/1916467997">book I wrote about his life</a> is my greatest achievement after giving birth.

So, no doubt, he would  have loved to join us on the beach that day. When we used to bring him here, he loved it too. </div><p style="text-align: justify;">Tuesday, the day of the anniversary of his passing,  was the day we spent the morning on the beach. We had a leisurely breakfast - I have slept so well here - and waited for the sun to be strong enough to drive down to Arenales. We had no problem parking at this time of year but were not alone. About 10 years ago, this place would have been deserted in November. Not so anymore, since many people now live around here permanently. We walked down the wooden walkway past the dunes to the spot we always return to on "our beach". </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuspcRWhuknbLstAsnp57wRWyrmI8-XY9ZRAUWWwiaxo05wePdn-OFJJb0cUsPKIQ-JgpeGvUPfImdK5__D-rRs1uORp9-G85UtcsZ1MM7ikbvIbVDcl1VlLNDv6D7mQ-GAr4shy2f7Bf2HHUb74eSn9jdy8IHquJJjiFG98YAU1gfA7TEn7g/s4032/20221108_105846.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuspcRWhuknbLstAsnp57wRWyrmI8-XY9ZRAUWWwiaxo05wePdn-OFJJb0cUsPKIQ-JgpeGvUPfImdK5__D-rRs1uORp9-G85UtcsZ1MM7ikbvIbVDcl1VlLNDv6D7mQ-GAr4shy2f7Bf2HHUb74eSn9jdy8IHquJJjiFG98YAU1gfA7TEn7g/w180-h400/20221108_105846.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Walking down to the beach</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Pippa came too even though dogs are not allowed. People don't really care though out of season and I saw plenty of other dogs too.  We took our very old chairs and were soon in our usual spot on the beach. We were not alone although few were actually bathing in the sea. We didn't think it was warm enough either so went on our walk to the end of the beach where it becomes rocky and people fish. From there you can see our apartments. I love sitting on one of the rocks there. We enjoyed our walk in the sunshine and soon felt warm.</div></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgqKS_l7Ty9p3JBZgvYuNmCQhilP5WocaAU4gqaDJpylTwZCVoU07R_7QkUGooFhjVxKkix_qMIKp3SF0v1qcExEXAVhnTtqzl0jeVRb93wX6uTvVnkCO51mUWzOA6zaYcGELDd5MuTCClXO0uNuqnOresVzcQBfFhfwUz1Znx8iHQjhSGwVk0/s4032/20221108_113356.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgqKS_l7Ty9p3JBZgvYuNmCQhilP5WocaAU4gqaDJpylTwZCVoU07R_7QkUGooFhjVxKkix_qMIKp3SF0v1qcExEXAVhnTtqzl0jeVRb93wX6uTvVnkCO51mUWzOA6zaYcGELDd5MuTCClXO0uNuqnOresVzcQBfFhfwUz1Znx8iHQjhSGwVk0/w180-h400/20221108_113356.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio and Pippa on our walk on the beach on Tuesday morning</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">It's about 20 minutes from our spot to the rocky part and once there, as always, we sat on the rocks enjoying the moment.

I never have in Santa Pola. The sad thing is it's due to climate change. This year has been the hottest ever and it seems we are having a nearly eternal summer. But I didn't want to think about that although at the back of my mind was the fact that this year's UN Climate Change  Conference was taking place just as I was bathing in the sea. The head of the UN, Antonio Guterres said in the inaugural speech, "We are on a highway to climate hell". He is right. I am happy Rishi Sunak finally went - possibly persuaded because Boris Johnson was going, but not happy that the new King Charles didn't. He wasn't allowed, yet he is the best Ambassador the UK could possibly have on the subject. While we all thought he was batty, he has been going on about it for decades but no one listened. We are listening now when it is nearly too late. </div><div style="text-align: justify;">While Eladio went in twice, I wondered if he had the same thoughts.

I couldn't believe when I woke up at 6 pm that I had slept for 2.5 h. I had missed my 5.30 Skype call with Adele (in Brittany) and Sandra (in Brussels) and the first messages I saw on my phone were "where is Masha?" I soon joined them and we had a good old natter for at least 2 hours! The whole afternoon had gone by with my sleeping and my Skype call. When I had finished it was time for dinner and, yes, I was hungry again. I made my standard tuna salad followed by fruit and then the news. That night we watched an intriguing Danish film on Netflix called "<i>Loving Adults</i>". There was not much about love in it though. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Wednesday</b> dawned and I had slept my fill.

I was intrigued. Whatever is a snuddie I thought? Basically it is a thick and warm type "hoodie" or even blanket that covers nearly the whole body. I have seen it described as a "cosy blanket hoodie". Oh gosh, I wondered, maybe I could wear one at home if my husband threatens to keep the indoor temperature at 19ºc, as recommended by the government. I did a quick search and saw that snuddies are in. I even saw them on sale for 15 euros at the local market on Thursday but wasn't, as yet, tempted.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpum7kFBTREyE0f-G9LTOMUts6nBHOlG2LEktgkb5lrRzJghr-KBvspJpPQ1GpewUZ6z7o7m4-we1IK-RQpaX-lfJWpKDLiQ-902s0fPNA2adt-aBbUs9_jy-Bx1MzLKpFXU6FgLUG8vtJCIyqAfwgiEPw36-eSnK1xCTclxsSD59eNZIyrsQ/s921/snuddie.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpum7kFBTREyE0f-G9LTOMUts6nBHOlG2LEktgkb5lrRzJghr-KBvspJpPQ1GpewUZ6z7o7m4-we1IK-RQpaX-lfJWpKDLiQ-902s0fPNA2adt-aBbUs9_jy-Bx1MzLKpFXU6FgLUG8vtJCIyqAfwgiEPw36-eSnK1xCTclxsSD59eNZIyrsQ/w326-h400/snuddie.jpg" width="326"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Snuddies are in, in the UK this winter. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">I had no need for one at the beach this week. After bathing that morning, we sat for a while in the sun. I tried to read my book but got interrupted first by guests and then by Olivia who needed a contact in the telecoms sector which I was happy to give to her. After a second bathe it was time for our walk to the end of the beach where the rocks are and from where you can see our apartments. Pippa enjoyed that part of the morning as she hates water in any size or shape. </div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We left at around 1.30 after a wonderful morning enjoying the sun and the sea in November and came home to shower and have lunch. That day it was leftovers - aren't they useful? Then it was time to watch the news. The main item was the ongoing results of the US midterm elections.  A Republican red wave was predicted but it didn't happen, although they did better than the Democrats.  I can't begin to understand the American election system. However, history seems to repeat itself or it has since at least Obama. A President gets in, two years later he loses the midterm elections and for the last 2 years of his term he can no longer pass legislation. It seems barmy to me. Barmy, and scary, is the fact that Trump is rearing his ugly head and is trying to  make a comeback.  However though he hasn't done so well as all but one of his endorsed candidates lost. Who has done well is his new rival, Ron DeSantis, the Governor of Florida who Trump is now aiming all his attacks at. But the game is not over and as I write this morning, the Democrats now lead 50 to 49 in the Senate which could be a breather. As to the House it is very close but we don't have the final results yet. I have a feeling the red wave did not happen because some Republicans are disenchanted with Trump. Maybe too, lots of young people voted in favour of the Democrats because of the new anti abortion law. So there is still hope for America. The ageing Biden will be very relieved. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The other news of the day was that a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-63569908">man was arrested in York</a> while trying to throw eggs at the new King Charles and his Queen, Camilla. Gosh, I thought, that would make  great material for The Crown. I know York quite well but did not know that when Royalty visit they  enter through the Micklegate Bar, the traditional royal entrance into the city. You can read more in the link above from the BBC. I was particularly interested to read this part which I quote here: "<i>Charles continued shaking hands with dignitaries including the Lord Mayor as the eggs flew in his direction, pausing briefly to look at the cracked shells on the ground</i>". </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhomJgNPLUr1rZ5-YZBcP4YjO5Rdt76OREk6sTjYrO12yNw0ltOpYsPmOiRu3tCq7kFYoPK4Vp1jaLN0ucB_tPgobrChXE-Tj7BwAQCktTDAuYEyVMk1JF2qHzNr1wycwEDoevehtFi4rOk6WYl694IA0CdNdegzX9IB5g6V2yy7uUVh1QGa50/s896/King-Charles-Egg.webp" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="224" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhomJgNPLUr1rZ5-YZBcP4YjO5Rdt76OREk6sTjYrO12yNw0ltOpYsPmOiRu3tCq7kFYoPK4Vp1jaLN0ucB_tPgobrChXE-Tj7BwAQCktTDAuYEyVMk1JF2qHzNr1wycwEDoevehtFi4rOk6WYl694IA0CdNdegzX9IB5g6V2yy7uUVh1QGa50/w400-h224/King-Charles-Egg.webp" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Charles and Camila in York after the eggs were directed at them. this week </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The protester aged 23,  was heard shouting "<i>this country was built on the blood of slaves</i>". That seems a pretty ridiculous protest. I would have expected it to be about energy bills for example. Some in the crowd shouted back "God Save the King" and "shame on you". I do wonder what the new King thought while this was happening. Did anything similar ever occur during his mother's reign I wondered. Probably not. In any case he came out unscathed as the eggs did not directly hit him or the Queen Consort. If I had been King Charles I would have asked to go to Betty's afterwards for tea and cake to get over the episode. There are plenty of fabulous egg dishes on their menu such as   Eggs Florentine or Eggs Benedict.  There is even one called "Eggs Royale with salmon"! As to the protester well he has been banned from ever carrying eggs in public again which was later changed to allow him to buy them for personal consumption at the supermarket!! Did you read that?</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Coincidentally, Wednesday  was the day of the premiere on Netflix of Season 5 of The Crown and of course, I, like many other fans of the series, was eager to watch it. So I began it that afternoon in peace. The "peace" bit is important when watching The Crown so as to savour every word of the wonderful dialogue. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I duly binge watched  Episodes 1 and 2 in one go on Wednesday afternoon. Oh, how short the episodes are. My main conclusion from watching The Crown is the importance of the media to the monarchy. It features in nearly every episode and I can relate to that as a former Communications Director. I once had a Swedish boss who told me no one reads the newspapers in Spain so basically my job wasn't that important. How wrong he was. No, not everyone reads the papers but word gets round. The first episode of The Crown was a fictional story about The Sunday Times reporting on a poll where half the nation was in favour of The Queen abdicating in favour of Prince Charles.  As to the story, I think they could have started with a more relevant one. John Major plays the PM and he is magnificent and even looks like him. Episode 2 is about Prince Philip, his new love of horse carriage riding and budding friendship with a younger woman, Penny Knatchbull. I think the hint here is that the friendship may well have been romantic which I think is highly unlikely. Then there is the ongoing story of the troubles between Charles and Diana which was to be expected. The story has been told so often, even I find it a bit boring. I have to say getting used to the new actors playing the senior royals was a bit distracting. As to the Queen, I am still getting used to the new face. Imelda Staunton aged 66 plays HM who is 65 when   the season starts but looks far, far older. Whereas her younger sister, Princess Margaret, looks too young. Wrong, wrong, wrong though is the actress who plays the Queen Mother. She is very thin so, sorry, you got the wrong actress to play this most senior royal. If you haven't seen the new season, here is a photo of the cast of the main characters so you can judge for yourselves.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxwPw8cPkTEFxKZIJhukO4uDdpG0ZoMhMxDWuoxzmxr-CKCie7-dYX1Z-QGgG12vcMELFg-xzhsSnEj6K1E36mu9NZrTXPCEnFT3w1moL27j0niQjgh7oxIISHEDJQo6-6WH8FVToztous2eGuG1lLqGe8pN0OPHwmN7WA4MlZ02XaTWReIIw/s980/TheCrownS05Unit-036NEW-9b81422.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="268" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhxwPw8cPkTEFxKZIJhukO4uDdpG0ZoMhMxDWuoxzmxr-CKCie7-dYX1Z-QGgG12vcMELFg-xzhsSnEj6K1E36mu9NZrTXPCEnFT3w1moL27j0niQjgh7oxIISHEDJQo6-6WH8FVToztous2eGuG1lLqGe8pN0OPHwmN7WA4MlZ02XaTWReIIw/w400-h268/TheCrownS05Unit-036NEW-9b81422.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The new cast of the senior royals in Season 5 of The Crown</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Despite this I still enjoyed my binge watching session. The next day I watched another two episodes and have to say that Episode 3 about the origins and rise of Mohammed Al Fayed was the best episode so far. It tells the story of how he buys The Ritz in Paris and then the Duke of Windsor's residence in Paris too. Not only that but he takes on the Duke's black valet, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/11/the-crown-duke-of-windsor-valet-sydney-real-life">Sydney Johnson</a>. </div></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOibnEHSMZPQcf3IYCGcwlMRZk4OcDjPRCyglJXxzABAKyjibiuJcg6i4Ut-yZM1KC7bicq9iMR1BTq2yD9NSRq89iqzEifBrI5a0CMhkwrcycwgGz2ZjW0Jfu1OBLM90FuNH_-lpDslriCJ4dLEmnG2NdUQHFyMWlsKByHYm1V5PAsZslCZA/s640/477361e73a3804766ad4187c185a91db.jpeg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="283" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgOibnEHSMZPQcf3IYCGcwlMRZk4OcDjPRCyglJXxzABAKyjibiuJcg6i4Ut-yZM1KC7bicq9iMR1BTq2yD9NSRq89iqzEifBrI5a0CMhkwrcycwgGz2ZjW0Jfu1OBLM90FuNH_-lpDslriCJ4dLEmnG2NdUQHFyMWlsKByHYm1V5PAsZslCZA/w400-h283/477361e73a3804766ad4187c185a91db.jpeg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The real Mohamed Al Fayed with the real royal valet Sydney Johnson</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This part of the story is true.

I rationed myself to new episodes so as not to watch it all too quickly. It is funny to think that a season takes 2 years to make yet less than 10 hours to watch. Later I really enjoyed episode 5 about the assassination of Tsar Nicholas and his family and the relationship with the British Royal family. In it, the Queen learns that her grandmother, Queen Mary, was the one who stopped King George V sending a ship to save them. I have never heard that version which is not correct. The Queen though makes amends the best she can by asking the new Russian PM Yeltsin, keen to have her visit Russia, to find their bodies and give the Romanovs the funeral they deserve. That did happen and even Prince Philip's blood was used for the DNA to see if the bodies matched his. After all the Tsarina was his Great Aunt. It did by over 98%. <br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">On Thursday morning we could have gone down to the beach again as it was another wonderful sunny day. But I didn't want to miss the weekly market day in Gran Alacant, practically across the road from our apartment. Whenever we are here on a Thursday we always go. It is a tradition I would never want to break. Oh, I do love markets. We went mainly to get fresh fruit and vegetables but I did get a bit of a look at the clothes and that's when I spied some "snuddies". I would have bought one if the colours hadn't been so bright or included silly wording on them. Maybe,  I shall visit Primark when I get home.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We concentrated on the fruit and veg which we both thought was more expensive than usual.

One was cut in half so I asked if I could have a taste. It tasted sweet enough, maybe a bit like a papaya but not quite so soft. I was told it is called "pitaya" but later learned it is more commonly known as dragon fruit. I bought one as I  thought it might be an acquired taste. We ate it for desert one night but found it rather tasteless. </div><div style="text-align: justify;">We took our heavy bags of fruit and veg home and then went out again. We went on an errand to order a new stove cover, someone had broken (a guest I suppose), then for a wonderful coffee together. Our last errand was some quick extra shopping at Mercadona. I do hate that supermarket where the whole of Spain shops but it does stock some good essentials.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">I came home to do a marathon of cooking with some of the veg I had bought. That was a lot of peeling and chopping hahaha but I was aided by my dear husband. You have probably noticed that I always cook from scratch. I made a vegetable soup with lots of pumpkin and then a chickpea concoction to be eaten the next day. I commented at lunch how lucky we are to be able to afford and eat as much fruit and veg as we want and of all kinds; not just apples and pears or carrots and potatoes, but even dragon fruit.  I imagine there are  households for whom they are nearly a luxury as prices have risen so high. This week I read that even some nurses in the UK have to resort to food banks! Really?  I also read they are going on strike for the first time in history. Oh dear, that is sad. </div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">But much sadder was the news I got that night all the way from New Zealand. My cousin Katty called me to tell me my Aunty (<span style="background-color: white; color: #202124;">тётя</span> (Tyotya) in Russian) Valya, had died aged 97 at her care home in France. I was expecting the call but it still shocked and saddened me.  Aunty Valya was the wife of my mother's youngest and most beloved brother, Nicolai, known as "Kolya" in the family. She was the last of the Lievens and the end of an era. All the brothers and sisters had died and now all their spouses, although only 4 married as 2 were nuns. They were </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Alexander </b>(1912-1987) married to Elena (Lena) Butkevich (1921-2011)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Olga</b> (Mother Superior Serafina) (1913-2004)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Dorothea</b> (Daria and Sister Catherine Lieven) (1917-1997)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>My mother Elena </b> (1920-1999) married to my father Charles Courtenay Lloyd (1919-2021)</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nicolai</b> (Kolya) (1924-1997 married to Valentina (Valya) Nikiichna Sakhagne (1925-2022)  </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Maria</b> (my Aunty Masha) (1927-2008) married to and divorced from Boris Manov and Denton B. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Valentina, Valya, known as "Koka" to her grandchildren and great grandchildren and Tyotya Valaya to me,  died on 10th November 2022, one year and 2 days after the last but one Lieven spouse, my dear father, died. Aunty Valya who emigrated with her family to France years before the war and after the Russian Revolution lived through the Nazi occupation in Paris. She had always been in my life, even before I was born and I loved her dearly. I am so glad I got much closer to her in the last few years when our famous cousinades were celebrated in the French countryside where she lived happily with her daughter, my cousin, Zuka. I loved getting to know her better in her golden years, smoking and drinking wine with her on the beautiful terrace in La Teillée and talking about the past and the family. That was always our main topic of conversation. Often I would cry and then laugh and she looked on benevolently. Like all the family, to distinguish me from my mother's sister Masha, she called me "baby Masha" which I loved. She spoke perfect French and Russian and very good English so we always spoke in English although I did like trying out my French on her. She spoke such clear, slow  and beautiful French it was a pleasure to listen to her. I shall treasure the memories of those occasions as I treasure that I got to say goodbye to her properly this last summer in July when Eladio and I visited her. The visit was poignant but sweet. We took her outside and sat in the shade in the strong heat and surrounded her with our love. This is a photo of that last time I saw her that I shall cherish. It was taken on 19th July 2022.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgR9l2c5T_JBjtRvROcoWoiTm-VsiLpZx3njHT8ZH4l05b4SiDnAd49mrvuFHLxjGNyiZAo4336CW9p1Ubm7fSeVJYdWttxSrkuSARHv1JJb0hBAncgEevPiOpOImxAkp3PjkaSsz7G6zjRpzxKlysMXo6qQsZXzJoDO1sBOKHqDAkwxhFanaE/s4032/last%20time.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgR9l2c5T_JBjtRvROcoWoiTm-VsiLpZx3njHT8ZH4l05b4SiDnAd49mrvuFHLxjGNyiZAo4336CW9p1Ubm7fSeVJYdWttxSrkuSARHv1JJb0hBAncgEevPiOpOImxAkp3PjkaSsz7G6zjRpzxKlysMXo6qQsZXzJoDO1sBOKHqDAkwxhFanaE/w400-h180/last%20time.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The last time I saw Tyotya Valya - France 19th July 2022. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">But the occasion was sad as I knew in my gut that this would be goodbye forever.

There she held court as the oldest member of the cousinade, smoking and drinking while watching us happily from a distance. She was always very photogenic even in her 90's. I should mention that as a young woman she was stunning. That she was able to smoke and drink until nearly the end speaks volumes against science and gives me hope too hahaha. </div></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvThl9p-3Wkq7xkiotSFifFtVJBr0uKfcMja8pJVHSVACAn6lQpdVR6WyTx3jKSOCsNIgC6W8A2Dr0i6K6d9dh9RmZD17-EsYCJnrXIcVD-8zaeWq2Bw834UPKxuofGDpBxjxRqgWVRkWTyDynhvZIoKhfKhScZdkJSP6d-y6a3vbBT1awLds/s4032/idr.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="195" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvThl9p-3Wkq7xkiotSFifFtVJBr0uKfcMja8pJVHSVACAn6lQpdVR6WyTx3jKSOCsNIgC6W8A2Dr0i6K6d9dh9RmZD17-EsYCJnrXIcVD-8zaeWq2Bw834UPKxuofGDpBxjxRqgWVRkWTyDynhvZIoKhfKhScZdkJSP6d-y6a3vbBT1awLds/w400-h195/idr.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Tyotya Valya, Île de Ré, summer of 2019. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">With her she takes the early memories of our families, the flight of the Lieven family from Russia and all that happened afterwards.

Now we shall cherish our memories of her as she too lives on in our hearts. As Suzy said when I told her, another star is looking down on us from above. Goodbye and RIP Tyotya Valya.

I wish I had brought my poppy but sadly I had left it at home. That didn't stop me remembering though and I was reminded this year, as every year, of the members of my own family who made their own contribution to peace in Europe in both WW1 and WW2. It was on this day at the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 that the Great War ended. I wonder how my grandfather, Revd Canon John Collins Lloyd, Chaplain and Captain of the Wiltshire Regiment, celebrated or where my great uncle, his brother-in-law, Harold Benson, was. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgv9Xzb5WyIaP_X_U-4naD9ZlMyikastWx-SFVJqKSz5TckeaegquKoHLI1jrAYqDrg4jrnY4cbyhQsvqNQIckhKsLcbe0WXn3V3tr8PSfB8bJBqRw07XbO9OhyHwGnDNP49J4reOgn0B_xqCA-aUgW6Y2Kc65hJpRNvR-uyFgldQgFl6Uxa90/s2586/Courtenay%20LLoyd&#x27;s%20parents&#x27;%20wedding%20January%201918%20his%20Father%20in%20WW!%20uniform.%20John%20Collins%20Lloyd%20and%20Dorothy%20Gertrude%20Scull.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgv9Xzb5WyIaP_X_U-4naD9ZlMyikastWx-SFVJqKSz5TckeaegquKoHLI1jrAYqDrg4jrnY4cbyhQsvqNQIckhKsLcbe0WXn3V3tr8PSfB8bJBqRw07XbO9OhyHwGnDNP49J4reOgn0B_xqCA-aUgW6Y2Kc65hJpRNvR-uyFgldQgFl6Uxa90/w225-h400/Courtenay%20LLoyd&#x27;s%20parents&#x27;%20wedding%20January%201918%20his%20Father%20in%20WW!%20uniform.%20John%20Collins%20Lloyd%20and%20Dorothy%20Gertrude%20Scull.jpg" width="225"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My grandfather with his captain and chaplain WW1 uniform on on the day of his wedding</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8Pt1wxueDiiYhV3X0RTDjcApYrWANP-kosegb9ZVTWiKBXELTbJJfHjUCmmiftq4VpDGkzdMX3m4fDI149pEuX-xJ6Ge9qpnhYGtEk8C1dBZweA1GUGgA8ledJBRnG2650_tINSMk0cfJGg5ZIAoSD8FeMYke1CmMSw5zv6VDaMCeub-5r9o/s1600/Harold%20Benson%20Angela&#x27;s%20father%20WW1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi8Pt1wxueDiiYhV3X0RTDjcApYrWANP-kosegb9ZVTWiKBXELTbJJfHjUCmmiftq4VpDGkzdMX3m4fDI149pEuX-xJ6Ge9qpnhYGtEk8C1dBZweA1GUGgA8ledJBRnG2650_tINSMk0cfJGg5ZIAoSD8FeMYke1CmMSw5zv6VDaMCeub-5r9o/w225-h400/Harold%20Benson%20Angela&#x27;s%20father%20WW1.jpg" width="225"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My great Uncle Harold Benson who would eventually die of war wounds. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">His daughter, Angela - Aunty Angela to me - is still alive and lives in a care home in Wales.

These are the appropriate words that will probably be said from pulpits: <i>"Today, as we should every day, we remember those who volunteered, sacrificed, served, fought and died, for our freedom. We thank you and we salute you as we salute those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. We will never forget"</i>. We will remember you. I shall, at least, until the end of my days. I salute you Daddy, Grandpa, Aunty Gloria and Uncle Harold. As an afterthought, may we too remember on Armistice Day, Ukraine's fight for freedom. We have some hope this week as Russian troops abandoned the fight in the key city of Kherson. I am glad that Putin's plan are not working out but it is horrible for the Ukrainians and the consequences for the rest of the world are inflation and recession. These are difficult times and although the Ukrainians are celebrating this latest victory, the war is far from over. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As if it was a sign of respect, the clouds appeared on Friday 11th November, even on the Levante Coast where there were huge floods in Valencia. . There would be no bathing that day. There was a huge storm all morning and the thunder and lightening frightened Pippa so much she spent the morning trembling. We didn't venture out all day and enjoyed a day of peace and quiet reading mostly. We were waiting for the upholsterer to come and bring the cushions and fillings for the wicker chairs and settee. Alfonso and his wife, Victoria, from Tapicería Real arrived at 6 on the dot. It took an hour for Alfonso to make the three piece suite look new and just how we wanted. What was difficult was figuring out what he said as he is from Jaen in Andalucía and has a very strong accent.  Within the hour the job was done and we were very pleased with it. We paid them in what is called "black money" here, i.e. cash, no invoice and nothing declared. That is the Spanish economy for you but it saves us paying VAT and the supplier paying tax. Very naughty I know but a common practice here. I was so delighted I gave his company a 5 star review on Google. He pronounced it "gog-lay" which I found hilarious. In any case they had done a great job and in just 4 days. Finally now we have comfortable seating in this little apartment. I just hope the guests don't stain the new upholstery although it is leak proof. I later sat on the settee watching The Crown feeling a lot more comfortable than before.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I had chosen a very bold colour; "<a href="https://www.kazoart.com/blog/en/six-colours-inherited-from-renowned-artists/">bleu majorelle</a>" (or as near to it as I could get). This is a blue colour I first saw in Marrakech years ago at the Yves Saint Laurent gardens. I later learned that it was the painter Jacques Majorelle who invented the colour (very similar to Yves Klein's blue but more purple). YSL bought the property in 1980 and think that is when this bold shade of blue became well known. When I saw the gardens there I   fell in love with the colour. The cushions, in contrast, are covered in a lovely blue and white flowery material which I think matches perfectly. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMdED-tk8-On1pIDZffO7aO7NW-G4I7dtaVz2iq7civqmx3BZiR7nheN7MsYm2VzizILCo8RHHKiILGEsxD3C2vY7rwCmXJ9zPG84TUl6yuWiO2GHDRRjrH-kg2ZvgRqr0ryuB_UuG3Fio3FGuTH1vjs4I_55-9cS4evAFAZMS4uTUAF66hOw/s4032/20221111_192037.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMdED-tk8-On1pIDZffO7aO7NW-G4I7dtaVz2iq7civqmx3BZiR7nheN7MsYm2VzizILCo8RHHKiILGEsxD3C2vY7rwCmXJ9zPG84TUl6yuWiO2GHDRRjrH-kg2ZvgRqr0ryuB_UuG3Fio3FGuTH1vjs4I_55-9cS4evAFAZMS4uTUAF66hOw/w400-h180/20221111_192037.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our three piece wicker suite given a new look this week and is so much better than before. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The colour  is very Mediterranean, maybe a bit bold but goes very well with the decor in the apartment.

Never mind, who cares here?</div></div></div></div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Saturday</b> dawned and the rain had gone. In its place the sun was shining although it was a little windy. Would we go down to the beach again and bathe one last time? We thought it wasn't quite warm enough and both agreed we fancied a morning and lunch in Alicante. Alicante, the capital of this province and quite a "posh" sort of seaside town always brings back memories of my first visit to Spain after my mother had bought a ramshackle house in Callosa - inland and about 65km from Alicante. It was 1972, 3 years before Franco died and I was just 15. Although tourism was beginning to boom it was nothing like today. I remember arriving at the train station and walking in the hot sun carrying  my heavy rucksack trying to make my way to the bus station with not a word of Spanish. How could I imagine that 50 years later I would be in that same town but in very different circumstances; married to a Spaniard and with my own apartment and not a ramshackle one? Never in my life. Once there we made a beeline for the famous Kiosko Peret ice cream parlour and bar on the beautiful Paseo de la  Explanada - a little like the Ramblas in Barcelona but parallel to the sea. It's very near the chic port. I think the first time I ever tried chocolate con churros was at Peret. So there we were again, going back to the scene of the crime so to say. We had a lovely coffee admiring our surroundings and commenting on what a lovely warm day it was for November. I'm not surprised it is so popular with tourists as it is the sunniest city in Europe with an average of 349 hours of sun per month. At Peret, we actually had to sit in the shade as it was too hot in the sun! </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: justify;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiLU1pkHOvQr_Y7l2PSP1IjDACdgksz_eMRvQu8QFMLBL6ttJGWy84LOYNfHbnEH5s9GSYTR4llpYdmRxzoabU3aBUw4WvnqeG1NlMNRGpajyfMo-Iro2iqxhHESdcor8QLuNSdTFSDt4HdPHEf23B2-_fh_BBipUI_AUidXj1Po9ey8qcG0Qw/s4032/20221112_122738.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiLU1pkHOvQr_Y7l2PSP1IjDACdgksz_eMRvQu8QFMLBL6ttJGWy84LOYNfHbnEH5s9GSYTR4llpYdmRxzoabU3aBUw4WvnqeG1NlMNRGpajyfMo-Iro2iqxhHESdcor8QLuNSdTFSDt4HdPHEf23B2-_fh_BBipUI_AUidXj1Po9ey8qcG0Qw/w400-h180/20221112_122738.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>At Kiosko Peret on the Explanada in Alicante yesterday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">After our coffee we couldn't resist a walk along the Explanada which runs parallel to the port and is lined with rows of palm trees.

I was very disappointed to find it was indoors with no windows and basically just off the lobby. I asked for "gambas al ajillo" (prawns in garlic) and was disappointed too that they came not shelled and once shelled that there were just 7 miserly prawns. I don't think we will be going back. It was our only lunch out and I didn't make the best choice. We loved visiting Alicante though, so no complaints. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We came home to rest - always resting you must think hahahaha. Well, we are retired hahaha. Come dinner I was hungry after my very low calorie lunch and gobbled up a dish of chickpea soup. The day ended with the news and more of The Crown.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Today my friends is Sunday, the day of our departure. All good things come to an end and it's time to go home. I look forward to seeing my guests, Shabnam again from Iran who has stayed on, Roger from Canada or Panama who is with us till the beginning of December and a new guest, Laroslav who arrived yesterday. It's uncanny to think he is from Ukraine. It will be very interesting to talk to him, that's for sure. Of course I mainly look forward to seeing my grandchildren, Elliot and Juliet who I haven't seen for more than a week. I wonder if Juliet is walking yet. Probably not as I would have heard. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">So that's it from me this week. All the best to you all and let's hope next week brings more cheerful news. To think that I will be writing next week's blog post from Yorkshire fills me with joy. I can't wait to be there even in November.  I am going to God's Own Country and couldn't be happier about it.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">Cheers for now, Masha</div><div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><p style="background: 0px 0px rgb(255, 255, 255); border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #002f6c; font-family: Arimo, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; text-align: justify; text-size-adjust: 100%; vertical-align: baseline;"><br></br></p><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><h2 class="news-full__standfirst" style="background-color: white; color: #666664; font-family: bernino-regular, Verdana, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: -0.2px; line-height: 24px; margin: 0px 0px 16px; max-width: 1128px; padding-top: 8px; text-align: justify;"><br></br></h2></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div></div></div>
