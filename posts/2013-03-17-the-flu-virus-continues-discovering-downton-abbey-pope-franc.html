<div class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Hello again everyone,</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Today is
Sunday and is day 13 of my flu virus which has had me out of action and feeling
unwell and strange for so long now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
don’t remember the last time I had flu but it must have been many years
ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I have waves of nausea and have
lost my appetite (good you may say), things taste and smell strange, I have
gone off coffee and can’t stand my new perfume Angel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I haven’t been for a walk for two weeks and
have little energy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I have spent a lot
of my time in bed sleeping and I have been plagued with ghastly headaches for
which no tablets have any affect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Luckily this is a peaceful time for me at work and I have no trips or
events on the horizon, so I have had to stick it out at home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>On Monday I thought I was better and got of
bed but it was an illusion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>On Tuesday I
had to go into work for the weekly management team meeting and then a fancy
lunch at <a href="http://norestaurant.es/index.html#centro">No </a>with the girls from my events agency and my new boss.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That was such a huge effort I think I have
paid for the consequences the rest of the week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>On Thursday Eladio dragged me to the local doctor when my head was at
its worst.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>There I heard my symptoms
were common and that there was an epidemic of this particularly strange and
cruel virus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He prescribed antibiotics in
which I had no faith as I have always understood that they cannot cure a
virus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But I was wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Finally yesterday, Saturday I began to feel
just slightly better and today I know I am on the mend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I still feel all those funny things but at
least the headaches have gone and I can begin to feel myself again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Today I think I shall go for our walk for the
first time in nearly two weeks and that will be the test.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I have friends who have also had this flu and
some have warned it takes a whole month to get over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I sincerely hope that in my case it will be
less.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">But let me start
from the beginning, from Monday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The
week before I had made an order for meringue nests and sugar free jelly from a
new online shop called <a href="http://www.britparcel.com/">Brit Parcel</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
love meringue nests to serve with fruit and yoghurt and ice cream and they are unattainable
in Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The big plus of meringue is
that each piece only contains 50 calories, so great for keeping the weight
down. So this was my chance and I ordered 25 packets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Even I was shocked when I saw my order arrive
on Monday morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I now have enough
meringue to last us more than a year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The
problem though is the expiry date is the end of May.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">This was the week
I discovered and fell in love with the British TV series <a href="http://www.tv.com/shows/downton-abbey/">Downton Abbey</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>My friend Julio had lent me the dvd of series
one some time ago but I never had a moment to watch it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So while I was in bed curing my flu, it was
finally the time to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had watched
parts of series three recently on the television but of course not having
watched the series from the beginning didn’t understand a lot of the
story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So from Wednesday to Friday I
polished off the whole of series one and have now ordered series two and three
from Amazon which hopefully will arrive tomorrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It’s a great British series, similar to
Upstairs Downstairs but oh the setting is much grander and the story line is
far better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Discovering
Downton Abbey has been the one advantage of having flu.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I can’t think of any other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Oh but yes I can, the pleasure of having my
wonderful husband Eladio looking after me so lovingly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thank you Eladio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You are the best personal doctor in the world.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Tuesday the
much awaited Conclave started to vote for a new Pope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>When I last wrote I told you I had hoped for
an African pope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was very interested
in the whole process as much of the world’s media were, so I was very cross
with myself, when, because of watching Downton Abbey, I missed the white smoke
on Wednesday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>To tell you the truth I
missed it because I thought the process would take much longer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I have followed the news very closely and am
fascinated with the whole story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It is
funny that in this increasingly secular world the media should have made such a
fuss of the conclave.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But they have and
I think the reason is the sheer fascination with the medieval rituals entailed being
played out in this modern age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had
hoped for a black Pope but am equally pleased a Latin American has been chosen,
someone from the “new world”, albeit of Italian origin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/the-pope/9928845/Argentinas-Jorge-Bergoglio-elected-as-new-Pope-Francis.html">Jorge María Bergoglio</a>, aged 76, the arch
bishop of Buenos Aires is the first Jesuit Pope and he calls himself Francis
after the humble lover of the poor, Saint Francis of Assis. He is a breath of
fresh air, modest and simple in his ways and in his first 48 hours or so has
broken with many of the trappings of his predecessors, shunning protocol, talking
directly and even going on incognito trips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">His first
words were very simple, Buona Sera and he started with a joke that his fellow
cardinals had to go to the end of the world to find a new pope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He refused to travel in the pope mobile
preferring the cardinals’ bus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He also
refused to wear the pope’s red shoes and ermine red cape remarking that “the
carnival is over”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In Buenos Aires he
apparently travels on public transport but that will probably be difficult in Rome.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>When he was shown the Papal rooms he
commented that there was room for 300 people and that he didn’t need all that
space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Later he held a press conference
for the 5000 media reporting on the conclave where he abandoned the script and
told them some of the secrets of the conclave as well as saying that he wanted
a poor church for the poor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Oh yes I
like this man, but don’t get me wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>He is modest and humble, smiles and jokes but he is not liberal and we
will not see him admitting women to the priesthood or recommending
contraception or even letting priests marry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>On the other hand he is a breath of fresh air in the stifling and
corrupt Vatican and I think he will attract more people to the dwindling faith
and will do the Catholic Church a lot of good.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Wednesday
just as the white smoke emerged from the chimney of the roof of St. Peter’s
Basilica in Rome, Olivia was arriving by plane in Lisbon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I told you last week that she was to be the
MC for a European Union prize giving ceremony.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It was for a teacher’s project called <a href="http://www.etwinning.net/en/pub/index.htm">eTwinning</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The event was on Thursday afternoon and for
the occasion she wore a lovely red dress of mine from Zara.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Isn’t it nice that we can wear each other’s
clothes?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Miguel, her boyfriend, had
flown out from Valencia on Thursday morning to be with her and they were to
make a long weekend of the occasion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So whilst
in bed watching Downton Abbey Miguel was sending e photos of Olivia in action,
on stage in Lisbon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She looks so
professional, don’t you think?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She later
admitted she found the whole subject of the prize giving rather boring and I
told her I hoped no one noticed. Thankfully they didn’t as they were very pleased
with her and have said they want to work with her again in next year’s
edition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She was also approached by a
man in the audience who said he wanted to hire her services for an event in
Istanbul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Fancy that!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She will be back tonight but just for a few
hours as tomorrow she will be up at 4 in the morning when a car comes for her
from TVE to take her to the airport where she will catch an early flight to
Santiago in Galicia from where she will be reporting this coming week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">This week was
a sad week for my best friend Fátima.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>On
Wednesday morning I heard through Julio that her 86 year old father had
died.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I rang her immediately and heard
that the lady who looked after him and whom I know, Manoli, had found him dead
in his bed in his flat in Santa Pola that very morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Fátima told me through tears that she had
spoken to him the night before and that apart from his flu he seemed perfectly
ok.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Later she told me he must have died
of sudden pneumonia, so this horrible flu virus finished him off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She went immediately to Santa Pola with her
brother Manuel and sister Gloria to do everything you have to do when someone
close to you dies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>On Friday morning
when I was doing the food shopping with Oufa I bumped into her and we went to
have a cup of coffee together and she was able to tell me of her ordeal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Her main feelings were of guilt for not
seeing him often enough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I told her he
wouldn’t want her to suffer from guilt, that guilt is so negative and that she
should remember the good times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>My heart
went out to her though of course and made me remember my own Mother’s
death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Nothing ever prepares a child for
the death of his parents. R.I.P. Manuel.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">This was the
week Samsung, the Korean mobile phone giant, chose to launch its new <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2013/mar/15/samsung-galaxy-s4-launch">Galaxy S4</a>
model and it did so in the homeland of it arch enemy Apple, in the US, in the
heart of New York at the Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I am a great fan of the S3 model and also a
user of the Apple iPhone 5 so was interested to see what was new in the
S4.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>And it turns out that not much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It’s all about software rather than
hardware.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had hoped for a less plastic
finish, but the S4 looks identical to the S3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It apparently
does new stuff that I find rather gratuitous like stops a video if you remove your
eyes from the screen and I have also read that many of the new features are
available already for other Android phones via applications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>What is an improvement though is the camera
which has 13 megapixels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But is it an iPhone
killer? <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Only the market can answer that
but I doubt it.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The weekend has
been quiet. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I am feeling better but not
really up to going out to the cinema or for dinner out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So the highlight this weekend was having Suzy
and her friend Juli for lunch yesterday. Oufa our Moroccan home help made fish
and chips but in a very unBritish way with spices in the breadcrumbs and
potatoes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Today, her day off, I am cooking
a traditional Spanish meal, oxtail with sauce made from the stock and
vegetables with sautéed potatoes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You
see, my appetite is coming back.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We didn’t go
out last night, Saturday but thoroughly enjoyed a great World War II film on
the TV in bed called “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Eagles_Dare">Where Eagles Dare</a>” by Alistair McClain and starring
Richard Burton and a very young Clint Eastwood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It had us riveted to the screen to well past one in the morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Hopefully next
weekend I will feel completely myself and we will be able to go and see the new
version of Anna Karenina and also have dinner out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>And now I have the reached the end of the
tale of this week and it is time to go upstairs and make the sauce for the
meat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So I will leave you and wish you
