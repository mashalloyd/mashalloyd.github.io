We have been away for 2 weeks, quite a record and it was a tonic for my mind and body and I am sleeping much better now. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">This was the week that several significant events took place. The news that shocked me was the ruling in the US that abortions are no longer a constitutional right for women. I was astounded. I mean what century is the world's most powerful country living in? Instead of banning abortions they should ban guns but that is not going to happen. I sincerely think I could never live in the US. It's not that I like abortions; no one does. It's just that they are a necessary evil. In some states any form of abortion is not allowed including pregnancy through rape or incest.  I mean, come on. Who are these outdated judges - all men - dictating women's reproductive health? Many other things happened on the world scene such as a terrible earthquake in Afghanistan as if that dreadful country didn't already have enough with the damned Taliban ruling its people. It didn't make headline news though as an earthquake in Afghanistan is not news. If it had happened in any western country it would be front page news. In Spain or rather in the enclave of Mellila, nearly 20 people died trying to cross the horrible wall from Morocco into Spain. That did make the news as it is nearer home. When are we going to do away with walls like the one in Israel or in the US to stop desperate people entering? Isn't there a more humane way of dealing with immigrants seeking a better life? It certainly isn't sending them to Rwanda where this week the Commonwealth meets. Prince Charles put a spoke in the oar of Boris Johnson when he said it was appalling. He only said what we all think. The other news is of course inflation which is going up and up and making living more costly than ever. We all blame Covid but of course the war in the Ukraine too.  I haven't written much about the latter recently as it's hard to keep up with. It looks to me as if it will be a very long and drawn out battle which will probably end in stale mate and a loss of territory for Ukraine. Next week NATO will hold its annual conference here in Madrid where no doubt the main topic will be the war and how to stop Russia. But there was good news for Ukraine this week as it has been admitted as an entry state into the EU along with Moldavia (or is it Moldova?). However it will take years for it to become a fully fledged member. Covid is still rampant with new variants springing up every day, Monkeypox has been declared a pandemic by the WHO so we should all watch out. It's ok for those of us who have had a smallpox vaccine but not for those who haven't which is probably most children. Then I read that polio is making a come back. I thought it had been eradicated. My father's brother Raymond died age 16 of polio, then called "infantile paralysis".  I came across an article describing how people, mostly children, eventually die from it and it made for chilling reading. I thought of poor Raymond and how much he must have suffered. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Thankfully our week was tame in comparison. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Last Sunday Eladio's brother and his wife were leaving El Cuetu and returning to the family village, Montrondo, after a wonderful week there with us. They were to be met half way by their son Miguel at the awful ex mining town called Pola de Lena. Coincidentally that is where Eladio got his first teaching placement after he passed the exams to become a state teacher. We had to go there for him to sign for the placement but luckily he got another one in Madrid. I could never ever have lived in that awful town. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">But they serve good coffee there and we had one in the main square while waiting for Miguel who arrived shortly afterwards with their dog, Nuba. It was time to say goodbye and go our separate ways. We would miss them and our lovely routine of exploring the area in the mornings and resting in the afternoons. I would miss them most in the evening when we would drown a bottle of local cider accompanied by pistachios. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Pola de Lena is 1.15h away from El Cuetu and we decided to stop for lunch at the picture postcard seaside town of Lastres to have lunch at  <a href="https://www.casaeutimio.com/">Eutimio</a>. We had lunch there years ago and always wanted to go back. Sunday last was the perfect day to do so. Lastres is a very popular destination and parking is a challenge. In the end Eladio had to go down to the port and of course leave Pippa in the car while we had lunch. Fortunately it wasn't hot at all that day. The heat wave was over and there would be no more beach days.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMXmRzJBOqApHOffKkHiCWljJY1HadKauRcw9y4n0c9ZFHtwggquXeX0-tfA21p41cgqLnf1UZPQ1B--XXJPH4QBfXg-GjLme8xfcMeeGp7rKRdtoHb82ZzXSZuU1Yt774bk5vvjxzlm52zSR1sctgTQOYi3uxOSc2q2vZWrO7gyxS17AL1j4/s4032/20220619_132958.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgMXmRzJBOqApHOffKkHiCWljJY1HadKauRcw9y4n0c9ZFHtwggquXeX0-tfA21p41cgqLnf1UZPQ1B--XXJPH4QBfXg-GjLme8xfcMeeGp7rKRdtoHb82ZzXSZuU1Yt774bk5vvjxzlm52zSR1sctgTQOYi3uxOSc2q2vZWrO7gyxS17AL1j4/w180-h400/20220619_132958.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Outside the restaurant, Eutimio in Lastres last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Lunch there was spectacular as were the views from the restaurant overlooking the sea.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzxGS37njNc3j2ORxfWJmYWRTUx1tc0LkFaFLR7Ow9A3IlClO3EYahwt0H1XCFisJJPWqx4iOHwoet5dDMKhO_anLtRxXLZvVnp0zA1zeSwcrLHWDz6Fgjpz32gptZk9ttp8Qj3o_A1-PtYUyBWKMhqUotmZAn3IjbeW-489xm9pA0gO0eK_I/s4032/20220619_134050.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzxGS37njNc3j2ORxfWJmYWRTUx1tc0LkFaFLR7Ow9A3IlClO3EYahwt0H1XCFisJJPWqx4iOHwoet5dDMKhO_anLtRxXLZvVnp0zA1zeSwcrLHWDz6Fgjpz32gptZk9ttp8Qj3o_A1-PtYUyBWKMhqUotmZAn3IjbeW-489xm9pA0gO0eK_I/w400-h180/20220619_134050.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>One of the view from the restaurant</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">I was delighted to see there was lobster salad on the menu.

I sat outside reading my book until it turned a little cold and I had to go in. I fell asleep watching Borgen and had to be woken up by Eladio at 8.30 at night!!! No doubt I had caught up on some much needed sleep. As we had only had one course for lunch, we were hungry for dinner. I got out some ham and a not particularly sweet melon and we had a Spanish dish called "melon con jamón".</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">For the first time since we were there, we watched the news. Eladio was keen to know the results of the regional elections in the southern part of Spain known as Andalusia. We were both surprised to see that the PP (Partido Popular), the right wing opposition party, had won with an overall majority. Thus no pact would be needed with the far right party Vox. I suppose that was good news for some. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Monday</b> came and we had an important task on our hands.  We had found a leak from the upstairs bathroom the day before when we saw water on the floor downstairs. There is always something to be repaired at one of our houses. That meant finding a plumber and possibly changing the bath and turning it into a shower unit. We didn't have much time as our first guests are arriving on 2nd July. The task was not easy. We spent most of the morning ringing around and not getting far. Plumbers are few and far between in rural Asturias. It was on our way to Posada when we stopped at the local shop in Puente Nueve where we found one out of sheer providence. The story is like a miracle. We asked the shopkeeper, Vicente, if he knew of a plumber. He stared at us and asked if were joking and pointed at a man by the bar who was having a drink. Vicente said; "he is a plumber". It was when we heard that the plumber's name was "Jesus" (quite common in Spanish) that we realised we had just witnessed a miracle or was it a coincidence? I will never know.  Jesus agreed to visit our house in the afternoon and would be back the next day with a solution to the leak in the upstairs bathroom. Feeling relieved but amused we thanked both Vicente and Jesus and went on our way. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">At Alimerka, the local supermarket, we stocked up on cleaning products to last the summer of guests and then drove to a restaurant called "El Sucón", on a very obscure and tiny road but tree lined and full of foliage. We had booked a table for lunch after having heard good references. The menu of the day was just 10 euros which is peanuts don't you think?</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhq-S1oiHIShLSmsXgO2zoGLfMEpEXyLURs8lvtDarVhi6nqavqyeP94d2iuPIvdeOrgwFpNRTHBldgOlPQXm4pq3adj66WuuHc62VCKDO-szpOu3oDn8ma2zEFeh56AOYYY9pP9aNyXeExWF7UHB3houLgEalbDfJ-LjOJSR7xxdfcScu2wDw/s4032/20220620_134738.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhq-S1oiHIShLSmsXgO2zoGLfMEpEXyLURs8lvtDarVhi6nqavqyeP94d2iuPIvdeOrgwFpNRTHBldgOlPQXm4pq3adj66WuuHc62VCKDO-szpOu3oDn8ma2zEFeh56AOYYY9pP9aNyXeExWF7UHB3houLgEalbDfJ-LjOJSR7xxdfcScu2wDw/w400-h180/20220620_134738.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>El Sucón where we had lunch on Tuesday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">We went dressed in the warmest clothes we had brought as the temperatures plummeted during our final days in Asturias to around 18ºc which for me is cold. That meant no more sitting out on our terrace and reading in the sun or going to the beach. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We did actually sit on the terrace at El Sucón but it was covered. The food was plain but plentiful. I went for the fabada and Eladio for the chickpea stew and a fish dish. We took home a doggy bag with enough food for lunch at home on Wednesday. In Asturias and in Galicia the portions are always enormous as they were at El Sucón. I have to add both stews were superb. We had our dessert at home as we had plenty of fruit to consume before we left.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The afternoon was spent quietly until Jesus the plumber arrived at around 7.15. He confirmed the leak and the deteriorating drain which was full of rust. There were 3 options: fix the leak but leave the rust, change the bath for a new bath tub or a shower unit. We went for option 2 - changing the tub and Jesus would come back the next day to take measurements, etc and give us an estimate. That meant we couldn't leave Asturias until Wednesday. We had originally planned to return on Monday but it was not to be. Olivia needed us badly to help with the grandchildren and we were keen to oblige. So, all good things do come to an end I am afraid.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I was up at 6.30 am on <b>Tuesday</b> morning. The sun came out again for a while but the day was mostly cloudy. We waited for the plumber to send his estimate all day but it never came. Since José Antonio and Dolores left, apart from visiting Lastres we did not explore any more of the area but focused on getting the house ready for our guests in July and August. We did go out though that morning to Posada for a coffee and for Eladio to get something from the ironmongers - oh how he loves ironmonger shops, bless him. It was while we were in Posada that I happened upon an Adamo commercial van. Adamo is the fiber internet company - a specialist in rural Spain - that I worked for for 5 years before retiring. They have the best fast broadband in rural Spain and I had no idea that they were now deploying their network in Asturias. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgrxMiSOEOweWGk7wcFLSM4OkBmopz8kSX41rzvWAne_z3fL6x5qFqlxFquqMgcRpcgeE6t6LaGgCo4801TcL0sYo6VS2yLLGD64olzUCt56-FLyO947wMvk0qJScNiCMp207DPEmba8OOKmCoa25fEmNT9Yz8LtToU_LuzbP-5TExFCgTR9J8/s4032/Lorry.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgrxMiSOEOweWGk7wcFLSM4OkBmopz8kSX41rzvWAne_z3fL6x5qFqlxFquqMgcRpcgeE6t6LaGgCo4801TcL0sYo6VS2yLLGD64olzUCt56-FLyO947wMvk0qJScNiCMp207DPEmba8OOKmCoa25fEmNT9Yz8LtToU_LuzbP-5TExFCgTR9J8/w400-h180/Lorry.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Adamo van in Posada de Llanes on Tuesday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">I had to go up and greet the salesmen but I never thought they would be installing their infrastructure in our village, El Cuetu, where the population is tiny. I was delighted to hear it was in their plans, so there and then I signed up as a customer. Finally I was to become an Adamo customer. I use Telefonica at the house in El Cuetu with a 4G router but soon I shall have fast fiber internet which will be wonderful for us and for our guests. It was a great coincidence. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We had to have a picture to commemorate the event which had me pleased as punch. I was always grateful that Adamo took me on as their freelance Communications Director when I was laid off by Yoigo just before my 60th birthday.

It was a Google Home Mini speaker a bit like the Amazon Alexa or pretty much the same. So the first thing I did when I got home was to set it up. It works like magic with my Samsung Galaxy phone but stubbornly refuses to connect with my iPad.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I nearly forgot to add that Tuesday 21st June was the summer solstice, the longest day in the year. However, we didn't notice it at all in Asturias where the sky was cloudy and dark and it rained. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The rest of our last day in Asturias was quiet. We were up early on <b>Wednesday</b>, the day of our departure. It didn't take long to get ready and we left at around 10.30 am. We stopped 3 times, for coffee, lunch in Alar del Rey and for petrol. Would you believe diesel petrol was selling for 2.21 euros a liter!!!! It used to cost around 70 to 80 euros to fill the tank of our old Volvo. That day, before the government pitiful discount, it came to nearly 120 euros. Some say it will go up to 3 euros a liter at some point. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We arrived around 5.30 to quiet house and were greeted by Lucy. We did not see our Chinese guests until much later in the evening. As soon as I had unpacked I rushed off in my Mini to see Oli who has been having to cope with the babies on her own as Miguel's mother is in hospital at the moment. I wish her a speedy recovery. It was great to see Elliot and Juliet again. Elliot is talking 19 to a dozen in fast Spanish and both Oli and I have to talk to him all the time in English which doesn't make life easy. He understands both languages but for the moment prefers Spanish. It was the same when my girls were little. I had to persevere and persevere I do. Eladio came later and brought fresh Spanish tortillas for dinner courtesy of dear Lucy. She held the fort so well for us in our absence. We all had dinner together and left quite late, at around 10.30. The best thing about coming home, I always say, is sleeping in your own bed. Of course the beds in our other houses are ours but there is nothing like the one in our main house here outside Madrid. I feel at home in Asturias, Santa Pola and Montrondo but they can't begin to compare to our real home, the best place in the world. We love to go away but we also love coming back. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">On <b>Thursday</b> I was up at 6.15. There is not much to tell about Thursday except that we did the food shopping as our cupboards were completely bare. So let me move onto Friday, the most exciting day of the week. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">On Friday Elliot was to graduate from Nursery school. I am no fan of children graduating - probably yet another new tradition imported from the US like Halloween, Baby showers, parties for 15 year olds, Black Friday, not to mention Valentine's day. But as Elliot is my grandchild I was delighted to attend the ceremony. As I watched I wondered if I would still be around when he really graduates; from University that is. I hope so. Eladio who was a teacher thought the idea a bit ridiculous as Elliot is only 2 but pointed out that appearing in public was a good lesson at his age and it was, except that he was totally overwhelmed by everything. I should explain that he was "graduating" from his nursery school and will be starting his new school when he turns 3 in September. He is a big boy for his age and we noticed he was the tallest of all the children. That doesn't mean he will be tall, although I hope he will. I remember when I was 12, I was one of the tallest in my class at St. Joseph's College but within a year I had been outgrown by most and only grew to 5ft 4inches. That's very unfair as both my parents and my brother were very tall people.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Elliot  had a temperature the night before and was not well but couldn't miss his "big day". He was dressed in a bow tie as all the boys were and he looked smashing. I think he was pleased with his outfit too.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjDUVTQPHuYvzGzL3kqo1yaA9ghIPGbwrO7zn-02bVfso9-aQjj5sUKXuqHsszKdsLkcZNI3tZmNhcb9LxLGDnZ6Hr7OTxuQfO_76ltz_QVGOBq-SAXODY53-YKpJC_1hkEQztVefmcJsR6dF9uTC-nK0KF1WpU8otld21I7l0s0gQ7l88JigM/s2000/E%20ready%20in%20the%20morning.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjDUVTQPHuYvzGzL3kqo1yaA9ghIPGbwrO7zn-02bVfso9-aQjj5sUKXuqHsszKdsLkcZNI3tZmNhcb9LxLGDnZ6Hr7OTxuQfO_76ltz_QVGOBq-SAXODY53-YKpJC_1hkEQztVefmcJsR6dF9uTC-nK0KF1WpU8otld21I7l0s0gQ7l88JigM/w225-h400/E%20ready%20in%20the%20morning.jpg" width="225"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Elliot ready for his "graduation"</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">He looked absolutely lovely.

Miguel, his father and Juliet, his sister were there but not his mother as she had to work that day. She was busy reporting on the Ryanair strike. You can see the <a href="https://twitter.com/LaHoraTVE/status/1540285772879773698?s=20&amp;t=D-9XT-SRWMq663QDXJpVTA">piece she did  here</a> where she interviewed the head of HR worldwide.

We had not been for a walk for a long time as we have been away and there weren't many chances. The weather was perfect and has been so since we got back from Asturias with long sunny days but gone are the high temperatures. Thus we also had a pleasant lunch outside. Our Chinese guests went away on Friday for 3 nights so we were alone at home until our next guests, 7 young girls, arrived that evening. Thus I was able to enjoy my book by the pool although I didn't go in as it wasn't warm enough.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Being Friday I had booked a table for dinner. I used The Fork app and made a great find that night in <a href="http://www.lubora.com/">"Lúbora"</a> in a very quiet area of nearby Boadilla. It had a very high score of 9.3 and I went for the tasting menu. Eladio isn't into them usually but didn't mind too much. The small dishes of which there were 8, 7 savoury and 1 dessert, were far from small and we couldn't manage the last 2 savoury dishes we were so full. I loved everything they put in front of us; salmorejo, quail egg on toast with some funny but delicious meat, chickpeas with large prawns, "ceviche" and a wonderful fish dish. It was all so creative and tasty I know we will be back.

I find it fascinating but I have always loved history which was my favourite subject at school. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><b>Saturday </b>came. I had ordered a new washing machine and a new microwave. Both were ordered the day before and both arrived on Saturday. Meanwhile in Asturias, Jesús the plumber, was installing the new bath. He sent me photos and I later paid him using that marvelous payment app called "Bizum" which works in Spain only I think.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqvwpsnjU4JXam5M71ZNZEXBeNZttvIg_brPxcTbHxEli2vzkUTFXUFoon_zcehHoSqZ58jLiWJIWBJ_wUgdP50ap1egExUHlJ1VgVj8pfAWkXTsghTGEUYSZjVlbwMtO8VzuHJZcz233Ys1YA8dKGL7j1PgOFDR350iM_2B4OW8zK1rsZk2s/s1600/new%20bath.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqvwpsnjU4JXam5M71ZNZEXBeNZttvIg_brPxcTbHxEli2vzkUTFXUFoon_zcehHoSqZ58jLiWJIWBJ_wUgdP50ap1egExUHlJ1VgVj8pfAWkXTsghTGEUYSZjVlbwMtO8VzuHJZcz233Ys1YA8dKGL7j1PgOFDR350iM_2B4OW8zK1rsZk2s/w400-h300/new%20bath.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>New bath at our house in Asturias</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We went on our walk again and had coffee at home for once. I made a delicious lunch of stuffed shoulder of lamb from a made up Moroccan recipe. In the afternoon Oli needed my help with the children as Miguel was with his mother at the hospital. I could see Elliot wasn't well. He had a white face and red eyes but still refuses his medicine. We took them to a spectacular new park near where they live called "Parque Miguel Angel Blanco".  I have never seen anything like it. Yes there are swings, a roundabout and slides but what slides. They are more like helter skelters. It's probably the best children's play ground in Spain.
