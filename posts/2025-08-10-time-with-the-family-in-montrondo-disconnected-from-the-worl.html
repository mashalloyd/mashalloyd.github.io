It's the longest period I remember us being here in recent years. We have stayed longer than usual not just because we love the place but to escape from the extreme heat of Madrid where it is sizzling with temperatures hovering 40ºc.</p><p>We have been disconnected in many ways. The internet coverage seems to have collapsed with no signal many times. That's all fine except that I have to run my rental business from here which hasn't been easy. We have not watched the TV since we got here&nbsp; because it hardly works but that I don't mind as I am fed up of the world news. Only two items spring to mind, the xenophobic move by the far right party in Jumilla, Spain, which seeks to ban Muslim festivals and the possible peace talks with Trump and Putin in Alaska of all places. But if Zelensky is not invited there will be no deal.</p><p><b>Last Sunday</b> was the day after the Santa Marta fiesta. We didn't go to the dance which didn't start until 11.30 at night which is far too late for us. In the old days Suzy would have been up all night, like many people but she came home early.&nbsp;</p><p>The village was full and in our family only we counted 42 people. With Oli and family we were 7 at home which was rather a challenge to cook for every day. I was a bit overwhelmed. As to cleaning around everyone, that was not easy either.&nbsp;</p><p>That morning Internet had gone so I went to publish my blog from Senra, a nearby village. By the time I got there it had come back but I stayed at the grumpy man's bar to publish it in peace.</p><p>I spent the morning cooking but most times I did, it was not appreciated by my grandchildren who are not good eaters and many times had tantrums at meal times. In the afternoon I tried to get some peace at the back of the house which is usually a no go area for kids, but they had decided to play hide and seek there. No place was child free.</p><p>We are enjoying village life and part of that is buying freshly laid eggs from the villagers. We got ours from Manolo, a retired farmer who keeps 24 hens, 2 pigs and tends to his kitchen gardens. He gave us 2 courgettes, on top of another 2 we had been given. Courgettes are not my favourite vegetable but they are ok in soups. In a field near the farmer's house we saw 2 horses which thrilled Juliet who had come with us.&nbsp;</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg0BL4WqP_7rIXRIpJnLtCBkQj8BlP7PwtNdpS9KnBKVhkjORQpraQajKE6s0tJstMteh7jyq26My6XFoYwAWBUyNSJU86Qb78ZzXTqu5Bb7v11rlUA-vSSzqXGkPBjcBZvqH8nUei99Or6ilLKCUP5kX9X7DuenQr69Yy6Kgfo3hkREoYZKc8bgQ/s4000/Sun%203rd%20aug%20eggs.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1848" data-original-width="4000" height="185" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg0BL4WqP_7rIXRIpJnLtCBkQj8BlP7PwtNdpS9KnBKVhkjORQpraQajKE6s0tJstMteh7jyq26My6XFoYwAWBUyNSJU86Qb78ZzXTqu5Bb7v11rlUA-vSSzqXGkPBjcBZvqH8nUei99Or6ilLKCUP5kX9X7DuenQr69Yy6Kgfo3hkREoYZKc8bgQ/w400-h185/Sun%203rd%20aug%20eggs.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Horses in Montrondo</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>She was fascinated with Manolo and kept touching his face and asking him about his farm. Bless the man, he didn't mind.</p><p>It was on Sunday that Juliet learned to ride a bike; an important part of children's stays here. There are bikes of all sizes everywhere. Here she is on her bike feeling proud of herself.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMLv2q0LlD8xY8l8rTMqds1ORa0D32GvOp70l_dbl44erd5EifdBDYIgUvkUeyk4HxrSrU6OA2DfxHxUqs3n54WyaUPbuNXZVwnGNz3BSWt9j-mtNC6bBAsXykHjfn85nhiywXq36D-yy9pwhLeOUdp5uCqrVKv1KxaUHU2P4aN0EtXe34fmlC5Q/s1440/Tues%205th%20(2).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1440" data-original-width="1440" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMLv2q0LlD8xY8l8rTMqds1ORa0D32GvOp70l_dbl44erd5EifdBDYIgUvkUeyk4HxrSrU6OA2DfxHxUqs3n54WyaUPbuNXZVwnGNz3BSWt9j-mtNC6bBAsXykHjfn85nhiywXq36D-yy9pwhLeOUdp5uCqrVKv1KxaUHU2P4aN0EtXe34fmlC5Q/w400-h400/Tues%205th%20(2).jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Juliet learns to ride a bike</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>As to Elliot, aged nearly 6, he is a pro. That day he rode to Murias and back for the first time. It's an easy ride there but a bit uphill coming back. He came back elated and proud of himself too.</p><p>Oli made Spanish tortilla for dinner with the eggs which tasted delicious. Later I went for a walk to Murias and back with Suzy which we have done most nights since we got here. It's vital daily exercise for us and for Pippa.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Monday</b> came and I was up at 5.30 which is a bit extreme. I have been sleeping better here than in Madrid but I never get enough sleep. That night Eladio didn't sleep either. He has lumbago and was in a lot of pain. Thus Suzy and I who were going shopping with Dolores to Villablino, took him with us to see a doctor. He saw a lovely elderly lady doctor who told us she was born in Murias. We took along his latest medical report and she prescribed him more medicine including 3 steroid injections, one of which she gave him on the spot. They worked their magic and now he is a lot, lot better.</p><p>While we were in Villablino, tons and tons of firewood arrived to be shared between the houses belonging to Eladio's siblings. Oli told us later that everyone took part in unloading the wood and piling it up for all of us. Here is a photo of the human chain unloading the wood logs.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEicttFc3YU7i5ohe1N0R0iGgxFNHtG_DgpQ-ejekm4zer9D7LuCMqFIcECZSpEeKC8iGPWRZ6sXJoTdImLOE_94bLbsUWuLo4pOIPsrVFogeCFZJ_Ws-hLf-5htyYAGzccdF2a1Ml_f6YAVb32-_bvN0pgNBOhcDSkkuw4lBcDx9cqWqs9rbGQecA/s2000/Mon%204th%20Aug.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img border="0" data-original-height="1500" data-original-width="2000" height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEicttFc3YU7i5ohe1N0R0iGgxFNHtG_DgpQ-ejekm4zer9D7LuCMqFIcECZSpEeKC8iGPWRZ6sXJoTdImLOE_94bLbsUWuLo4pOIPsrVFogeCFZJ_Ws-hLf-5htyYAGzccdF2a1Ml_f6YAVb32-_bvN0pgNBOhcDSkkuw4lBcDx9cqWqs9rbGQecA/w400-h300/Mon%204th%20Aug.jpg" width="400" /></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>All the family unloading the fire wood which arrived this week</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><p>Again Internet was intermittent which was a problem when I had to deal with a leak from the bathroom at our apartment in Santa Pola where a Dutch family was staying. It took me most of the day to sort out but I did it. It involved many people, my neighbours, the cleaning lady who had to open the door for the plumber, our insurance company and of course the guests who weren't too happy. It was solved in one day which is quite a miracle.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Tuesday</b> came and a big group of the younger generation in our family went up the Tambarón mountain which is over 2000 metres high.&nbsp; They wouldn't be able to do that today because of the forest fire. The round trip is about 16km and it's quite a trek. I have done it twice now but have no inclination ever to do it again as you come back absolutely exhausted.</p><p>While they were out I spent 1.5h on the phone to Movistar, our internet provider. I ordered a new router which arrived the next day but didn't work as there is not enough coverage. Their antenna is old and needs replacing, which is whey the signal keeps coming and going. Those who have Vodafone though are lucky as the antenna is new. Thus you had me using Oli's phone as a hot spot but now she is not here.&nbsp;</p><p>Juliet only got up after my phone call and as she does often, she spends time with Pippa, stroking her. This week she invited her to her birthday party in September hahahaha. Here is a lovely photo of them together.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1QHARLQ53mTpp75o7_yx2gERs1ZfO9iMiMXiSQRSuNFtNRV-ouAuLbzRbXKAkhErql7AL1Wo9XQbs6NFiODj493D6KWsMybeENandM7wKVWwzYHXKYGwLpAgGwVYoFU-M6KIy2bV4lDwQTDYdaTfwq2oxJYevfX2qdSmRs1F9IFNdtqQzxCMNmg/s4000/Tues%205th%20August.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1848" data-original-width="4000" height="185" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1QHARLQ53mTpp75o7_yx2gERs1ZfO9iMiMXiSQRSuNFtNRV-ouAuLbzRbXKAkhErql7AL1Wo9XQbs6NFiODj493D6KWsMybeENandM7wKVWwzYHXKYGwLpAgGwVYoFU-M6KIy2bV4lDwQTDYdaTfwq2oxJYevfX2qdSmRs1F9IFNdtqQzxCMNmg/w400-h185/Tues%205th%20August.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Juliet with Pippa</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><p>Funnily enough the highlight of family life this week was going with Eladio to Villablino for the Volvo's annual MOT. It is 23 years old and I was worried if it didn't pass the test what we would do here without a car. It was lovely to be just the four of us.&nbsp; We had to wait a while in the heat but found a shady part to sit and wait. Oli took a great video of us and a photo, the one I have used as this week's feature photo.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen='allowfullscreen' webkitallowfullscreen='webkitallowfullscreen' mozallowfullscreen='mozallowfullscreen' width='320' height='266' src='https://www.blogger.com/video.g?token=AD6v5dx-roAvHZ6agTNH9XdVi8uFmBJ0RvMCONV5-rmTITIsqaKu-ALv71QTbkAwbUY7gExwyXuirV--CdU' class='b-hbp-video b-uploaded' frameborder='0'></iframe></div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Fun at the MOT</i></div><p><br /></p><p>We were on tenterhooks waiting and hoping it would pass the test. Amazingly, it did. It was lovely to be just the four of us and we spent quality time together after which we went once again to the Gadis supermarket where we got even more provisions. Our fridge has been groaning all week and when Miguel kept bringing huge melons and water melons I was at my wit's end as to where to put them.&nbsp;</p><p>We came home to find preparations for a birthday party for one of the little ones who was turning 5. That got us all together and was such fun. What made it even more fun when one of the older cousins took a video of us oldies which you can see below. She is so good at it and we laughed and laughed enjoying the moment. There are no photos of the party as most of Eladio's family don't want their children to appear on internet which I have to respect as I have been in trouble for that years ago after which I never took photos of them again. Thankfully Oli doesn't mind at all. Thank you darling.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen='allowfullscreen' webkitallowfullscreen='webkitallowfullscreen' mozallowfullscreen='mozallowfullscreen' width='320' height='266' src='https://www.blogger.com/video.g?token=AD6v5dwZ8Zi0Il_fwCt4YiWBwDHCuKkxmwjiNw1azuX8p66HL_oJSNNiTdKYqzrFiBS40mPU2dUp5QFWTRU' class='b-hbp-video b-uploaded' frameborder='0'></iframe></div><br /><p style="text-align: center;"><i>Us oldies having fun in Montrondo</i></p><p>After my walk with Suzy I got my best night's sleep not waking up till 7.30 am on <b>Wednesday</b>. It was not a good day for her though as she is in the throes of deep depression and social anxiety. I am sure she needs her medication changed and better therapy. It is agony to watch her but I am doing my best to help her.</p><p>I made spaghetti bolognese for lunch which is generally the kids' favourite food but they ate very badly during their stay. When I see Elliot doing so much exercise I wonder why he doesn't eat a bit better but he will survive of course.</p><p>The kids made a racket during our siesta. Our bedroom is below the lounge and kitchen and the floor boards are not insulated so we hear all their noise. Now they are gone and it is quiet but I do miss them. I don't miss their tantrums though, hahaha.</p><p>That day I was happy to get a 9 out of 10 on Booking from a Dutch family who left that day. They seemed to have had a marvelous time and loved our house, not so a French family who came next and gave me nothing but headaches. Sometimes I feel like chucking it all in. Guests can be lovely and they can be awful.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Thursday</b> was Oli's last day with us. We gave her a break that morning, looking after the kids so she and Miguel could have some alone time while shopping in Villablino for food to take to France. They actually behaved quite well and spent most of the time with their little cousins. Here is a moment I captured on camera while Eladio and Suzy were watching the little mites.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLuC4g8HUo5NeLiYjc4lK17x7W9ea6UWg-K_ygYBSjmzrLAH-qaolSysHmNr_MO0OqSn2YDuXDEH4U6-eLY_n7xHd5QFssUdG5DOK1EBBJRkcN4sV-ZAL7JeUvoMdk6DV6H4Y8CeLAjAUNJx0KdCZcWO4ueasmMMvgd_NSM2ffc-FzcGUdC1qFTQ/s4000/Thurs%207th%20Aug.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="4000" data-original-width="1848" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhLuC4g8HUo5NeLiYjc4lK17x7W9ea6UWg-K_ygYBSjmzrLAH-qaolSysHmNr_MO0OqSn2YDuXDEH4U6-eLY_n7xHd5QFssUdG5DOK1EBBJRkcN4sV-ZAL7JeUvoMdk6DV6H4Y8CeLAjAUNJx0KdCZcWO4ueasmMMvgd_NSM2ffc-FzcGUdC1qFTQ/w185-h400/Thurs%207th%20Aug.jpg" width="185" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio and Suzy&nbsp;</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>There were more tantrums at lunch time and in the afternoon when we served coffee and cakes for 14 people. Imagine. Again I didn't take photos as the family are not keen on appearing on internet. That's why there are so few photos in this week's post.&nbsp;</p><p>Just as Suzy and I were serving coffee, I got a message from my French guest who turned out to be a bloody nightmare. There was a broken window among all her complaints. How on earth was I to deal with that? Well, I managed but then there was another broken window which a handyman called Hector fixed that day and the next. The guest had not read any of my house information pack&nbsp; so was asking me questions until late at night. She told me the beds were badly made, there was no washing up liquid and it went on and on. She was very rude and I kept having to eat humble pie which I hate. I sorted all her issues as best I could and even offered to reimburse her and to leave if they weren't happy. I just hoped I would sleep that night not worrying. I get very stressed in these situations and I tell myself I have to be cool, calm and collected which is very difficult for me. Those were words my father told me when, as a child I told him I wanted to be a nurse. How right he was.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Friday </b>dawned, the day Oli and family were going to France. It was a bitter sweet moment. On the one hand with the kids life was chaotic but without them we felt lonely. But we had some lovely moments with Juliet and Elliot.I quietly observed my grandson while he was petting Pippa gently, quietly saying goodbye to our dog. It was sad to see them go and we hugged our grandchildren non stop. After they left we took Elliot's red bike on which he had so much fun, to keep it to take home. I took a picture where you can also see our house sandwiched in between houses belonging to Eladio's siblings.&nbsp;</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEheaFTqKmVLgrpGFqvktjM_KfgBKUnqhLdkBrmPCrXpqtLZN29Yw8BrMBR123xmlbuQHRpsuGPYwb_WdhS0MQ3E473jWlMXDYJPiLylhKVYD_MSQUyLLMqgUjrDY5AQPzW7fHwsJdRt5UxRZICU6rOcevnX9WAdxX3aosQ1QHi5mx0kQ8KnPotv9g/s4000/Friday%208th.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1848" data-original-width="4000" height="185" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEheaFTqKmVLgrpGFqvktjM_KfgBKUnqhLdkBrmPCrXpqtLZN29Yw8BrMBR123xmlbuQHRpsuGPYwb_WdhS0MQ3E473jWlMXDYJPiLylhKVYD_MSQUyLLMqgUjrDY5AQPzW7fHwsJdRt5UxRZICU6rOcevnX9WAdxX3aosQ1QHi5mx0kQ8KnPotv9g/w400-h185/Friday%208th.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our house which is in the middle of three houses.

It rained for the first time in yonks and we all hoped it would put out the fire but it didn't.&nbsp;</p><p>My day ended with an apology from the French lady, grateful for all my efforts to sort out her problems. She told me, in other words that she was a bit OCD about tidiness and cleanliness and apologised for her behaviour. Amazing!&nbsp;</p><p><b>Saturday</b> was a very quiet day and once again it was very hot. We did more washing and made up the beds upstairs. We also went for coffee to Senra and were joined by José Antonio and Dolores. That was the highlight of the day. The fire started again around midday; it was one of the 7 fires raging just in the province of León. It was located in the mountains on the path to a village called Fasgar. The fear is it could destroy Spain's biggest birch tree forest, "el abedular".</p><p>While the fire raged and you could smell the smoke, it was too hot to be outside by the apple trees so I retired to our much cooler room and had a 2 hour siesta. Later when we went for our evening walk we could clearly see the fire.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEif06KeKf0oe5Q3Vm6yt9YhU3GAvIkCyLZuKfPhXmNFC8Rzm9Sl12mIIxCcuScOmDs_W-aHL_sXJoeOwHs3tsGAenb8EnA7OBhogfS33qFXyIBH7GAt8UPjRiJQxqkd4T4pUdLYu1ZajjavRFICtBDw4LNB5UuhGcP0ZLgwSkPCXlwa3elJkPI7pw/s1600/fire%20saturday%20night.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="739" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEif06KeKf0oe5Q3Vm6yt9YhU3GAvIkCyLZuKfPhXmNFC8Rzm9Sl12mIIxCcuScOmDs_W-aHL_sXJoeOwHs3tsGAenb8EnA7OBhogfS33qFXyIBH7GAt8UPjRiJQxqkd4T4pUdLYu1ZajjavRFICtBDw4LNB5UuhGcP0ZLgwSkPCXlwa3elJkPI7pw/w185-h400/fire%20saturday%20night.jpg" width="185" /></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><i>Fire in the mountains surrounding Montrondo</i></span></span></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><p><span style="vertical-align: inherit;"><span style="vertical-align: inherit;">It didn't spoil our walk but did worry us as it did all the village and people were out on the street watching it. The only danger is if the wind changes and the smoke reaches Montrondo which I hope won't happen.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p>Today is <b>Sunday</b> and the smoke is still there but I couldn't see the fire itself. I do hope it gets extinguished before it does too much damage.</p><p>Now I am at the end of this week's post, I hope I have enough signal to upload all the photos and publish it. I have ordered a router from Vodafone but they sent the wrong SIM card and hopefully a new one will come tomorrow. Fingers crossed it does and that the router can be installed and we will no longer be so disconnected from the world.</p><p>That's it from me for this week. I hope you are all well and I wish you a happy Sunday,</p><p>All the best, Masha</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
