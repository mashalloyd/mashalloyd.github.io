My beloved Aunty Gloria, my father's sister.</i></td></tr></tbody></table><span style="text-align: justify;">Fifty
years ago today, on 23</span><sup style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify;">rd</sup><span style="text-align: justify;"> May 1971, a whole family from Ickenham died
tragically in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviogenex_Flight_130">air crash at Rijeka</a> airport in former Yugoslavia. My Aunt
Gloria, née Lloyd, my uncle, Derek Orchard and their children, Jacqueline (12),
Michael (9) and Antony (7) are still remembered today not just by my family but
by many people from the village. Revd. V.B. Wynburne, vicar at the time of St.
Giles Church, wrote in the Ickenham Church News in July 1971 “</span><i style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: justify;">They were so
much an integral part of the community in general and the church in particular
that we all feel a tremendous sense of loss</i><span style="text-align: justify;">”. That loss has never gone
away.</span><p></p><p>

</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Gloria
was born in Sledmere, North Yorkshire, in 1926. She was the daughter of a
clergyman, my grandfather, Revd. Canon John Lloyd, and Dorothy Gertrude née
Scull, an accomplished pianist. Her siblings were my father, Charles Courtenay
Lloyd and Raymond who sadly died of polio in 1938 aged just 16.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>After
Sledmere, the family moved to Henbury near Bristol. Gloria attended the Clergy
Daughters’ School in Bristol, later named St. Brandon’s School. During the war
she was evacuated to Wells. She came of age just before the war ended and,
wanting to do her bit, served in the WRACS as a private and corporal. She was a
skilled driver and mechanic. My father’s sister was a practical, loving, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>no- nonsense, get-on-with it sort of person,
but at the same time, very jolly, independent and family orientated. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Gloria
met and fell in love with Derek Orchard on the Island of Krk in Croatia. It was
to what they called “Mummy and Daddy’s island” that they were to take the
children on holiday that fateful day in May. Derek, an only child, was born in
Middlesex in 1930 and the couple were married by my grandfather at his church,
St. Mary’s in Henbury, Bristol, on the day of my birth, 8<sup>th</sup> February
1957. Derek was a chartered engineer with Vickers. I remember him riding to
work on his Vespa. I should also add he was as fan of Tottenham Hotspurs. My
memory is a bit fuzzy after 50 years but I do remember that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>As
many young married couples, they worked hard to make a living and form a family.
After their wedding they went to live in Ickenham at 18 Ivy House Road. Gloria
had time to run her home, look after her children, contribute to the community
and also look care of her parents. After her father’s retirement my grandparents
moved to Ickenham, to 17 Hoylake Crescent, to be near them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>I
was witness to all this because as a family, my parents, brother and I spent
every Christmas in Ickenham when we were children. They were the closest family
we had and my father and I are their only surviving direct relatives. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>We also spent many Easter and summer holidays with
them. Gloria loved to drive and would take us on trips in her old Humber to
special places such as Burnham Beeches, Pinewood Studios, Windsor, the Model
Village in Beaconsfield and The Natural History Museum in London. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I remember once Uncle Derek taking us all to
see the Christmas lights in London. Those were happy times. I have fond
memories of Ickenham, of going to church, to the library and to do the shopping
with my Aunt at Budgens supermarket on Swakeleys Road or of playing on the
swings with my cousins at the end of Ivy House Road. My Aunty Gloria made us
tea every day in her dining room using real china which always included jam
sandwiches. I worshipped her and always regret never telling her I loved her
but that would have been too emotional in those days. In the evenings, we would
play monopoly or other games. Both she and Jacqueline played my grandmother’s
beautiful old piano which is now at my house in Madrid, sadly collecting dust. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>They
were very much part of the community in Ickenham. Gloria and Derek played
badminton and attended events popular at the time such as “cheese and wine
parties” at the church hall. Gloria was on the Mothers’ Union Committee, the
family went regularly to St. Giles Church, Michael sang in the choir, the boys
went to the Cubs and all three children attended Breakspear School. Jacqueline
left Breakspear in the summer of 1970 and attended Hillingdon Court Covent
School. There she met <b>Sally Ackroyd</b> who became her best friend.
Neighbours have described to me how Gloria <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>went out of her way to help them. One of
Michael’s school frinds, <b>Boo Smith</b> , recalls how Gloria gave her mother
Jacqueline’s school dresses with her name stitched on the night before they
left on that fatal journey. <b>Boo</b> explained that “<i>all the Mums in the
area were very friendly and supportive of one another</i>”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>The
family never went away on a real holiday until that fateful trip. Besides, life
was busy and Gloria had to take care of her mother in her latter years. Only
when my grandmother died in December 1970 were they able to take a family holiday
abroad. Of course, they chose “Mummy and Daddy’s island”. It was an exciting
time for them, preparing to go and there was lots to do. Initially Jacqueline
was to travel out later when her school broke up but her mother didn’t want her
to travel alone. Michael joked with fellow choirboys at St. Giles, about
missing evening service. <b>Sally Ackroyd</b> called Jacqueline a “<i>kind and
gentle soul</i>” and described how she went to her house the day they were
leaving to get a stamp for a letter. That stamp may well have been for my
aunt’s last letter to my father which I still have. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>In it she writes: “<i>Frantically preparing to
go tomorrow. Due to take off from Gatwick 5.30 pm. Tomorrow, arriving Krk
airport 9.45 pm. Perhaps we could pop up and see you in between Norwich and any
other plans you have. Love from all to all. Gloria</i>”. It’s chilling, but we
would never see them again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>That
tragic night my family and I were watching the news when the accident was
announced. I was 14 at the time, just 2 years older than Jacqueline. My father
mentioned Gloria and family were going to Yugoslavia but he didn’t know on what
flight. He rang their house in Ickenham and there was no reply. The next day, I
went to school as usual and only when I came back in the afternoon, did I find
out the terrible news.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was my mother
who told me. She described how the authorities had rung my father in the
morning to give him the news. When he put the receiver down, he said to my
mother: “I<i> only have you left now</i>”. He had now lost his last remaining sibling.
He is still alive today, having just celebrated his 102<sup>nd</sup> birthday
and every day of his life since that dreadful call he has missed and mourned
the death of his sister and her family. As for me, something died inside me
when I heard the news. I was handed a cross I would bear all my life but at the
same time I carry them all in my heart. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>It is something that never goes away. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>As
a family we took a last journey to Ickenham for the memorial service. It was
hard walking out of Ickenham Tube station and knowing they would not be at
home. Even so, that day we visited 18 Ivy House Road. I remember going into
Jacqueline’s bedroom, feeling devastated and empty. I found her hairbrush and
took some of the hair which I wore in a locket for many years. We stayed at 23
Hoylake Crescent with the Andrews’ family, neighbours of my grandparents.
Eleanor Andrews<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>was a dear friend of
both my aunt and grandmother. My father though spent that night by himself in
the lounge at his sister’s house. He was heartbroken but never showed his
feelings and rarely talked about the tragedy ever again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b><span>Tributes
and memories of those from Ickenham who remember the Orchard family. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>Their
death was a huge shock to us but also to the community I learned. I have missed
them every day of my life as has my father so I was amazed to find that many
people still remember them today, especially the friends and class mates of
Jacqueline, Michael and Antony. Recently Michael’s friend called Helen Gill who
I didn’t know at all wrote to me out of the blue: “<i>I went to school with
Michael and walked home with him. I have always remembered the sadness of
losing him and the loss of his family – it was devastating for the whole
community and must have been so sad for your family</i>”. She also told me the
school was so upset and that the tragedy never left her. I think it never left
anyone who knew them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>All
these years I had no idea how many lives the Orchard family had also touched
and I recently found some of these people on the village Facebook group page.
The response was incredible and warmed my heart. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><b>Peter Moxon</b> writes “<i>I remember
Michael and the Orchard family. We were at Breakspear School together and in
the same class. I still remember the day the terrible news was announced in
school assembly</i>.” He also said “<i>the Orchards were a lovely family and I
would say that Michael was my best friend at Breakspear. I often visited their
house after school</i>”. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Peter’s father
recalls Derek taking Michael and him up to London to see HMS Belfast. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><b>Barbara Head</b> writes: “<i>There was a
sadness in the village following the tragedy</i>” and <b>Sally Ackroyd</b>
admits “<i>I still look up at Jacqueline’s window each time I walk down Ivy
House Road</i>”. She added <i>“it was hard when she died, such a shock. I put a
rose in their grave last Christmas and gave it a brush</i>. Jacqueline would be
62 now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><b>Shirley Masson</b> writes “<i>I
remember them. I was in the same year as Antony at Breakspear. I think of them
from time to time. I remember the shock of the news</i>”. Many of those who
remember them leave flowers at their grave from time to time and even clean the
headstone. <b>Hazel Elliot</b> wrote: “<i>I lived in Ickenham and went to
Breakspear. I think I was the year above Michael. I remember Mr. Ettling, our
headmaster, telling us though as young children I don’t think we realised the
tragedy and enormity of it. I always thought of the family whenever I walked
along Ivy House Road and past their house</i>. <b>Tim Price</b> who was friends
with Antony told me that his parents were friends of Antony’s and that it was “<i>very
sad and will never be forgotten</i>”. <b>Wendy Frany</b> writes<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>“<i>the whole of my family was devastated
when the accident happened …. It was<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>a tremendous
shock, losing them all like that, but we were always somehow grateful that they
died together</i>”. <b>Boo Smith</b> recalls “<i>I remember walking home from
school the day after the accident and another little girl I often walked home
with<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>said to me, “I am glad they are all
in heaven together”. … as children we took great comfort from those thoughts”</i>.
<b>Boo</b> also told me her memories of the night they died: “<i>The lady who
lived next door to Gloria was called Audrey Jinks who was often popping in to
see our Mum. I still have a clear memory of that fateful night when Audrey came
down to Mum realising that the family was on that flight</i>”. <b>Cathy Bryant</b>
writes: “<i>yes I remember your lovely relatives as my parents were their
friends and my brother, sister and myself were the same ages as Jacqueline,
Michael and Antony. We remember many happy times at both our house and Ivy
House playing and going to Breakspear and church. I was only 7 when the air
crash happened and remember Mr. Ettling telling us in assembly. So devastating,
will never forget</i>,” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>The
community was so stunned and shocked it decided to raise funds for a special
memorial stained glass window at St. Giles. It is a fitting way to remember
this much loved family who so unfairly met their death too soon in life and in
such a tragic way. It was a way of never forgetting. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span>No,
we cannot forget and this is why special prayers were said for the Orchard
family at St. Giles Church today. I would like to thank Revd. Felicity Davies and the Church Administrator, Stephanie White, for making this possible. I would have liked to be there but because
of Covid that was not possible. I hope we can hold a belated 50<sup>th</sup>
anniversary memorial service and get together next year. I remember the turnout
at their memorial service on May 27<sup>th</sup> 1971. The church was so packed
not all could enter. I hope we can fill it again in memory of Gloria, Derek,
Jacqueline, Michael and Antony when we meet next year to pay tribute to them
and share together the loss that never went away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
