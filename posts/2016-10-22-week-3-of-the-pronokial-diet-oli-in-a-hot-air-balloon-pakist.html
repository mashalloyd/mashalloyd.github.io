<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It is Saturday morning and we are here for the weekend
or rather we have come to celebrate my niece Laura’s wedding to her fiancé Dani.  Actually they got married in a registry office in the middle of the week with just their parents and god parents. There will be a family lunch in
León today to celebrate.  It’s our 4<sup>th</sup>
wedding this year, after Lucia’s, Miguel’s and Paula’s.  More about it later.<o:p></o:p></span><br></br>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The week was quiet but intensive, work wise, especially
to do with the merge after MásMóvil bought Yoigo in which I am involved
and affected as are all the employees, 420 from our new owner and 100 from
Yoigo.  Imagine the challenges but there
are also lots of synergies.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Let me start from where I left off last Sunday.  It was a quiet day at home and it was nice to
be joined by Oli.  The two of us went
shopping to El Corté Inglés where we went to pick up a watch of mine which had been
repaired.  Of course once there we did
some shopping.  It’s such an amazing
store; as soon as you go in you are tempted by so much.  Later we had dinner together and we all
watched Jordi Evole’s Salvados documentary on the plight of migrants at sea in
the Mediterranean.  I had expected so
much more from this singular and popular journalist but I was
disappointed.  I really should have
watched a rival channel’s first episode of a documentary on the reunion of the
participants 15 years on of Operación Triunfo (successful reality singing
talent show).  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Thanks to the internet I was able to watch it the next
day and loved every minute of it.  You
can see it </span><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/:%20http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/ot-el-reencuentro/reencuentro-ot-parte-1/3759074/" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">here</a><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">. I can imagine my Finnish friend Anne adoring every moment of
it as it was aired when she lived here when she worked for Nokia Spain and she watched it every week. The whole of Spain fell in love with the participants;
especially the finalists, the winner Rosa and runners up, David Bustamante,
David Bisbal, Chenoa and Manu Tenorio.  I
look forward to episode two on Sunday which again I shall probably watch online
later.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Monday, the end of week 2 of my Pronokal diet, I
got on the scales.  The week before I had
lost 2 kilos and was hoping for another 2 to be shed. I was disappointed when I
had only gone down 900 grammes.  Luckily
I weighed myself on Friday morning too and had gone down a further 400 making
the total weight loss so far 3.8 kilos. 
I am certainly noticing it in my clothes. I can even notice it in my
hands as my wedding ring is looser.  I am
feeling great although I have to admit the diet is probably the most difficult
I have ever done but I shall stick to it, come what may. Soon you will see the
slimmer Masha. Then we will see how long it lasts hahaha. <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">One of the things I did on Monday was go to the
appointment with the social security office to get the 2 years I had been on
the dole in 1999 and 2005 incorporated into my “vida laboral” (work life register)
which are important for my future pension. 
Oh the bureaucracy!  I had to
fight at the office in Alcorcón where I was told I should have gone to the one
in Majadahonda.  On the automated phone
call to book the appointment because of my post code I was sent to Alcorcón. So
we protested and thankfully got this office to do the paperwork.  At least we found out that those 2 years are
on their system but now we have to wait probably more than a month for them to
appear on the register.  And I will get
no notification and will have to find out myself when that happens. What a
stupid system!!!  We came home feeling
cross.  I can’t stand bureaucracy and old
fashioned systems and wish the Spanish administration would keep up with the
times. One phone call or an app on mobile phones should do the job as happens
in other more modern countries. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Tuesday was a historic one for Yoigo.  The Swedes were coming to say goodbye and I
had arranged the employee event where we all get together and which I call Yoigo
Mornings. I invented them at Nokia and they are a great success. It was a
historic day as it would be the last one we would celebrate as a Yoigo team of
employees as we have been bought by a small Spanish operator. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">When the final negotiations took place a few weeks
ago, I wrote here that I had missed a goodbye from our previous owners,
TeliaSonera (now called The Telia Company). Well we got it on Tuesday but were
all a little bit disappointed as we had hoped for some token of recognition for
our efforts over the last 10 years to build Yoigo to what it is today; a
company that has nearly 4 million customers with just 100 employees.  But Swedes are Swedes and all we got was a
cup of coffee and some snacks, none of which I could partake in because of my
Pronokal diet.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Work went on and that morning there was a press
release issued by the BNB branch Cetelem to announce financing of our terminals
to customers.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I also had a tense time that morning over,
who in the future would be in charge of events; my domain and something I have
been doing for 10 years with great success. On Wednesday, a wet and
nasty day,  I would be notified in very
unusual terms that this area would be removed to a new super department.  The whole episode left me feeling rather orphaned. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">If it wasn’t a good day for me, it was an interesting
one for Oli.  This week she has been
shooting stories for the next programme she is preparing for Mi Cámara y Yo
which will be about tourism in Madrid.  Wednesday
saw her with a group of retired British tourists visiting Chinchón, a pretty village
outside Madrid.  She sent a selfie with
them  to greet me. It made me laugh.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

He is just so good looking.  18
year old Arshad Khan, a tea seller (chai wala) at a bazar in Islamabad was
photographed by Javeria Ali, a young photographer who loves to capture human
life. When she saw Arshad pouring the tea she was struck by how good looking he
was and posted her picture on Instagram.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">He looks a lot more attractive in his work shirt than
he does as a model, don’t you think? The Chai Wala who previously earned 60
euros a month for selling tea will now see his earnings rise astronomically and
he and his big family saved from poverty and all because of his blue eyes and
this wonderful picture.  The power of
internet is amazing.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Thursday was a long and tiring day for me.  I had an intense day which started before
sunrise and ended long after sunset.  It
was spent mostly in a hotel room in the centre of Madrid and was focused on the
integration of the two, or rather three companies, as the small operator Pepephone
had also been acquired.  As usual the
majority of the attendants were men. 
There was a lot of energy at the beginning of the day but as the time
passed it waned.  You can only take in so
much information in a few hours, when they drag on your attention span drops
but the organisers were a consultancy and I think they have never learned the
basics of how to capture an audience’s attention when a meeting goes on for so
long.  The best thing about the day was
getting to know so many new colleagues.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

sensitive to wind.  I remember bringing
one over from the UK to Málaga many years ago for a Motorola event.  Due to wind, wind which as person standing
outside you would probably not even notice, it never took off and had to be
tethered. I have never used one ever again in an event. Luckily Ol’s did take
off although they had to wait from 7 to 11 in the morning for the balloon to
fly. Here she is with the Japs</span><span style="font-family: &quot;wingdings&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">:-)</span></div>

The next day we were sending out a press release on Yoigo’s earnings for
the third quarter of the year.  These
earnings were still under the ownership of the Swedes and would be our last
results with the company.  The press
release needed lots of fine tuning until it was ready to be released on Friday
morning at 7.15 am.  Yes, the Swedes do
things early hahaha.  Thankfully I was up
early as usual and the release went like clockwork. The best thing is that the
results were good and earnings had risen.  We got lots of articles like </span><a href="http://www.eleconomista.es/economia/noticias/7906314/10/16/Economia-Empresas-Ampl-Yoigo-aumenta-un-36-sus-ventas-hasta-septiembre.html" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">this one from El Economista.</a></div>

<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The group photo was a bit of a disaster. Not everyone was there and I had to go and find Eladio to get him to join.  However when I found him the shoot was over. I only got a shot of when the group started getting together hahaha. Note my mother-in-law aged 94 who is at the front.  She had a grand time. She always loves family gatherings.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">We didn't leave until nearly 7pm.  I guess the drinking and dancing would go on much later but we had to go as we had left Pippa stuck in the house since 12 that morning.  She was delighted to see us and I felt guilty for having left her behind. If Spain was a more dog friendly country she could have come with us.  </span></div>
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">We were all tired and were soon in our pyjamas; well, Oli, MIguel and I were, and it was time for dinner.  No one was very hungry so I just made a simple meal of salad and scrambled eggs. Needless to say my dinner was more bl**** vegetables. This diet is so so hard.  </span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Netflix was the evening entertainment. We watched a rather violent film called Olympus has Fallen about an attack on the White House until it was time to go to bed.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">And today is Sunday and it is still dark outside.  It will be even darker next Sunday when the clocks go back. It is raining again and I can only imagine we shall go for a long and wet walk. Yesterday, unfortunately, there was no time for one.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">We shall be leaving Montrondo after lunch and tomorrow will be back to routine and work.  </span></div>
