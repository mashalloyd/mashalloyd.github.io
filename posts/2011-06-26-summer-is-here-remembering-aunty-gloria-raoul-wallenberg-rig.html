We then have dinner earlier at just after eight and only then, as the sun is going down, can we dare out on our walk.

We then go to our room where we have previously set the air conditioning to cool it before we arrive and watch the television on our huge screen until we fall asleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That is the way we combat the heat; there is no other way.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The week has been busy after our trip to Brussels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I have been occupied with preparations for this year’s Yoigo summer party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was going to be in Ibiza but now is in Madrid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I have, however, not abandoned the Ibiza theme as we will all be going dressed in white and will set up our own “Pacha” discotheque.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

Inés, a journalist I knew well in my Nokia days, did a great job understanding Yoigo’s role in the so-called “price war” in Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You can read it <a href="http://www.cincodias.com/articulo/empresas/guerra-precios-movil-acaba-empezar-tarifas-van-bajar/20110621cdscdsemp_22">here</a>.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Soon the Video crew arrived at my home ready to film the stereotype of a day in the life of a Spanish communications director (get up early, say goodbye to small children, hit the traffic, arrive at the office, talk to their secretary about the day’s meetings, meetings, arrive home late at night, say goodnight to children, etc, etc) only to realize that my days are quite the opposite as I mostly work at home, do not have small children, nor a secretary and organize my own time and that above all I do not distinguish between my personal and my professional life. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I look forward to the finished product which will be shown at the up and coming annual convention.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I will not be attending unfortunately as I would love to see my counterparts’ reactions to my very different sort of day to theirs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The crew filmed me reading the papers and talking on the phone in the kitchen, in the garden with Norah, working at my desk in our study, showing them my books and talking to Oli by the pool where she was working and finally pretending to have to run off to a late night meeting after an urgent phone call.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Unfortunately when they were filming that part I realized Eladio had taken my car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I tried to ring him but he had left his phone at home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Even worse, I really did have to run off to the office after the filming for a meeting with the sales department about social media and had no car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thankfully Suzy drove me to the nearby shopping centre where Eladio and my Father were doing the weekly shopping.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>After a short telling off, I grabbed my car from Eladio and rushed to the office.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thankfully I wasn’t late as I hate not being on time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Punctuality is a trait in me I have cultivated over the years.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Wednesday night I went to do the tasting for the dinner and took along Eladio and his brother José Antonio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They are no great food connoisseurs, so it was up to me to decide what was good, what was bad and what needed changing, as they, of course, thought everything was ok. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>In the end I changed absolutely everything and we will have to go back tomorrow night for another evening of tasting – not good for my new Dukan figure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The location we have chosen is perfect for an Ibizan party. It’s called <a href="http://www.lagunasdelasmadres.com/">Las Lagunas de las madres</a> and is a natural park with two lakes, so we will be able to do everything outside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But more about the party next week when it’s over and I can reveal all the surprise activities being prepared for the occasion.<o:p></o:p></span></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

My book of the week is once again about the Second World War, a genre that fascinates me as I was brought up on my own parents’ stories of the war. Even as a child I used to have nightmares about Nazi soldiers coming to our house in the middle of the night to arrest us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was born in 1957, just 12 years after it finished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>As I read survivors’ stories it saddens me to know that soon there will be no eye witnesses left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Their great legacy however are the thousands of biographies written by many and which never tire me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This week I devoured <a href="http://alexkershaw.com/">Alex Kershaw’s</a> “<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Save-People-Alex-Kershaw/dp/0091931282">To savea people</a>” about the Swedish diplomat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Wallenberg">Raoul Wallenberg</a> who saved many jews lives in Hungary in the last year of the war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Raoul Wallenberg has earned the title of “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Righteous_among_the_Nations">Righteous among nations</a>” and deservedly so. This is an honorific title used by Israel to describe non-jews who risked their lives during the Holocaust to save Jews from extermination by the Nazis. He saved anything between 20.000 and 100.000 by issuing them protective passes from the Swedish Embassy and placing them in Swedish Embassy property specially bought for this purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>When the Russians arrived in 1945, he was deported for questioning and was supposedly killed there in 1947.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The end of his life continues to be a mystery and his parents and family never ceased to try and find him, often with total opposition from the Swedish government who always feared a conflict with Russia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>However Wallenberg lives on as a "Righteous among nations" in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yad_Vashem">YadVashem Holocaust museum</a> in Jerusalem which we visited last year and around the world in many other memorials.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So moved was I by the book that I have since ordered some of the biographies mentioned in Alex Kershaw’s bibliography by some of the Jews that Wallenberg helped to survive. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</div><div style="text-align: justify;">  <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">In the appendix I read a quote by David Ben Gurion, the ex Prime Minister of Israel where he asks why the people of the countries where the Jews were persecuted did not do more to help.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In essence he wonders if they had been English, French, American or Russian whether the world would have acted in the same way. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I ask myself the same question. I think they would have reacted differently, they would have done more but I don’t understand why. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>But I do know that Raoul Wallenberg was one of those people who never thought about race, only about the human race when he risked his life to save so many Jews and in the end died for his efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; tab-stops: 113.95pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On a lighter note the weekend has been quiet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>On Saturday I went with Oli to the market in Majadahonda, one of the best in Madrid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We hadn’t been for a long time and it was busy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I went looking for Menorcan sandals for Eladio but they only had them for women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Of course I bought a pair for myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I also got a great summer dress for 15 euros which is perfect for these hot summer days.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>
