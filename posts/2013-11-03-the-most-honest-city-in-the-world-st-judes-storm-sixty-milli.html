<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It was on
Sunday that I read a piece of news that fascinated me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was a <a href="http://www.rd.com/slideshows/most-honest-cities-lost-wallet-test/#ixzz2gO9yN0RJ">study</a> made by the Reader’s Digest to
find the most honest city in the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>They had dropped 192 wallets in 16 cities around the world to see how
people would react.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Each wallet
contained 50 dollars, a telephone number, a family photo, coupons and business
cards. I was not surprised to read that Helsinki is the most honest city when 11
out of 12 wallets were returned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In
Mumbai 9 out of 12 were returned, in Budapest and New York 8 out of 12, in
Moscow and Amsterdam 7 out of 12, in London and Slovenia 5 out of 12, in
Bucharest, Rio and Zurich (!) 4 out of 12, in Prague 3, in Madrid 2 and in
Lisbon 1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So Lisbon is the most
dishonest city in the world from this study where only 1 person returned the
wallet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Funnily enough it was a Dutch
couple who returned it there.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Monday
Londoners and people in Wales and the South of England woke up in the wake of a
very strong <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/weather/10407815/Weather-St-Judes-UK-storm-live.html">storm</a> baptized St. Jude, the patron saint of lost causes which was
on Monday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>5 people died and a lot of
destruction was caused by the winds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>People were left without electricity, public transport was called to a
halt and the whole of the country was prepared for much worse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In the end some called it a storm in a tea
cup, but if people were killed because of it, I think it was more than
that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Suzy sent me this photo a friend
of hers had seen of a tree falling on a car near where they live.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The news in
Spain that day was that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24699733">60 million phones had been monitored </a>in just one month by
the NSA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This came after the story of
Angela Merkel’s Nokia phone having been bugged by the same organization as had
phones of some 35 world leaders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We are
in the midst of the news which has been leaked by the very brave Edward Snowden
now in exile in Russia, who worked for the NSA and has since let the world know
that the Americans are listening in to the rest of the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was asked by Spanish journalists what an
operator’s responsibility in this case is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>We have to safeguard our customer’s conversations and we encrypt the
systems, but no system in the world is free of espionage I am afraid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Most of us suspect all our governments were
and are in the know and it is thanks to Snowden that we are all now aware to
what extent this practice takes place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

most interested in that day though was our own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Yoigo announced it now has 4G coverage in Barcelona, Alicante and Seville,
in addition to Valencia, Málaga and Madrid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>By the end of the year we aim to have 4G coverage in all towns with over
70.000 inhabitants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>A colleague of mine
did a speed test that morning in Barcelona and the result was spectacular as
you can see in the photo below.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The family
news that day was that I bought Suzy’s air ticket for when she comes home for
Christmas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She will be coming on 22<sup>nd</sup>
December and leaving on the 29<sup>th</sup> – in time to spend New Year’s Eve

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Not so long
ago I was astonished to read that my beloved Yorkshire had been the winner of
this year’s Travel Awards as best place to visit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Well on Tuesday this week it went up a notch
to become one of the top regions in the world. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, which is sometimes
called God’s own country, was voted the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/oct/29/yorkshire-third-best-region-in-the-world-2014-lonely-planet">third best region in the world</a> in the Lonely
Planet’s 2014 best in travel list.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was
so proud that my beloved Yorkshire had got this recognition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I am told it has become a “cool” place to
visit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I do hope that doesn’t mean there
will be hordes of tourists now at some of my favourite destinations such as
Bolton Abbey, the Strid wood, Skipton, the Dales, Harrogate or the moors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I also hope that doesn’t mean the price of
property will go up as I don’t rule out buying a cottage to spend part of our
time in some idyllic Dales village one day when we retire. In case you are
wondering what the top ten regions are, this is the list: 1) Sikkim, India, 2) The
Kimberley, Australia, 3) Yorkshire, UK, 4) Hokuriku, Japan, 5) Texas, USA, 6)
Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe and Zambia, 7) Mallorca, Spain, 8) West Coast, New
Zealand, 9) Hunan, China, 10) Ha’apai, Tonga.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I can only imagine villagers from the remote parts of Yorkshire reading
the news in the local papers and saying “oh by gum”. In fact I felt like saying
it myself when I read it and wondered if it meant there may be a narrowing of
the famous north south divide ……</span><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN;"></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I didn’t talk
about Yorkshire at lunch that day which was with a journalist, Pilar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But of course we did talk about the NSA
listening to the world’s conversations and reading our emails and postings on
social media.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We had lunch at a

Gloria and Miguel from my events agency, QuintaEsencia, when we visited the
location for a show cooking event I will be holding next week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The communications team from TeliaSonera
Mobility Services, our mother company, will be meeting in Madrid and one of the
things we will be doing is learning how to cook Spanish food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I do hope the evening goes well at <a href="http://fuentesybonetillo.com/">Fuentes yBonetillo</a>.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Wednesday,
my second fasting day of the week, there was finally some good news about Spain
in the “foreign” press.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24740721">BBC reported</a>
that Spain had ended a two year recession with 0.1% growth in the last
quarter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We have also read reports that
Bill Gates has invested in Spain recently, so that must be a good sign.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I do hope it at least means the beginning of
the end of the recession we are all fed up with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I went for an
early walk that day, so as to be free to greet our guests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That day, my cousin Ziuka (born in France of
Russian descent but living in England) and her Mother, my Aunty Valya were
visiting us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Ziuka is the daughter of my
Mother’s beloved younger brother Nicholas (Dydya Kola to me) and she hadn’t
seen my Father since he left England in 2005.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>My Father and Aunty Valya are the two surviving spouses of my Mother
Elena and her 5 brothers and sisters. I hadn’t seen my Tyatya Valya (Nichola’s
wife) who lives in Paris, since 1999 at my Mother’s funeral so this was to be
quite a reunion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They are important to
me of course, but you have to understand that as I hardly have any family left
apart from my Father, their visit was going to be a big event.</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: Arial;"></span> </div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">They were driving from Biarritz and would be
reaching us in the early evening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Ziuka’s
sat nav played a trick and left her some 12km from here on the wrong street, so
off I went in my car and tried to find it with my sat nav which finally I
did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was lovely to see them and to
see how well my 88 year old Russian born Aunt is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I observed at dinner how she smokes and
drinks wine, is very mobile and leads a full life and I thought she is the
perfect role model for me!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>To me she
seems eternal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We enjoyed a great family
dinner and Olivia joined us later which of course brought down the average age
around the table.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">From the
Puerta del Sol we walked to the Plaza Mayor where we sat and enjoyed a drink in
the sun and continued talking to catch up on so many years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>From the Plaza Mayor I took them to the Arco
de los Cuchilleros and down the steps to the surrounding streets where we
walked past Botín, the oldest restaurant in Madrid and to our destination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We were to have lunch at <a href="http://www.casapaco1933.com/">Casa Paca</a> which I
think they enjoyed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">After lunch,
we made our way to Atocha to a Russian shop called "<a href="http://www.casapaco1933.com/">Tienda Bravo</a>" which I had heard existed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We took a while to find it and were delighted
to see it was open although it was not yet 17h, the afternoon opening time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Here we bought pelmeni (Russian ravioli), Smetana
(sour cream) to go with them and other typical Russian products such as
halva.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Aunty Valya got a compliment from
a Russian girl shopping there who commented her on her beautiful and probably
pre revolutionary Russian.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I knew from
my Mother that “soviets” apparently do not speak it so well.</span></div>

meat (muslim) for our live in home help Fátima who worried me because she eats

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Armed with our
purchases of Russian and Muslim food, we made our way home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Here Valya was able to take a little siesta
followed by countless cups of tea and Ziuka was able to wind down by playing
candy crush. Meanwhile Eladio and I went on our daily walk with the dogs.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">After the walk
I took Fátima to the doctor as the laboratory had rung the day before to say
that in the results of her analysis which I had taken her to do on Tuesday, her
hemaglobin was dangerously low. We immediately thought she must be anemic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The doctor who had the results was very
alarmed and nearly sent her to hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>That would have been a huge problem as she is not yet legal and does not
yet have a health card.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In the end,
after much questioning it turned out she is lacking in iron and her low blood
count is due to a loss of a lot of blood through her monthlies and a lack of
correct eating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She has now been put on
a protein and iron diet with supplements of course and from Thursday evening
every meal has to contain protein and iron as well as vegetables and fruit and
lots of milk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I also think a main cause
could have been the very damaging effects of Ramadan in August.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Fátima was very upset and I must tell you I
feel like her Mother and am looking after her as if she was my daughter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She admitted to me that her children don’t
eat well either, that they don’t drink milk and often eat just pasta and tomato
sauce.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was so alarmed that when we
went shopping this week I purchased a suitcase full of food for her to take
home, full of the food her children need: milk, eggs, sardines, tuna fish,
lentils, fruit and vegetables.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I cannot
help the rest of the world but I can at least help her and her family and I
intend to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Finally this morning,
when she left, there was a slight colour of pink in her normally very yellow
skin. I dread to think how many other poor people affected by the crisis must
also be suffering from anemia.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Dinner that
night was Russian and Spanish food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
had made “perushki” (little meat pies), followed by croquettes for our visitors
which I knew they would appreciate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I do
wish Fátima could have eaten the perushki but part of her problem is that she
cannot eat the same meat as ours as it has to be halal. Well now she has halal
meat thank goodness.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Thursday
night, after the trip to Madrid, the walk and the doctor episode I was looking
forward to a hot shower after dinner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
got into the shower but only cold water came out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We then realised that neither the central
heating nor the hot water worked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The
problem was that we would have to wait until Monday to get it mended as Friday
was a bank holiday and at the weekend the plumber who had apparently put our
central heating in order recently for the neat sum of 250 euros, wouldn’t be
available until Monday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So we just had
to grit our teeth and wear warm clothes. Thankfully the weather was pretty
benign. In fact it was sunny throughout the stay of Ziuka and Aunty Valya.</span></div>

Spain. On Friday Eladio joined us and we took Ziuka and Aunty Valya to visit
the Valley of the Fallen (El Valle de los </span>aídos), the
monument to fascism that mourns the nationalists (those on the side of Franco)
who lost their lives in the Civil War.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The
amazing cathedral built into a rock and huge cross above it which is visible
for miles, were built by the republican prisoners (the enemies of Franco), many
of who died in the attempt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was
started in 1940 just after the bloody war and finished in 1959.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The photo illustrating this week’s blog post
is of me with Ziuka and my Aunt outside the Basílica.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Here Franco is buried and not surprisingly his
is a very austere tombstone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>For the
records, this was a purely cultural visit as I am no fan of Franco in case you
wondered.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">After the
visit, we made our way to the nearby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Escorial,_Madrid">El Escorial</a>, that pretty little village in
the mountains some 60km from Madrid where Philip II built his austere palace
more commonly known as the Monastery of El Escorial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We drove around the huge building before

in the early evening to rest and then to do the weekly shopping which I always
do with Fátima.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Ziuka and Aunty Valya
joined us and I soon realised that the shops were closed as it was a national
holiday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So we decided to have a cup of
coffee and I think all four of us enjoyed the outing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I later realised we were talking a mixture of
French, English and Spanish, just as we did throughout their visit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I could add to that Russian of course.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">That evening I
made pelmeni for dinner, our overall favourite Russian food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This is the photo of Ziuka’s plate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>When I posted it on Facebook a Spanish friend
commented that I do like funny food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Little does she know that pelmeni are not funny.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>My mother used to make them beautifully and
the dish brings back so many wonderful memories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The first time and only time I went to Russia
(St. Petersburg in 2005) that was what I ordered at the restaurant on our first night there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Today you can buy them frozen at Russian
shops and they are nearly as good as my Mother’s.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Saturday
morning after another leisurely breakfast with my French/Russian family and after
another lovely coffee and chat with Ziuka by the pool, they had to leave.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We all went outside to say goodbye and wave
them off in their Peugeot 405 with a British registration plate. I do hope they

have loved to have stayed for lunch that day when we had pelmeni again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But we also had “borsch” (Russian beetroot, meat
and vegetable stew).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had asked Zena,
my ex Ukranian cleaner, to make some for us and Fátima and I picked it up at my
friend’s house, also called Fátima, where she cleans now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I paid her handsomely for her job and we all
enjoyed the proper Russian meal yesterday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>We were joined by Olivia and Miguel who of course was trying Russian
food for the first time in his life. For the record we had my freshly homemade
apple crumble afterwards.</span></div>

morning, Sunday, we woke up to no water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Now we had neither central heating, nor hot nor cold water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I thought that if Murphy’s law ruled, soon we
would have no electricity but thankfully that didn’t happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>As I commented to Miguel, I could do without
all of them so long as internet worked</span><span style="font-family: Wingdings; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-ascii-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-char-type: symbol; mso-hansi-font-family: Arial; mso-symbol-font-family: Wingdings;"><span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Wingdings;">J</span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">
Life continued without water and I took Fátima to the bus stop with her huge
suitcase of food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Once there I popped
into the local shop and bought 12 litres of water as we had been told we might
not have water all day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Then I bought
some churros (Spanish breakfast fritters), porras (a bigger version) and thick
chocolate for Oli and Miguel’s breakfast. After all it would be their last but
one breakfast with us for three weeks as they are going on holiday tomorrow  to Indonesia. They will be visiting Bali, Java and the Gili
islands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

with them to their local gym.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They were
going to swim but I was going to use the installations for a modest fee of 5
euros to be able to have a luxurious shower and wash my hair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Lunch today was all together and we all
enjoyed Fátima’s homemade pizza.</span></div>
