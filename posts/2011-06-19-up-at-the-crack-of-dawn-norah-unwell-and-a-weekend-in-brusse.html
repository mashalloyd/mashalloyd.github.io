Norah, our wonderful and naughty beagle dog, was born with a malformation in her spine (the end of one vertebra in her neck (axis) nearly touches the other – excuse the lack of a more scientific explanation). This has given her two episodes of severe neck and back pain twice before and on Monday it was quite evident that she was going through another one as when I got up early in the morning, I found her on her mat unable to get up or move.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She cried when I stroked her and I had to feed her from my hand. We took her to the vet where they gave her an x-ray and all we could see was the malformation we already knew about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I suppose it must be a bit similar to a slipped disk and is very painful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>All the vet could do was to prescribe anti inflammatory tablets and lots of rest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Dear little Norah behaved beautifully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Well of course, she wasn’t her usual self.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

It was quite a shock but of course we were expecting it. Olivia came to pick us up (a first for the record) and we were home just before four and happy to see everyone again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was especially happy to see Norah nearly recovered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The girls have had a great weekend here enjoying the sun by the pool with their friends Juli and Rocío. I imagine my Father will be “weathering” the heat as best he can.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We brought him some superb Belgian biscuits as he is the only one in the house who does not have to look after his figure and of course he has a very sweet tooth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></div><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">So now I will hasten to upload what I have written, include the links and upload the photos and publish this, after which I will join the girls by the pool.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><o:p></o:p></span><br></br>
