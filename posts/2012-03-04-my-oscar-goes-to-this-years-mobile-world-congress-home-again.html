<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Hello
everyone,</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">It’s Sunday
again, another week has gone by and it’s nearly spring.  My week has been great but exhausting and I am
still feeling tired after this year’s participation in the biggest mobile fair
in the world, a sort of huge circus that takes place every year in Barcelona,
the <a href="http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/index.html">Mobile World congress</a>. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">This time last
Sunday I was on the high speed train to Barcelona, along with many other
Spanish participants, including my best friend Fátima with whom I worked both
in Motorola and Nokia.  That night, while
we were having dinner at one of my favourite places, El Merendero de la Mari in
the Port Vell, this year’s Oscars were being awarded.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">And the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16700124">Oscar</a>
for best actress went to Meryl Streep, as most people had predicted, for her
magnificent role as Margaret Thatcher in “The Iron Lady”.  I was pleased for her as I always am for
women stars in their 50’s and 60’s.  They
all look so good these days and are a sort of role model for me, to keep on
looking good. I had lots of compliments this year in Barcelona for my new
figure and looks where a lot of thanks are due to Dr. Dukan but also to my other
role models, my beautiful young daughters. I for one, hope to look as good as
Meryl Streep when I reach 62.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">As also
predicted The Artist, that funny French silent film in black and white, won 5
of the top Oscars.  Hugo, by Martin Scorsese,
won another 5.  One film which didn’t win
an Oscar but had many nominations was <a href="http://www.warhorsemovie.com/">War Horse</a> by Steven Spielberg.  I went to see it with Eladio on Friday and
loved every minute of it, but then I am a sucker for animals and war films.  You could call it “cheesy” but then I love
sentimental cheesy films.  It was a
wonderful creation, the story of a beautiful horse called Joey, set in Devon in
England and its adventures in the cruel World War I.  It now belongs to my top ten films, the type
you can watch over and over again.  So,
my Oscar this year goes to Joey and his wonderful young owner Albert, played by
the young English actor, Jeremy Irvine, in this epic film by Steven Spielberg.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I have
digressed writing about the Oscars and should tell you about Sunday, our first
and most relaxing day spent in Barcelona last week.  Upon arrival at the train station we took a
taxi to our hotel, the <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/bcndm-diplomatic-hotel-barcelona/">Diplomatic</a> where all the TeliaSonera delegates had a
room.  The hotel is run of the mill but
fine, the sort of hotel which could be anywhere in the world. Its salient
feature is that it’s very central, on Pau Claris,  a stone’s throw from the Paseo de Gracia
street, possibly Barcelona’s most elegant thoroughfare where all the best shops
can be found and some wonderful buildings such as Gaudi’s Casa Battlo and Casa
Mila, the city’s most well known architectural gems. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">As soon as we
had settled in, unpacked and connected our pcs to internet (via my modem as the
hotel’s wifi signal was very weak), we took a taxi to Port Vell (old port) to
the area by Pau Villa where there are a string of wonderful open air
restaurants.  The sun was shining and the
place was bustling with people, both local, as well as tourists and many
delegates from the Mobile World Congress (MWC). 
Thus we didn’t get a table at <a href="http://www.calpinxo.com/es/index.html">Cal Pinxo</a> until well past 15.30 but we didn’t mind as
time that day was not a constraint.  We
had the first of the three fidueas I was to consume during my stay.  It’s a dish very similar to paella but made
with thin noodles and boy is it good.  </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">To work off
the wonderful lunch, we decided to walk to the Fira to register for our MWC
badges.  The crowds grew thinner as
walked our way up the Paralelo Avenue and were amazed to see that we took
nearly an hour and a half to do so.  Just
as we reached the Plaza de España where the Fira is located we came upon the
huge Yoigo building poster featuring my phone, the excellent Samsung Galaxy S2,
so we had to stop here for a photo session to mark the happy moment.  My mind took me back to the first time I came
to the MWC with Yoigo, 5 years ago when we were just starting and were a very
small player in the market.  Who could
have predicted then that just 5 years later we would be a profitable company
with over 3 million customers?  The huge
poster made me smile at the success story of the great little fighting brand
operator I am proud to work for.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">We took a taxi
back to our hotel and spent the rest of the afternoon working.  Later I joined my other TeliaSonera
colleagues at the traditional get together which took place this year at Taller
de Tapas.  However I didn’t stay for
dinner as that would have meant leaving Fátima all on her own.  So as I said earlier, we had dinner at <a href="http://www.merenderodelamari.com/">El Merendero de la Marí</a>, right next to Cal Pinxo. 
We were in bed early as we would both be in need of a good night’s sleep
to face the busy few days coming up. 
Fátima was staying in my room as she had been unable to find
accommodation until Tuesday night.  It
was great to be together again and reminded us of our cycling tour days when
Motorola had a team, starring none less than the Tour de France winner, Lance
Armstrong.  However I was not to get much
sleep thanks to my friend’s very heavy snoring. 
I am a very light sleeper anyway and any noise, however slight, will
keep me awake so the nights were torturous, despite the foam ear plugs I had
brought with me.  The next day I bought
some wax ones which worked slightly better. 
But it wasn’t until Tuesday night that I got some decent slumber. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Monday morning
was spent working from our room.  Well
not quite.  At one stage I took the
opportunity to get a hair do as well as the luxury of having my nails painted,
red, of course, after which I ventured into my favourite shop Zara where I
bought two lovely jackets, one white and one pink.  It was very warm in Barcelona and the clothes
I had brought were far too wintery.  Any
excuse will do for shopping in Zara is the actual truth!</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Every time I
bumped into acquaintances or friends they often remarked how busy I must
be.  In actual fact that wasn’t true as
most of the work had already been done before getting to Barcelona and in a way
I was there just to see it executed.  The
activities I had prepared were multiple. 
First we had a blogger group hosted by Yoigo and accompanied by my team
from our PR Agency, Ketchum, then we had a Carnaval party organized for the bloggers
and Yoigo shop owners on the Tuesday and lastly on the Wednesday, we were to
celebrate our annual press conference, possibly our most important media event
of the year. As all the work was done, previous to coming, I was able to
relax and just see the activities roll out to perfection, thanks to good
organization and two wonderful teams of people from our PR Agency, Ketchum and
my events agency QuintaEsencia.  </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">For me the
Mobile World Congress is all about meeting old and new colleagues and Monday
lunch was a highlight as I had a date with Keka, a colleague from Nokia who I
first got to know when she started as a very young trainee and I was able to
help her in her beginnings.  Being a very
clever and pretty girl, Keka went on to shine professionally when she went to
live in Finland and then London.  After
leaving Nokia she had a stint in Nepal and India, countries that have left a
mark on her and today she is living quietly in her native Santiago as a writer,
author and coach.  It was great to see
her again after so much time and catch up on our lives over another wonderful
fideua again at El Merendero de la Mari.</span></div>

professional parties but this time it was different.  I enjoyed the whole evening, talking and
mixing with shop owners, bloggers, colleagues and contacts from some of our
suppliers, as well as friends like Keka and also my dear Turkish engineer
friend Berk whom I once dreamed would marry my daughters. But that was not to
be. You can see what a great party it was if you <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/57521609@N04/6797532468/in/photostream/">click on this link </a>to see the

from Nokia who today is head of external communication with TeliaSonera.  Isn’t the world a small place?  I felt sorry for my TeliaSonera
communications colleagues who fell foul to a breakdown in electricity and thus
the whole press conference had to take place without the use of microphones or
power points.  If that had happened to
me, I would have “died” but the Swedes seemed to take the whole situation quite
philosophically. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Because of the
lack of electricity the press conference was cut very short and I was able to
get away to have lunch with my two best friends and ex colleagues, Julio and
Fátima.  This was to be my last fideua at
Cal Pinxo.  If you are worried about my
weight, don’t be as I am back into the Dukan diet fold this week hahahaha.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">It was on
Tuesday when I got to see some of the fair. 
In the morning I made a beeline for what feels like home when I’m at the
MWC, the Nokia Siemens Networks hall. 
Here I greeted old colleagues like Antonio, Julio, Pentti, Paloma and
dear Emilio B.  It’s always great to see
them.  In the afternoon I visited the
Nokia stand and was happy to see they were back at the fair after a few years
absence.  Here I greeted Kaisa, Solange,
Kristina, Mark, Claire, Xavier, Anna, Ben and it was lovely to see them and
catch up on how things are today in communications at Nokia.  But it was even lovelier to bump into Jesús
S, my dearest colleague at Motorola who now lives in Miami. Fittingly my dearest
colleague from Nokia, Julio, took this lovely photo of us both. Jesús who turned
50 this year, remarked that when he first joined Motorola he was just 29.  Wow that takes me back a while.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">As to the fair
itself, at the beginning of this week’s post, I referred to it as a sort of
giant circus and that is literally what it is. 
Some 60.000 delegates attended this year and goodness knows how many
firms, some known some not.  The noise
around the fair and the bustle are at times a little too much.  I think what most caught my attention was the
Pegasus horse made of mobile phones.  If
you looked closer you could see it was made by the Chinese manufacturer Huawei
and it is really a work of art.  I had my
picture taken with Pablo X who heads up sales at Huawei Spain and is
Chinese.  I think it was the most
photographed thing at the fair.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Most delegates,
and they were from all over the world, with many representatives from Asia,
were busy snapping at all the tablets and mobile phones on display.  As you can imagine, the latter don’t really
seduce me after so many years in the sector. 
What I thought worth photographing were other things, such as the
enormous taxi queues, a Japanese lady dressed in a kimono, promoting her
restaurant in town, anti capitalist demonstrators, a bit like at Davos, a woman
shouting against the use of coltan in mobile phones and funniest of all, two
elderly gentlemen offering accommodation in far away Sitges for 150 euros per “nigth”
as they spelled it. It seems there are enormous parallel activities trying to
cash in on the well off delegates.  They were a sight to see and hear.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Tuesday was
all about meeting people; thanks to Julio I even met the General Manager of
Google Spain who has the same name as Spain’s last President, José Luis
Rodriguez Zapatero and causes havoc when he makes a restaurant
reservation.  It was also full of social
events.  At 18h I had an appointment at
the huge Ericsson hall where I was to meet up with our bloggers before the
annual party started.  Here I met three
charming Indians from Kerala who now live in Stockholm working for Ericsson.  They have developed communication via the
human body and showed me how when they took a photo of me with a phone, just by
my touching the back of it, the picture showed up on a screen behind us.  That was mind blowing and I was delighted it
had been invented by the three delightful Indians whom I told I loved their country and
remembered to say “Namaste”. I’m not sure whether they thought I was mad as a
hatter. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">A little later
I escaped from the party and left the Swedes and their colleagues beginning
dinner at the unearthly hour of just past 18h, to get ready for a private
dinner I had arranged for my team from Ketchum, QuintaEsencia and other Yoigo
colleagues at the more reasonable time of 21h (no one has dinner earlier in spain).  We had the most delicious
dinner at <a href="http://www.restaurantelaventa.com/eo/">La Venta </a>at the top of Barcelona in an area called Tibidabo at what
turned out to be the most enjoyable and relaxing event of the week, so much so
that I even forgot to take any photographs.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">On Tuesday
night I got my best night’s sleep as Fátima had left, so I was up feeling fresh
and full of energy the next morning which was good as our press conference was
taking place at 10.  It was great to
arrive just after 9.30 to find everything ready and beautifully prepared by my
teams from Ketchum and QuintaEsencia.  We
held it at lovely bar called <a href="http://www.grupotragaluz.com/rest-mordisco.php">Mordisco</a> and the setting was perfect; a lovely
glass roofed room with a table in the middle heavily laid with fabulous fruit
and other breakfast delicacies.  </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Soon the place
was heaving with colleagues, bloggers and journalists.  Thankfully the turnout was excellent with
some 35 representatives from the media.  If
you consider the size of the fair and the amount of information shared by all
the exhibitors, we were lucky to get our own share of voice in the middle of
such bedlam.  That day we were announcing
our objectives for 2012, some great new flat tariffs, but the most important
news was the launch of a mobile voice over IP voucher.  For just 6 euros a month our customers will
be able to use applications like skype or viber on their mobile phones, for the
equivalent of 1 cent per minute, a bit of a revolution in the sector and
something very new for Spain.  I was very
pleased to follow the online coverage after the event which continued through
the day and offline the next day.  As we
are very innovative in Yoigo we also tweeted and posted the news on Twitter and
Facebook (and on Google+ and Tuenti) during the conference itself and as we did
it I thought just how the way I communicate has changed since I first started
in the trade.  Everything these days is
fast and immediate.</span></div>

<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Our
journalists hung around for an hour or so after the press conference, talking
to us and writing the news and enjoying the food.  In a way it was a bit like a party.  Something happened on Wednesday that has
never happened before; the journalists and bloggers actually clapped when the
conference finished.  I think they enjoy
themselves thoroughly when they are with us. 
Why ever they did it, it felt good.</span></div>

<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Soon I was
rushing back to my hotel to pick up my three pieces of luggage to take a taxi
to catch the 13h high speed train back to Madrid.  As on the outbound journey, I coincided with
many colleagues and other familiar faces on the way back.  I spent most of the journey working, sending
out the releases to the staff, uploading photos, replying to emails and the
2.45h trip went past in a flash. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I was home
just after 16h where I was greeted by Eladio, Suzy and my Father.  Very soon I was off with Suzy to see her new
flat in nearby Villanueva de la Cañada. She and Gaby will be living in a very
modern block of flats built specially for young people and subsidized by the
local authorities.  They reminded me of
student accommodation in the UK, the difference being that these colourful Lacasito
(name for the equivalent of smarties in Spain) flats are spotlessly clean and
have all the latest finishings.  </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The flats are
small but cosy and have lots of light because of their enormous
windows.  They have a kitchen come
lounge, one tiny bedroom, one larger bedroom and luxury of luxuries, two
bathrooms, as well as lots of cupboard space. 
They are not furnished so Suzy and Gaby probably won’t be moving in
until the beginning of May as they need to get all sorts of things before they
finally make the move.  I can feel from
Susana that she is very excited about going to live in the new flat but at the
same time a little sad about leaving home. 
I think we all share the same feeling.

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The next day,
Thursday, I had to go to the office for an important meeting which kept being
rescheduled to 30 minutes later which meant I missed lunch at home.  Thankfully though I was able to go for a walk
with Eladio, the only one this week unfortunately, unless you count last Sunday
with Fátima in Barcelona.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">On Friday I
was finally able to relax.  I went food
shopping with Eladio in the morning and then I had another lunch date. But it
wasn’t any lunch date, it was a goodbye lunch for Gustavo.  Gustavo has worked for me as the head of the
PR team at Ketchum since the summer of 2006 since when he has grown
professionally into the best PR executive you could ever dream of if you are a
Communications Director like me.  He is
leaving to work for another agency where he will head up the account for a big
car manufacturer and I don’t think he knows just how much I will miss him.  He is not only a good professional but a
lovely dependable and reliable person who never loses his nerve whatever the situation
is.  So he deserved the best kind of send
off we could give him.  With the help of
the girls from QuintaEsencia and Carlos from Ketchum, we devised a lovely
goodbye kit and an album of photos of his times on the Yoigo account.  </span></div>

great place called El Bogavante de Almirante (lobster joint) and one of my
surprises was a pack of party poppers. 
Needless to say the table looked a picture at the end of the lunch.  Luckily Carlos will take Gustavo’s place and
Isabel too will continue to work on the account.  Of course, they will miss him too.  But as he said in a lovely message he sent to
me afterwards, he will miss me as a customer but has gained me as a friend.  I too have gained a friend.  Farewell Gustavo, I wish you all the luck in
the world in the next step of your career.

finish until past 5 and I had to be home on time to go to the cinema with
Eladio to see War Horse which was starting at 7pm.  Because of an accident on the way home, I had
to take another way and ended up getting lost. 
Thus I was home a little late and we got to the cinema just as the
wonderful epic film was starting. 
Afterwards we went to dinner to Fosters Hollywood, as our favourite, La
Alpargatería has closed down.  It’s a
poor substitute I must say.</span><br></br>

where I came home exhausted.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">So, yes the

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">It has also
been the week I discovered a star, a 10 year old girl called <a href="http://www.jackieevancho.com/us">Jackie Evancho</a> who
sings like an angel.  Whilst we were
listening to my favourite songs on Spotify in our room in Barcelona, Fátima
mentioned her.  Jackie Evancho, a
beautiful, well mannered little girl from Penssylvania became famous after
singing on the America’s Got Talent show last year where she came surprisingly
number two and not number one. Since then she has gone on to make various
albums and has sung none other than for President Obama.  Her style is what they call classical crossover
and I love it.  She reminds me of
Charlotte Church, although Jackie’s soprano operatic voice seems even
stronger.  You look at this little girl
and wonder how she can have the voice of a 30 year old opera singer.  If she can sing like this at the age of 10 or
11, I cannot begin to imagine what her voice will be like when she reaches 30. If
you haven’t heard of her, just listen to her <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKhmFSV-XB0">here on You Tube</a> and I know you
will agree with me that a star has been born.

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Apart from
being the week I discovered Jackie Evancho, it was also the week <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/25/us-spain-usa-shipwreck-idUSTRE81O0P520120225">treasure returned to Spain</a> and not just any treasure. Last Saturday saw the end of a
journey that the Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes ship started towards Spain in
1804.  The ship sunk after an attack by
English ships when it approached the Portuguese coast.  200 people died and the sea swallowed its
huge treasure of gold and silver that had come from Peru. Years later the
600.000 silver and gold coins were salvaged by an American treasure hunting
ship called Odyssey who thought the treasure was theirs for keeping. However
the Spanish authorities entered legal proceedings and in a way won the Nuestra
Señora de las Mercedes last battle when the treasure was returned to
Spain.  I had hoped that it would help to
improve the Spanish economy as it is worth thousands of millions of euros, but
apparently not.  It will be considered
historical heritage and as I write is being cleaned and polished and restored
for later exhibition in some maritime museum. 
The story has been in the news for days and the main angle is that
Spanish treasure is being returned to its right owners.  But I ask myself whether that is really so
and that perhaps the Peruvian authorities may think otherwise.  </span></div>
