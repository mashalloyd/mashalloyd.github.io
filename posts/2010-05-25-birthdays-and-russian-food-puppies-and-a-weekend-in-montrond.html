</tbody></table> Hi again.<br></br>
<br></br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">I’m two days late with my blog and so must apologise. That always happens when we go away for weekends I’m afraid and we have been away yet again, to Montrondo this time but more about that later.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Just after I wrote my last post it was my dear friend Julio’s birthday. He won’t be reading this though as he’s not a one for blogging or facebooking and is certainly missing out on the social media revolution. I came across this <a href="http://socialnomics.net/2010/05/05/social-media-revolution-2-refresh/">link</a> the other day and was fascinated to see the statistics. </div><br></br>
1. Over 50% of the world’s population is under 30-years-old<br></br>
<br></br>
2. 96% of them have joined a social network<br></br>
<br></br>
3. Facebook tops Google for weekly traffic in the U.S.<br></br>
<br></br>
4. Social Media has overtaken porn as the #1 activity on the Web<br></br>
<br></br>
5. 1 out of 8 couples married in the U.S. last year met via social media<br></br>
<br></br>
6. Years to Reach 50 million Users: Radio (38 Years), TV (13 Years), Internet (4 Years), iPod (3 Years)…<br></br>
<br></br>
7. Facebook added over 200 million users in less than a year<br></br>
<br></br>
8. iPhone applications hit 1 billion in 9 months.<br></br>
<br></br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">These are just some. The rest you can read <a href="http://socialnomics.net/2010/05/05/social-media-revolution-2-refresh/">here</a>. As a colleague commented when she read them; “unbelievable and fantastic, it makes me feel lucky to be taking part in it”. I feel just the same but I know Julio doesn’t. I hope however he had a great birthday. We were supposed to have lunch to celebrate but it didn’t work out. Fátima cancelled at the last minute which rather annoyed me as I am such a stickler with my diary. The reason was a last minute conference call. To tell you the truth there is nothing I hate more than conference calls. I find them absolutely useless and avoid them as much as possible. What bugs me about them is so many people talking at the same time and not knowing when to interrupt or who is there. But they are the norm these days with so many virtual teams in the corporate world.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The week actually began with a bang and here I am writing something pretty personal but then again not to include it would make our family history rather incomplete. So here goes. On Monday evening Suzy announced she had broken up with her boyfriend Gaby with whom she has been going out for 5 years. She broke up with him 2 years ago but within a fortnight they were back together. But this time it seems it’s for real. I am not going to write my opinion here as this is her story and not mine. I am, though,  very sorry for him as he loved her to bits and is a very good guy. Now a new chapter starts in Suzy’s life and I hope, of course, that all goes well for her. But wow that was big news in our house. I spoke to her yesterday and reflected that maybe Oli and her see us as role models in their relationships as we are so united and they maybe want to imitate us. Possibly, possibly ....</div><br></br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">After the bang, the rest of the week, at least for me, was pretty quiet. The highlights were lunch with a journalist from El Mundo and my boss at a great little place called <a href="http://www.elchaflan.com/">El Chaflán</a> and a meeting with the people behind Facebook Spain. That was revealing and fascinating for someone like me who is so addicted to Facebook. They have more than 400 million users in the world (about half in the US and the most of the other half in Europe) and some 10 million users in Spain. 48% are men and 52% are women. For so many “customers” they are a very lean organisation, just some 1.500 people with small offices opening all around the world. I wanted to know how to grow our Yoigo fan page (now called “like”) and hear about successful case studies. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br>
</div><div style="text-align: justify;">A few years ago my dream job would have been with Google, today my ambition would probably be with Facebook. However there is no company where I would get such good work conditions as in Yoigo so I am definitely staying put and enjoying it too. It continually surprises me to see how well Yoigo is doing and growing. Every month we are the leaders in portability (people who change operators) and in the first 3 months of this year we have garnered some 47% of all new subscriptions in Spain. The other day I got a very motivating private message on Facebook from someone who works for the competition which I took as a real compliment:: <em>“Vi los resultados de Yoigo. Quería darte la enhorabuena porque soy de los que piensa que la competencia es sana para todo el mundo. En el fondo, es lo mejor que puede pasarle a España. Un abrazo” </em></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

</tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Another highlight of the week had to do with food. It’s no secret that I adore it but then I wonder who does not. So, nothing to be ashamed about as it’s one of life’s biggest pleasures as I’m sure you will all agree. The food in question was Russian. There are some Russian dishes which I associate with my childhood and which my Mother made and bring back lovely memories, and one of these is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borscht">Borsch. </a>It is a soup made of fresh beetroot, cabbage, potatoes and meat and you eat it with smetana (sour cream) and dill. We had some recently in New York at the <a href="http://www.russiantearoomnyc.com/">Russian Tea Room</a> and so I decided to ask our Ukranian home help, Zena, if she knew how to make it. The question was rather silly as of course she does as borsch is just as popular there as in Russia. So I asked her to make some for us and along she came last Wednesday with a big Tupperware full of it plus some real smetana. I had my doubts it would be as good as my Mother’s but it turned out to be nearly as good. My father, Eladio and I ate it for 3 days running but unfortunately the girls, who have not been brought up on it, didn’t want to try what they called “the red soup” which Suzy said tasted a bit “earthy”. I loved it and will be asking Zena to make us some more another time. </div><br></br>

</tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">The end of the week brought a nasty summer cold with it, not at all welcome and highly unusual for me. That was on Thursday so on Friday I thought I ought to see the doctor before heading off to Montrondo for the weekend, just in case it was something more. I went to a local clinic and was attended by an Argentinian equivalent of a GP who took no notice of my cold but started doing a complete check up which took me by surprise. My only conclusion is that the clinic was after my “business”, i.e. sending me off for tests in return for payment from my medical insurance company. I was furious and will not be going back and of course will not be doing the tests. I wonder how widespread this is. Luckily the cold is better now and one of the remedies came from my sister-in-law, Dolores, who gave me hot water with lemon and honey which was much better than anything the doctor prescribed me! Thanks Dolores. </div><br></br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Saturday brought with it another birthday, but not just any birthday. It was Oli’s 25th. Yeah, a quarter of a century! Every time the girls have a birthday I think back to the day they were born and wonder at how many years have passed by. It should make me feel “old” and it does at times. However the other day I bumped into someone I hadn’t seen for many years: Pablo Antón, the ex Manager of the Once, a top Spanish cycling team. He looked at me and asked whether I had made a pact with the devil as I was looking so good. I hope he was sincere. I feel good so maybe I look good. That’s how it usually works. Who did look superb though on Saturday was my beautiful daughter Olivia whom you can’t beat for looks.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody>

<div style="text-align: justify;">On Saturday we spent the day with Dolores, José Antonio and Sara and their delightful new puppies who are an acquisition of Miguel’s. Miguel is planning on going to live in Montrondo and work from there and also try his hand as a farmer. There are plans for sheep, goats, a horse, a donkey and chickens. I fell in love equally with little Nesca, a very lively three month old mongrel and dear Nuba also a mongrel. Nuba spent two days on my lap sleeping peacefully whilst Nesca caused a riot wherever she went.</div><br></br>

Eladio is away everyday this week as he is invigilating exams at the Uned (equivalent of the Open University). He is always here so it’s strange to face each day without him. He goes very early and comes back late. However he’s back on time for our evening walk which is now getting later and later as it so hot and of course light until nearly 10. I’ll leave you with this great picture I took on one of our walks recently with Norah and where you can appreciate the colour in the fields from the wild flowers which make them a sight to see. You can see more pictures of our walk <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=215545&amp;id=612236553&amp;l=9debf1cd62">here on Facebook.</a></div></div><br></br>
