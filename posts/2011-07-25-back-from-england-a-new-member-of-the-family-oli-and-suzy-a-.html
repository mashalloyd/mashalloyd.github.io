<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Hello again</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">How fast this week has gone past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We were back from England last Monday and the
memories are still very fresh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was a
great holiday, jam packed with everything I wanted to do that I had missed,
except of course seeing my best friend Amanda.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>In England the weather was very dodgy and the temperature never went
higher than about 20ºc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Luckily it hasn’t
been too hot in Madrid, so the adaptation to the local climate has been
gradual.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Today, Monday, is a holiday,
Santiago, and right now I have the air conditioning on as I write from my desk
at home, whilst Oli, Eladio and my Father are sleeping the siesta.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The dogs will be sleeping too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You know about Norah, our beagle of course
and you probably knew we were acquiring a Labrador puppy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We have a new member of the family to
welcome. Little Elsa came to live with us last Tuesday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She is just over 2.5 months old and already
weighs 9 kilos (Norah weighs 10 and is fully grown). Thus she is not so little
Elsa and we have put her on a diet since she arrived. We were worried how Norah
would react but our worries were quite unfound as the meeting went off quite
well and now they seem to be quite good playmates. </span></div>

<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Elsa grows before your very eyes and right now
Norah is the boss but who knows for how long.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>They are both a constant joy and I have to admit we are a pretty dog mad
family and I for one, far prefer puppies and dogs to babies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150245841675949.326651.651745948&amp;l=d097838840&amp;type=1">Here</a> is the set of photos that Rocío, Suzy’s
and Oli’s dog crazy friend, took of the first meeting, something she wouldn’t
have missed for the world.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The same day Elsa came and just one day after
our return, I was back into the swing of work and went into the office to do
this and that and sort of show my face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>My next big project is our participation at the Santander telecoms
congress at the beginning of September and I really must get a heads start on
that soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>To quote my Father, I am
procrastinating, something which I often do when I don’t have much to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The more there is on my plate, the more I do,
but when the plate is less than half full I seem to slow down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">That certainly is not Olivia’s case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Olivia is very busy and I must say we are
very proud of her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She is working with
the TVE 24h evening news programme, <a href="http://www.rtve.es/television/lanocheen24horas/">La Noche en 24 Horas</a>, as part of her master degree in TV
journalism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She will be working there
for 3 months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Meanwhile she has an
internship with the morning programme of TVE1, <a href="http://www.rtve.es/television/la-manana-de-la-1/">La Mañana de la 1</a>. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So imagine her life at the moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She is up at the crack of dawn at 6 to be at the
studio in Prado del Rey where she starts work at 7 for the Mañana de la 1
programme which goes live from 10 to 14h.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>She comes home for lunch, watches the news, has a short sleep, swims and
then gets ready to go to Torrespaña to be there at 18h.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Her work there finishes at midnight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She can only rest at the weekends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Oli is very happy with her two jobs
especially the evening news programme and we have seen some of her news pieces
or items which she edits herself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She
does pieces on all sorts of subjects, football, Obama, the famine in Africa or
whatever she is asked to or suggests. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>For
the moment we have to suffice with hearing her very professional voice but one
day surely we will see her on camera too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>As Suzy says, one day she will be famous and we will be the family of a
famous member of our family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Who knows,
the world is her oyster. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Olivia only has the weekends to relax and
recover and as she has quite a heavy social life there is not much time left to
spend with her parents. Thus we booked some time with her last night and took
her out to dinner. We went to one of our favourite places, La
Alpargatería.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Here is a moment of the
two of us together. It was what I called quality time together.</span></div>

<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">You may wonder why Suzy was not in the picture.
Well she had gone to our beach apartment in Santa Pola for the weekend with her
boyfriend Gaby, his small cousin Adri and his parents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I took her to Gaby’s workplace on Friday from
where they were leaving and unexpectedly for me, met his parents, Isabel and
Pepe, for the first time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had been
told by both my girls that they were lovely people and that’s exactly the
impression I got when I met them on Friday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It was an awkward moment, as these kinds of meetings can be, but I’m glad
that I liked them. </span></div>

<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">As Susana was in Santa Pola she missed the
visit of Eladio’s family from León this weekend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Pili, Eladio’s sister and her husband Andrés
were coming to Madrid on Saturday morning to view a flat for their daughter
Paula.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Coming with them were Eladio’s
brother Isidro and his wife Yoli, as their daughter and our god daughter, Alicia,
will be sharing a flat with Paula from September onwards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Alicia is coming to study nursing and Paula
will be doing a master degree in Corporate Communication, my field of work. Funnily
enough the flat they came to see belongs to my friend Pedro Delgado, of cycling
fame, and his wife Ludi.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Miguel, my
nephew had suggested the idea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They
liked it as soon as they saw it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thus
after lunch they were free of flat hunting and came to see us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They had rung in the morning to say they
would be spending the night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>As soon as
they rang, I went out to the local supermarket, to the best one around, Supercor,
to stock up on lots of nice summer produce to make a dinner for a lot of
people. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">They caught us in the middle of our siesta,
half sleeping, half watching the Tour of France in the middle of the
afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Soon we were all relaxing by
the pool and having a great time together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Later with the help of my sisters-in-law I prepared a lovely dinner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Just as Paula and her boyfriend Pedro were
leaving, Oli arrived with her friends Laura and Rocío with whom she had spent
the day in Avila. That was the moment we were all together, so I asked Rocío,
who is becoming my official photographer, hahaha, to take a photo of us all,
including Elsa, the new arrival.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Yesterday, Sunday, was spent relaxing by the
pool and spending some time with Olivia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>For us it was relaxing but for the sport of cycling it was the
culmination of the year’s most important event, the <a href="http://www.letour.fr/us/homepage_courseTDF.html">Tour de France</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Those of you who don’t know me well may
wonder why I write about cycling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It is
a sport close to my heart after the years spent sponsoring a team when I worked
for Motorola.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I got very involved and
still today have many friends I made then. Even though I have not kept in
contact with them all, many of them live on in my heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So I was very glad for 34 year old <a href="http://www.cadelevans.com.au/">Cadel Evans</a> when he
won yesterday, the first win ever for his country, Australia, quite a
feat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But in my heart I was gladder for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ochowicz">Jim Ochowicz</a>, his team Director.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>“Och”
as he is often called was the Motorola Cycling Team coach and someone I was
always very fond of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In my heart I was
also glad for <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com.au/Author/Guinness,%20Rupert">Rupert Guinness</a>, an amiable Australian sports journalist who
really comes from the Guinness family and who will have been ecstatic at his
countryman’s win yesterday. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>It was Paul
Sherwen, the Motorola Cycling Team PR director who introduced me to Rupert and
also to Graham Watson, the sports best ever photographer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They were a threesome who, along with many
other people in the cycling world, took me under their wing when I landed in
this sport, a woman in her thirties, wearing a skirt in the early 90’s and who
knew nothing about cycling at the time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It was thanks to them and many others, such as Chico Pérez, Javier Ares,
Manolo Saiz, Rafa Gómez, Hennie Kuiper, Pedro Delgado, Carlos de Andrés, Stephen
Roche and many more people, that I too became part of the cycling family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So, yesterday, of course I would have liked
to see Spain’s Contador, win, but in my heart I was happy for Och, Rupert, Paul
and Graham.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The only black cloud on this week’s horizon comes
from the usually pacific little country of Norway. On Friday afternoon the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/norway/8655175/Oslo-explosion-live-coverage.html">newsof the tragedy</a> hit the world like a bomb shell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>A young right wing fanatic
called Anders Behring, who apparently acted alone and is on trial as I write,
killed 7 people in a car bomb attack by the Labour Government Headquarters in the
city of Oslo. Meanwhile he crossed the water to the nearby island of Utoya,
dressed as a policeman where he gathered the hundreds of young people attending
a Labour youth camp pretending to inform them of what had happened in
Oslo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He then began to massacre them one
by one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>All together he has killed over
90 people and Norway is in a state of shock as is the world around it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>To quote my Norwegian colleague Espen: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">“The atmosphere is Oslo is special, the city
is alive but no one smiles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The
Government district is bombed out and the news is full of terrible witness
descriptions from camp-island.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Heart breaking
to read and hear their dreadful stories”. </i>It’s a terrible story and I’m
sorry to end this week’s blog post with the news of the Oslo holocaust, but of
course I must, as it cannot be forgotten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>I will not, however, post a photo of the person who perpetrated it all
as I think he needs no more publicity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">
