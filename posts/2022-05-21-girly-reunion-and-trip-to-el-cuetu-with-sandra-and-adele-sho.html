My dearest friends Sandra and Adele arrived on Monday for a girly week together. We hadn't been together since 2019 and this was a long awaited reunion. We had 4 nights together at our house in Asturias where I was keen to show them the area. We first met at Nottingham University when we must have been 18. It is marvelous that nearly 50 years later we are still best friends. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Before I start though, let me wind back to last Sunday. That day more guests were arriving; a Chinese family, Yinzi and her two daughters aged 12 and 10, had come to spend 3 weeks with us. Yinzi is Olivia's age, who, by the way, turns 37 today, and they had escaped lock down in Shanghai and come to Madrid. Yinzi told me she was fed up with how the Chinese authorities dealt with Covid and couldn't stand yet another lock down. Yinzi, a lovely, lovely woman, knew Spain as she had spent a few years here doing a Masters degree. This is where her daughters were born; thus they were able to leave China. Not so, her husband or so she thought as later in the week she had news he would be allowed to join his family. They soon settled in and are a delight to host.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We went on our walk in the now thick woods, thick with wild flowers and all still so green. It was Pippa`s first walk in a long time and ours too. Eladio spent a lot of the day mowing the lawns while I prepared the rooms with fruit and flowers - beautiful roses and mock orange blossom - from the garden. I also made a simple lunch after which we had a siesta. The rest of the day was very peaceful. We now had 4 guests in the house but it is so big we often don't see our guests. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">I was looking forward to <b>Monday</b>, the day Sandra and Adele would arrive from Brussels and Orleans. I also had to plan our journey the next day to Asturias. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">My day started quietly as it usually does. On the world scene the main news was the application to join Nato by Sweden and Finland, both neutral countries until now. The move is obvious, the fear of Moscow. But how would Putin react? If his main objective when invading Ukraine was to curtail Nato's power in the region, then this new move would only serve to intensify it. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">On a much happier note I was pleased to read in the news that morning that the Queen, aged 96 and now with limited mobility, had happily attended a Platinum Jubilee equestrian horse show. Called "A gallop through history, the performance took place at the Royal Windsor Horse Show. A comedian commented "Your RH, on behalf of everyone here we would like to thank you for picking us over the State Opening of Parliament which she didn't attend, to which the Queen laughed. Everyone knows about her obsession with horses but not that she has  a wry sense of humour.  I think she enjoyed every moment of the show, God bless her.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRBQ7AZ0cNC8DP18NPwWg-fp69MVkUhhPHJK-OMnzgjefzSo867bLbRFDB09i52u3udtgAZ2yn73z7n9lVwmO6Li6aQwjQUCNS4CFK2Jng45f_E44nOQx8nC4RJozdu7QIQE1jlBzhL3nVFAo0_sfo40YRNgN1mIyz6wmTwoUs_OfqPqeCZK0/s400/p0c6zbfb.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="224" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjRBQ7AZ0cNC8DP18NPwWg-fp69MVkUhhPHJK-OMnzgjefzSo867bLbRFDB09i52u3udtgAZ2yn73z7n9lVwmO6Li6aQwjQUCNS4CFK2Jng45f_E44nOQx8nC4RJozdu7QIQE1jlBzhL3nVFAo0_sfo40YRNgN1mIyz6wmTwoUs_OfqPqeCZK0/w400-h224/p0c6zbfb.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Queen seen at the Horse Show and enjoying every moment. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Monday was a special day for our grandchildren too.

Sandra was here first and took a cab so that I wouldn't have to make two 90km return journeys to the airport. Sandra was arriving at 11.50 and Adele at 15.45.

They had come to remove a prototype car that my French guests who stayed last week had left when it wouldn't start. The car was a bit of a mystery as it had no branding. Miguel my son in law guessed it was a prototype car for Uber like fleets and it turned out he was right. The car was painted in stripes which had me a bit puzzled. It was my neighbour Julio who told me that was done on purpose so that if people took photos the shape or curves of the car would not appear so it could not be copied by rivals. That day we had 2 such cars. Here is Eladio next to one of these funny prototypes.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg1tNGiTb4ihrGMa_wEIApNAp0HofSguLvq-qHKKm163-ln4625TtU3tP6x7-b6dcTcS9pFYQns5zVr82xYDzcx4nvfUd4GcR6uzvvlB5fm-47HVKGTFCJWPmF1y3YFYMyv0wx-hh4WIA7Jl0-64t4tEvAuDDLbDBLHR8tJ1kvGcli51ZiOn-M/s4032/Monday%20renault.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg1tNGiTb4ihrGMa_wEIApNAp0HofSguLvq-qHKKm163-ln4625TtU3tP6x7-b6dcTcS9pFYQns5zVr82xYDzcx4nvfUd4GcR6uzvvlB5fm-47HVKGTFCJWPmF1y3YFYMyv0wx-hh4WIA7Jl0-64t4tEvAuDDLbDBLHR8tJ1kvGcli51ZiOn-M/w400-h180/Monday%20renault.jpg" width="400"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>One of the Renault prototype cars that was removed by mechanics from the company</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">It was an intriguing car but I was glad to see it go as it would leave a parking space for our guests. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Sandra arrived just before 1 pm and it was such an emotional moment. It was great to see her. The last time had been January 2020; two years ago. We chilled out until lunch time when we served red lentil soup and stuffed shoulder of lamb. She came armed with Belgian biscuits and chocolates. I especially liked the Pierre Marconi heart shaped ones.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiahyPS9QVKZYvIuK4q9tbrG3LZjOeobuhb4OeIxZa4Puy8T-5mlO4zsMGC_mlH6Y5tO41l5iPy6dHqzpJPaHNj9U_S8FIVro_FGWrs-MvAUbzge3Ts5GJb6yxoBguYNJyFh3OB-5Slj19TgtD7bXTQaMjU9E3VKK2taOmC1wKRVhGuUH-o2sE/s4032/Monday%20chocolate.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiahyPS9QVKZYvIuK4q9tbrG3LZjOeobuhb4OeIxZa4Puy8T-5mlO4zsMGC_mlH6Y5tO41l5iPy6dHqzpJPaHNj9U_S8FIVro_FGWrs-MvAUbzge3Ts5GJb6yxoBguYNJyFh3OB-5Slj19TgtD7bXTQaMjU9E3VKK2taOmC1wKRVhGuUH-o2sE/w180-h400/Monday%20chocolate.jpg" width="180"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Chocolates from Sandra</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">At 14.45 we set off to pick up Adele. The journey took 45 minutes and soon we were reunited with our Uni friend. The three of us became firm friends in 1976 in our first year at Nottingham University. We spent the rest of the afternoon chatting, drinking tea and eating cake (Battenberg from M&S) and enjoying the good weather. Dinner was made by Lucy - Spanish tortilla with fresh asparagus and ham. Adele had brought some exquisite French chocolates too and so many gifts, we felt inundated. They really didn't have to. We were up until about 10.30 pm, all shattered and in need of a good night's sleep.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I had a bad night coughing for most of it and finally got up at 5 am. We wouldn't be leaving for Asturias until 10 but I was excited and wanted to get up, even if it was at the crack of dawn. We left at around 9.45 and had to have a photo of the moment. Eladio obliged.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiC0C9Ru68nOUz9WuthqUOFXCvF9fCrvKgTkNzNwbLszx1P9PncQfmRTiyEngU6RlmRvQVs4AW7M8AMaloO4i6YMUaq5_FfX0IYRdYwbtSuRUc-6cRjHU7fHiH-dAoePNPtoOYoqaRTPPMdDGPGyEWu16YWWr9_RCALfXLbDnF8vTdt7GltN-g/s4032/Car%20leaving.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiC0C9Ru68nOUz9WuthqUOFXCvF9fCrvKgTkNzNwbLszx1P9PncQfmRTiyEngU6RlmRvQVs4AW7M8AMaloO4i6YMUaq5_FfX0IYRdYwbtSuRUc-6cRjHU7fHiH-dAoePNPtoOYoqaRTPPMdDGPGyEWu16YWWr9_RCALfXLbDnF8vTdt7GltN-g/w400-h180/Car%20leaving.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The moment before we left on our road trip</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">I drove my lovely Mini for the first hour and a half. We stopped for coffee and then at Palacio de Bornos, that lovely winery in Rueda, an area that specialises in delicious white wine. We have been going for years as it on the road to both Montrondo and Asturias. I was keen to share my love of it with my friends. We were warmly welcomed by the staff there and I wanted my friends to taste the wine. We got the full works of wine tasting and I was delighted my friends loved the local "verdejo" based wine - a local grape - for their white wine, as much as I do. Here we are having a ball tasting various types of wine of which we would buy 2 whole boxes!</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEize08a1RYy9cIRF2Zh3LFNLJs7nivGCyWfaZWXkCzqS9vmQi4NvsnaXd53rJwMYY4d_E23kOv5-k4BwFwPxh1mgTXu9twfSovRyxjg3UVwGz3mpYJ-t0OjFJWIYRRgVf-YfuiwGawLgUteIQ3Uw8Eo1duMuWB6nNVzs27O_SilniQLcNT9wt0/s3616/3.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="201" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEize08a1RYy9cIRF2Zh3LFNLJs7nivGCyWfaZWXkCzqS9vmQi4NvsnaXd53rJwMYY4d_E23kOv5-k4BwFwPxh1mgTXu9twfSovRyxjg3UVwGz3mpYJ-t0OjFJWIYRRgVf-YfuiwGawLgUteIQ3Uw8Eo1duMuWB6nNVzs27O_SilniQLcNT9wt0/w400-h201/3.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Having a ball tasting the wine at Palacio de Bornos</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">My friends then experienced the food to have with the wine; a platter of freshly cut ham as well as a platter of cheese and lomo which we ate with fresh local bread sprinkled with olive oil. The piéce de résistance was the white chocolate with almonds we polished off for dessert. It must be very good chocolate if my friends from France and Belgium appreciated it.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">We were in El Cuetu by just after 4 pm and it was probably the warmest day I have ever experienced there. We put the food away and then had a cup of tea on the terrace. We needed the parasol and thankfully Pepe, our neighbour, brought out the very heavy base to place it on. We didn't have  Eladio there to do all the little things I usually rely on him for so we had to be very self sufficient. We then unpacked and as we had a few hours before it got dark (after 9.30 pm) I took the girls to one of my favourite places around here. I have so many it is often difficult to choose where to go. I took them to the little seaside village of Niembro where there is a sort of fjord with a beautiful church and cemetery which seems to sit on the sea. What a place to be buried.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjI4UDyucbsY60EcjvI_Mj7jHlA69YccnwiAYQ-tQ-FjMwZT3zB-aV4RNHYb03bvOlTKZiJFICxQrmDOMIOvbBJ5fxEVHZrQzg9qoiQY7a1UpsSzu0y0tOBskdx7fdqtWnMr_HlzlzKCqspyKofF0tN_obkHaRacphZwHDN-D5UqoeKTQnn9Ik/s4032/cemetery.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjI4UDyucbsY60EcjvI_Mj7jHlA69YccnwiAYQ-tQ-FjMwZT3zB-aV4RNHYb03bvOlTKZiJFICxQrmDOMIOvbBJ5fxEVHZrQzg9qoiQY7a1UpsSzu0y0tOBskdx7fdqtWnMr_HlzlzKCqspyKofF0tN_obkHaRacphZwHDN-D5UqoeKTQnn9Ik/w400-h180/cemetery.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Adele left and Sandra right at the cemetery belonging to the church called Our Lady of the Sorrows</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The tide was in so we couldn't walk on the beach.

There we bumped into the previous owners, Mari and José Manuel, who had sold us the house. Sandra and I nearly polished off a whole bottle of cider and Adele had two glasses of white wine. I never usually drink but when I have British friends to stay I can't help but join in. It was about 8.30 but before we left I wanted my friends to see another view of the beach by walking up to a stretch of very green grass to appreciate the place properly and they did. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiLEDn7WKbH3nD3eHVX1G4PIBtQWmK0zaXCc2RV7-ypVJpKdxzNRNXqJSc6jfXycn3KoZgnWHyd3uVkdONxgoGYivcOm1ez_e140tc3g8xN7-u9M2P96TH8qfleCnT26qC7XHFPoeYfO9SryIL0z7bTpiA-aFkHl58cJnZ1aFNEuN_o-fX_bVo/s4032/20220517_202407.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiLEDn7WKbH3nD3eHVX1G4PIBtQWmK0zaXCc2RV7-ypVJpKdxzNRNXqJSc6jfXycn3KoZgnWHyd3uVkdONxgoGYivcOm1ez_e140tc3g8xN7-u9M2P96TH8qfleCnT26qC7XHFPoeYfO9SryIL0z7bTpiA-aFkHl58cJnZ1aFNEuN_o-fX_bVo/w400-h180/20220517_202407.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Barru - simply gorgeous</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">Adele kept saying the scenery reminded her of Brittany but it also reminded us of Scotland, Wales or even the Yorkshire coast as it is so rugged.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">From Barru we drove the short way home and by 9ish we were enjoying a delicious dinner of what I call "bits and bobs".

Even so it wasn't that bad a night and I was up at 5.45.

What a wonderful day it had been.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The whole day had been simply marvelous and Thursday would be too. I think actually Thursday was the best day of all. It was the day I took my friends to the legendary Lakes of Covadonga in the heart of the Peaks of Europe. On most days of the year cars are not allowed and people get there by shuttle bus but we were lucky as the rule starts from 30th May. I checked the weather to make sure there would be no fog or clouds and we were blessed with a sunny day with good visibility. We weren't the only ones up there but it was not crowded at all as it usually is on weekends and in the summer. It's a 50 minute drive from our house up a steep and windy mountain road which worried Adele as she hates heights or driving on roads with sheer drops such as the road to Covadonga. The scenery was to die for; simply stunning and the drive well worth it for the scenery when you arrive at the Lakes. It is one of the most popular stages in the Tour of Spain and my friend, Pedro Delgado, a cycling legend in Spain is always associated with this stage. His name is painted on the road in many parts. The first lake you get to is Enol and there we stopped to admire it and have photos taken by other hikers.  I have chosen that as this week's feature photo which was a very hard choice.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibK9SNqslnx0PLErlljQ48kuPnlDaKOMhhJVyCkfili9Cp4MIjcmKGXuLV-9CR9iyAK35_D-VIm5CqpT9wOJ_72fS2DggteBnnd1tY7b65vDe7bGMMENV6W6gfoXp3fjH7eLxLkVqJxwdk2HL4K-4JpooCPdZa6jhp71eC8Vhb4XQjBh32b6o/s4032/3%20Lago%20Enol.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibK9SNqslnx0PLErlljQ48kuPnlDaKOMhhJVyCkfili9Cp4MIjcmKGXuLV-9CR9iyAK35_D-VIm5CqpT9wOJ_72fS2DggteBnnd1tY7b65vDe7bGMMENV6W6gfoXp3fjH7eLxLkVqJxwdk2HL4K-4JpooCPdZa6jhp71eC8Vhb4XQjBh32b6o/w400-h180/3%20Lago%20Enol.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Lago Enol</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">It was taken by a  lovely English group of people, from Nottingham, the University town where we three met.  Later we had coffee with them further up at Lake Ercina. We parked nearby Lake Enol and then walked the steep road up to Lake Ercina which takes about 15 minutes. All we could do was go "oh" and "ah" as we admired the stunning scenery. The Lakes of Covadonga are a must  go to place on anyone's bucket list when visiting Spain. Forget the Costas, come up to the lush green coast of the north of the country. My friends couldn't believe this was Spain. It looked more like Switzerland, cows with cow bells included. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Once at Lake Ercina I took my friends for a coffee at the bar there which is such a lovely one. Just sitting on the wooden benches admiring the Lake with its backdrop of snow capped mountains is enough to heal your soul. We invited the friendly group of English people who are hikers and were visiting this lush coast with its famous Peaks of Europe. Here we are together. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuuQZGadhqvkvuZyr8z1bwMVEbr-wqY1nWeqwFKlBSERWVxPeZZNxn7d2LN2k3Ko78pfRo4nx-xVq2Rz-MPrEymCSLcV24YWyg3-gxzKhm7telhGKCmDWmWOF3wKnH3-m8x0dqziTXgblHIB0EEZst5TouMxt5ZipE4BPm6i6cz6wE9JHfbzw/s4032/Ercina%20with%20the%20Brits.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuuQZGadhqvkvuZyr8z1bwMVEbr-wqY1nWeqwFKlBSERWVxPeZZNxn7d2LN2k3Ko78pfRo4nx-xVq2Rz-MPrEymCSLcV24YWyg3-gxzKhm7telhGKCmDWmWOF3wKnH3-m8x0dqziTXgblHIB0EEZst5TouMxt5ZipE4BPm6i6cz6wE9JHfbzw/w400-h180/Ercina%20with%20the%20Brits.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>With our new found British friends at Lake Ercina on Thursday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">I would have loved to have lunch at the cabin shaped bar - Bar Maria Rosa - but we had a table booked at my favourite restaurant in the area.

It was a 30 minute drive down the mountain and at about just after 2 pm we were there. This is the once humble little restaurant which has now been made famous after various TV reports. The chef is a guy called Cristian who is actually a friend of my friend Miguel who is from Cangas. There is a 15 euro menu of the day or you can choose a la carte.

They did not tell us off after I explained our trouble with the satnav. They told us how to get out and then offered to escort us to the main road. We were all very impressed. In another country no doubt we would have been fined but these two policemen came to the rescue of 3 ladies who felt like they were in a Thelma and Louise type film. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEim4i95KSLNFBDsJqy7MokUdKMJMoq7NQkJ_s17KHhkTYIp99kALs_fTPt5jv1MhpcHlwfBEG4zMIYy-QZRgOaSqstu66eGiS_IPEF8jf2cskh_PUIKih7uCbxanQzoG1_LnY7vhHnx7pnxFWea2lPwWs0USiVl3uXpGSctLrJ3_zeoYRPK9oQ/s762/Gc%20to%20the%20rescue.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEim4i95KSLNFBDsJqy7MokUdKMJMoq7NQkJ_s17KHhkTYIp99kALs_fTPt5jv1MhpcHlwfBEG4zMIYy-QZRgOaSqstu66eGiS_IPEF8jf2cskh_PUIKih7uCbxanQzoG1_LnY7vhHnx7pnxFWea2lPwWs0USiVl3uXpGSctLrJ3_zeoYRPK9oQ/w400-h180/Gc%20to%20the%20rescue.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Spanish Civil Guard police escorting us back to the road. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I had to take a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFqszu1Loqw">video</a> to upload on my YouTube channel as well as to post on the Guardia Civil twitter handle so as to thank them publicly.

Shortly afterwards we stopped too at Posada to go to  the shoe shop, "Pisando Fuerte". Sandra had dropped a ring there the day before. She had lost it and thought it might have happened there. I rang and was told by Marta the shopkeeper that she had found it and even posted it on Facebook. That's honesty for you. Sandra was much relieved to get it back. We also went into a children's clothes shop for me get something for the babies. For Oli and Miguel we went into the Lofer bakery and bought the tuna pie they love as well as an applessponge and some delicious little cakes made with almonds - a bit like bakewell tart. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Our journey would take 5 hours straight driving but we stopped for lunch and for a few breaks to stretch our legs. Why do the journeys back always seem so much longer than the journeys going? All 3 of us drove and took it in turns to take the wheel. We soon noticed as we got further from El Cuetu which we had left with 17ºc, that it got warmer and warmer. When we stopped for lunch at Restaurante La Cueva in Alar del Rey it was at least 30ºc. The difference was enormous. While people were sweltering in record breaking temperatures in the centre and south of the country, Asturias remained cool. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEho-niVNsVqI8oE1A1y-RtkaEWHziMUat6tX-krTClmbozH6jMsWuao-NzjifD9lkZNlxsofDoW72zi8xBiAlktYCaEUhC7HdHNPpyoRj3fYuzuXZrUy7xJPA2tydg6P8BrsWeyI1Y7cPEsgNpUEjJ97XFtYMXRKnFPbyDLp3BkahaC9GgwA9Q/s3098/S%20and%20A%20Alar%20del%20Rey.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEho-niVNsVqI8oE1A1y-RtkaEWHziMUat6tX-krTClmbozH6jMsWuao-NzjifD9lkZNlxsofDoW72zi8xBiAlktYCaEUhC7HdHNPpyoRj3fYuzuXZrUy7xJPA2tydg6P8BrsWeyI1Y7cPEsgNpUEjJ97XFtYMXRKnFPbyDLp3BkahaC9GgwA9Q/w400-h225/S%20and%20A%20Alar%20del%20Rey.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Lunch at Alar del Rey</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: justify;">The food at La Cueva never disappoints and we had a great meal and rest. Soon we were on the road again. We arrived home to 33ºc which felt like an outdoor sauna. We also arrived to the end of what seemed to be a pre birthday party lunch for Olivia. The house felt a little overtaken and it was a bit stressful to arrive in such heat and a chaotic household. Thankfully my Chinese guests arrived back when we had cleared everything away. Yinzi and her 2 girls were happy to see their father, JZ, who had also escaped lockdown in Shanghai to join them. He told us he had spent 2 months in the flat without going out and had to have  a test every single day. He likened it to animals in a zoo. Poor chap. He was very happy to be here and with his family. I didn't know but this family who will be here for more than a month had lived in Spain for 5 years some 10 years ago when the father worked for the Santander bank so they know some Spanish and are familiar with the area. I have to say they are fast becoming our friends. They are very likeable. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">After unpacking with the much needed aircon on, we all convened by the still empty pool - it will finally be filled with water today (75.000 litres of water which will cost a pretty penny).

I caught the second half of a wonderful film called "The children act" with Emma Thompson in it. I did not catch the news  though. This whole week I have hardly followed the news but  do know that the disgraced emiritus King of Spain returned from exile in Dubai, to Spain to take part in a regatta. His arrival back after all the financial scandals surrounding him was the biggest news item in Spain. The second biggest news was about the outbreak and  spread of Monkeypox which, no doubt, you will have heard about. It is rather worrying but not for over 50s who have all had the smallpox vaccine which works for Monkeypox, a very mild version of smallpox which was eradicated over 50 years ago. Cases have been detected in 12 European countries including Spain and the UK as well as the US, Canada and Australia. We don't want another virus in this world and I hope by giving under 50s the smallpox vaccine, it may well be eradicated. It is quite mild compared to smallpox but still has some ghastly side effects the worst being swollen lymph nodes on the face and body. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"> I was happy to sleep in my bed again but my damned cough didn't let me get a good night's sleep and I was up this morning at 5.30 am. Today will be a busy and special day. It is Olivia's 37th birthday - where has time gone? and we will be having a family celebration joined by Sandra and Adele but sadly not by Suzy. But we shall probably see her this week as we plan to go to Santa Pola. I shall be busy cooking for Oli's birthday lunch but also preparing for the arrival of 5 more guests today. 5 doctors from Imperial College London will be coming on a repeat stay. I can hardly believe that tonight there will be so many people; Sandra and Adele (2), the Chinese family (4), Eladio and I (2) and the 5 doctors. A total of 13 people will be sleeping here tonight. I just calculated and I think we could actually accommodate a maximum of 19 people. But that would be a bit of a strain on the house. I never really want more than 7 guests at a time.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">It's now time to sign off and begin all the tasks I have ahead of me for today.
