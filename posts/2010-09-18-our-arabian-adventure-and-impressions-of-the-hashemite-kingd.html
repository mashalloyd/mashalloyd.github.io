</div><div>Hi again, </div><div><br></br>
</div><div>Last time I wrote it was our last night in Israel, just under a week ago. And now I am writing from Aqaba on the Red Sea on our last day but one in Jordan. Time has really flown and we have done so much and there is so much to tell. So let me start from the beginning.</div><div><br></br>
</div><div>Our adventure started when we took the bus from Nazareth to the River Jordan crossing which is called the Sheikh Hussein Border in Jordan. We decided to rough it and take the local bus leaving at 08.30. We got up early and had ordered a taxi at 7.30 to take us to the bus stop. It never came, so we ventured into the town with our luggage only to realise later that the clocks had gone back an hour that night in Israel. Thus we had got up at 05.30 and had time to kill on the deserted streets of Nazareth before we could finally board the bus. </div><div><br></br>
</div><div>The drive to the border took only 45 minutes but crossing it was another matter. Israel has borders with many countries (Siria, Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan) but the only ones open are with Jordan, the West Bank, the  Gaza Strip and Egypt.  So relations with the Kingdom are good but security is very strict. There are 3 borders only with Jordan and we went through the River Jordan crossing near Galilee.</div><div><br></br>

</div><div>You get off the bus and go with your passport to the Israeli frontier and pay 100 shekels to leave Israel. You return to the bus, show your passport again to an Israeli border policeman and then the bus drives another 50 metres or so to the Jordanian frontier. Here a Jordanian border official comes on board and checks everyone’s passports. Afterwards you get off the bus and go through the next passport check and visa too if you don’t already have one like we did. </div><div><br></br>

</div><div>That process was fast enough as I have great experience at borders and frontiers in getting to the front of the queues so as to avoid lengthy waiting. We then had to return to the bus and remove our luggage and walk through customs and outside to a sort of no man’s land. Here we thought we would be met by our driver Soufian for our trip in Jordan but that wasn’t to be as only frontier taxis can take you outside and here we met with a bit of bureaucracy. Finally we got a frontier taxi which drove us a kilometre to outside the frontier territory and there was Soufian and his nice Toyota car waiting for us with a cold lemon and mint drink to quench our thirst in the oppressive heat upon our arrival. The whole process of crossing both frontiers had taken just over 2 hours and the feeling we had was as if we had just passed an exam. </div><div><br></br>
</div><div>It was heaven to get into Soufian’s air conditioned big comfortable car and drink that delicious lemon and mint drink which I am beginning to get addicted to. It’s a bit like a mojito without the alcohol! Soufian, a big burly dark skinned man who speaks fast American English with a Jordanian accent, welcomed us to this country and told us he would be our host and driver for the week. We felt we were in good hands. </div><div><br></br>
</div><div>Our first night was to be in Amman but first we were to explore some places on the way. Our first stop was in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umm_Qais">Umm Qais</a> in the very north of Jordan, an ancient Byzantine town and one of the locations where the Miracle of the Gadarene swine is supposed to have taken place. It was hot and we were tired so did not really appreciate the ruins of this town. Truth to tell I am no fan of Roman ruins when they are in a bad shape. I always prefer buildings to be whole, as well as statues, plates and other ancient objects. I get no pleasure of seeing broken Roman columns and headless statues although I am sure a lot of people do. </div><div><br></br>

</div><div>From Umm Qais we drove to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerash">Jerash</a> which is apparently a close second to Petra on the list of favourite destinations in Jordan. I have a different opinion as I think Petra is in another league and no ruined Roman city can rival its beauty and magic but I’ll come to that later. Jerash is supposedly one of the best preserved Roman provincial towns in the Middle East. I wasn’t taken with the ruined amphitheatre and was more impressed with Hadrian’s Arch which was built for when Hadrian was to visit Jerash.</div><div><br></br>

</div><div>From Jerash we drove south to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amman">Amman</a>, the capital city where we were to spend the first night of our Arabian adventure. We were booked into the <a href="http://www.kempinski.com/en/amman/Pages/Welcome.aspx">Kempinski Hotel</a> which is in a residential area and here we were to be introduced to the security procedures in Jordan for entering the hotels. There are bomb detectors for the car and then a security procedure similar to airports. After our simple accommodation in Israel, it was great to be in a clean luxury hotel and of course to be able to cool off in the swimming pool. </div><div><br></br>
On Monday morning we were up early for a tour of the city which was actually only the Roman Citadel where we saw more ruins. <br></br>

We walked along King Talal street and entered into the old fruit market and then on to the main city mosque where we were not allowed in. The streets are noisy and dusty and you see people dressed in both western and Arab attire. Here we bought Eladio a “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keffiyeh">keffiyeh</a>”, the traditional Arab headdress made famous by Yasir Arafat. It is also called a “Hattah”. We bought the Jordanian one in red and white and of course the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agal_(accessory)">Agal </a>black ring shaped accessory to hold it tight on the head. </div><div><br></br>

</div><div>We were to stay at the <a href="http://www.moevenpick-hotels.com/en/pub/your_hotels/worldmap/dead_sea/overview.cfm">Movenpick Resort</a>, the first of the 3 hotels we would be staying at in this Swiss luxury hotel chain. I am not very familiar with resort hotels and I think this is probably the biggest hotel I have ever stayed at. It seemed to me to be the size of a large village. </div><div><br></br>

</div><div>The Dead Sea is dead, nothing lives in it and it contains 33% salt and of course some minerals. There is huge business in Dead Sea cosmetics and they are sold everywhere in Israel and in Jordan and they are not cheap. It is 56km long and 22km wide approximately and 850m deep and of course it is the lowest point on Earth. and therefore has an extremely hot climate.  One side is Israel and the other Jordan. Our first swim was in the evening when we arrived and it was already getting dark and the sea was a bit choppy. Sun sets here at 18.30 this time of year so the afternoons are somewhat short. Thus the famous photo reading a newspaper was out of the question! The water was nearly hot and of course you floated but not quite as much as you may expect. When you come out you have to shower quickly otherwise the salt begins to burn your skin. There is a sort of mud which looked like more like black grease to me that people spread all over their bodies but that was not for me. I preferred using the lovely swimming pool above the stony Dead Sea beach to cool off afterwards.</div><div><br></br>

</div><div>We left the Dead Sea region on Tuesday and were to reach Petra in the south by evening with quite a few stops on the way. We were to go by the scenic route, the <a href="http://www.atlastours.net/jordan/kings_highway.html">King’s Way</a>, an ancient route that still has marks left from traders, armies and pilgrims who crossed it centuries ago. Our first stop was to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Nebo_(Jordan)">Mount Nebo</a> of great religious importance in the Bible as it was here that Moses saw the Promised Land on his way from Egypt. Unfortunately he never reached his destination and legend has it he was buried somewhere near Mount Nebo. You can see Galillee and the Golan Heights from this point and just to stand where Moses stood and see what he saw was an enriching experience.

</div><div>In the late afternoon we finally arrived at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra">Petra</a>, the most interesting place on our itinerary in Jordan and one of the most visited and admired monuments in the world, “the rose-red city half as old as time” to quote Dean Burgen. We were to discover why the next day after a good night’s sleep in our wonderful room at the <a href="http://www.moevenpick-hotels.com/en/pub/your_hotels/worldmap/petra/overview.cfm">Movenpick Hotel</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadi_Musa">Wadi Musa</a> (the Valley of Moses), the town next to Petra full of tourists and souvenir shops. People come to Petra from all over the world, some 3.000 a day in the high season, spend a day there and leave, often not visiting anywhere else in Jordan. </div><div><br></br>
</div><div>We heard later that Petra became a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985 and that the Bedouins (the ancestors of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabataeans">Nabateans</a> who built Petra) who lived in its caves were moved out into a village nearby built specially for them. They were allowed to run the visitor centre and take charge of all the tourist business using their camels, donkeys, horses and selling Bedouin jewellery and thus many of them have become rich; though not all. We also learned that more than 100 Bedouins have married Western women. I was intrigued by that idea and bought a book at the hotel shop called “<a href="http://marriedtoabedouin.com/">Married to a Bedouin</a>” by a New Zealand woman of Dutch extraction who still lives there. I asked one of the Bedouins why Western women were attracted to them and he smiled cheekily and said “because we are strong”! I wonder if that is the only reason. We were to meet many the next day, whose language school is the contact with foreigners visiting Petra like myself. </div><div><br></br>
</div><div>So the next day after another wonderful breakfast we were all ready for discovering Petra. This is a good moment to mention the incredible buffet meals at the hotels in Jordan. They are so good that I am in dire need of returning to my up and down diet. The problem about buffet meals if they are good is that it is difficult not to fill your plate. My downfall, not surprisingly,  is the dessert buffet, especially with the wonderful halva and baklava Middle Eastern sweets I so love.  The food decoration was incredible, with statues made of butter, faces made of pumpkin, flowers made of water melon and endless shapes made of chocolate and even crocodiles made of bread, just to name a few.</div><div><br></br>

</div><div>We were met by Soufian who bought our tickets and introduced us to our personal guide, a charming young Bedouin boy called Okalla (not sure of the spelling - he said it was pronounced O.K. Allah!) who played or rather prayed continuously with his worry beads.   We asked him what he prayed and he said that for each bead he said: "Allah is Great".  He spoke good English and had travelled in Europe and was very knowledgeable about Petra. Before we entered we went past various shops selling souvenirs and I spotted a white headscarf which I thought very appropriate for where I was going, not to mention the heat. I then spotted tunics for men and soon we were both kitted out and looking like locals, especially Eladio who wore the tunic, the keffiyeh and the agal. The headgear was arranged for us by the Bedouins and I think we looked great, especially my Arab look-alike husband! We certainly caused a sensation and quite a few people thought Eladio was genuine and wanted to take photos with him.</div><div><br></br>

</div><div>Petra was established around the 6th century BC as the capital city of the Nabateans and is known as the rose-red city for the colour of the rocks in which it is carved. The ancient city with its water system, carvings, temples and monasteries, which are mostly façades, is hidden inside amazing red coloured mountains and was buried for centuries under sand until it was discovered by a Swiss explorer and archaeologist called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Ludwig_Burckhardt">Johann Ludwig Burckhardt</a> who first came to the area in around 1812 to look for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Aaron">Aaron’s tomb</a>, the tomb of the brother of Moses. It was an important junction on the spice route to China and India. The downfall of Petra came about from a change in this route as well as the invasion by the Roman Empire and finally by natural forces from an earthquake. </div><div><br></br>
</div><div>To get to the hidden city you walk through the siq (damn) through a narrow passageway between the tall red rocks passing caves and resting places and carvings in the rock. On our way we met Cavalry Police, Tourist Police and more interestingly to us, Bedouin Police as you can see in this photo.</div><div><br></br>

The alternative was to hire a donkey for 10 Jordanian dinars each. I hate walking uphill and I love donkeys so this was the perfect answer for me. But wow was it a challenge, great fun but also a frightening experience at times as you went up what seemed like sheer rock which got higher and higher and one wrong foot from your donkey would have you tumbling down the mountains of Petra. The trick was to hold on for dear life, even though it felt like your wrists were breaking.</div><div><br></br>

I just counted and have only been to 9 of the places so will have to hurry up to see the rest as I am not getting younger, hahaha. Funnily enough Petra does not belong to the coveted list of places of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonders_of_the_World">7 wonders of the world</a>.  They include: Great Pyramid of Giza, Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Statue of Zeus at Olympia, Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, Mausoleum of Maussollos at Halicarnassus, Colossus of Rhodes and the Lighthouse of Alexandria).  Petra however is included in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Seven_Wonders_of_the_World">"official new 7 wonders of the world".</a>(Great Wall of China, Christ the Redeemer Statue in Río, Machu Picchu in Peru, Chichen Itza in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, The Roman Colosseum, The Taj Mahal and Petra) and it certainly deserves to be in this new and select club.<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>
We left Petra and drove out of Wadi Musa to see Beida or what is known as <a href="http://www.grandview.com.jo/little_petra.html">Little Petra</a>, a caravan stopping place of the Nabateans. Once again we dressed the part and mixed with the local Bedouins on our visit. They loved Eladio’s dressing like them which I think actually quite surprised them in a positive way and they were very happy to be photographed. </div><div><br></br>

</div><div>From Little Petra we made our way south to the <a href="http://www.wadirum.jo/">Wadi Rum</a> Desert via the King’s Way. Here we were to meet more Bedouins, drink more tea with them and ride across the desert in a very old jeep driven by Hamed who again was delighted to meet Eladio in similar dress. Wadi Rum or the Valley of the Moon is where Lawrence of Arabia based his headquarters during the Arab Revolt against the Ottomans in World War 1. Here we saw various landmarks intrinsically woven into the history of the place and used in the film about him which was filmed here in 1962. One was the Mushroom shaped rock, another the famous 7 pillars of wisdom and the third Lawrence’s cave and personal headquarters where I am standing outside in this next picture.</div><div><br></br>

It was given to Jordan by Saudi Arabia, the border of which is some 20km away, in exchange for a countless amount of desert. The story goes that Saudi Arabia did not want to have a border with Israel. Here in the gulf you can see Egypt, Israel and Saudi Arabia but cannot cross the borders if you have an Israeli stamp in your passport. We learned later that you can ask the Israeli officials to stamp a piece of paper rather than your passport and that way you can travel further. Aqaba is on the famed Red Sea which gets its name from the red coral reef in its bed and people come here to do scuba diving and snorkling, neither of which we were interested in. </div><div><br></br>

It was not in town but just by the Saudi Border at a place called <a href="http://www.talabay.jo/about.shtm">Tala Bay</a>. We were rather glad about that as the night before we arrived the US Government had issued a warning about threats to Aqaba. Eladio was so worried that we rang the Spanish Embassy in Amman. However the Spanish Consul, who took the subject seriously, told us we would be safe but not to go off the tourist route. Thus we stayed at the Resort most of the time only incurring into the city on our last night for dinner and to stroll around the vibrant centre.</div><div><br></br>

</div><div>And now it is Saturday and our last morning in Aqaba before hitting the road for Amman this afternoon for our last night in Jordan. Tomorrow we face our final adventure, crossing the infamous Allenby Bridge (called the King Hussein Bridge here) back into Israel in time to catch the flight to Madrid from Tel Aviv at 16h. We have been told we will need at least 3 hours to cross the border and another 3 hours to go through security at Tel Aviv airport, apparently the strictest in the world. So our Arabian adventure doesn’t end until tomorrow. </div><div><br></br>
</div><div>MY IMPRESSIONS OF JORDAN</div><div><br></br>
</div><div>It has been a wonderful and different sort of holiday here in Jordan and I will take away with me lasting impressions. As a tourist in one week you only touch the surface of a country. Here you are taken to all the famous sites and tourists go there like sheep without seeing much else. So what else did I see you may ask? I saw a people proud of their country with photographs of the late King Hussein and his son the present King Abdullah everywhere I went and on all buildings. The royal family is much loved here but I’m not sure if that is out of respect or fear as it is a major crime to insult the King. I asked who of the two was most loved but already guessed the answer, the late King Hussein of course. To quote Sufian "the King and Queen are doing a very good job".  Queen Rania is very famous the world over but there are very few photos of her in the streets although there are some.</div><div><br></br>

</tbody></table></div><div>There are also mosques in every corner of the country.  You even find them on roadside cafés.  Once again, as in Israel, there are practically no dogs. I asked Sufian why and his answer was to do with religion and cleanliness.  Most Muslims pray 5 times a day and have to do their ablutions beforehand.  If they touch a dog it means even more hand washing, so it's easier not to have one. </div><div>What about the countryside and the cities? What did they look like? We saw a bit of everything. Jordan is mostly a desert at this time of year so everything is very dusty and dry. Houses are flat roofed and often have water tanks and solar panelling on top like in Israel. The roofs look strange though as you can see the foundations for the next story which never seems to get built. </div><div><br></br>
</div><div>The people are friendly and welcomed us everywhere and when we said we came from Spain the welcoming got even warmer and of course the conversation lead to football. The Jordanians are great fans of the Barcelona and Real Madrid football clubs and were very happy that Spain had won the world cup.</div><div><br></br>
</div><div>The cities and towns differ but are mostly a little tatty and full of rubble. The northern town of Irbid, famous for its University, looked very primitive to me whereas Aqaba looked nearly European and a lot more modern and colourful. </div><div><br></br>
</div><div>Jordan is the most peaceful of countries in the Middle East and the only one,  apart from Egypt, to have diplomatic relations with Israel. It is quite free as far as religion is concerned and the strict Muslim way of life is something more natural to its neighbours. Having said that it is also quite obvious that religion rules in Jordan. They tolerate their Jewish neighbours after the peace treaty in the 90's but still refer to the country as Palestine and not Israel.  Its immediate neighbours are Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia,  Siria and Irak.<br></br>
<br></br>
You see people dressed in both Arab and Western clothes. I would say, from what I have seen, that women in general cover their bodies and heads a lot, more  than those who don't,  but very few cover their faces. You see many Jordanians with blue eyes, something strange in this part of the world and of course the reason is the Ottoman and British heritage when apparently these invaders or "protectors" married the locals. There is segregation of sexes in the schools and homosexuality is a crime. So it’s funny to see men kissing cheeks in the street when they meet or holding hands of which there was much evidence of.   Gambling, by the way, is also prohibited.</div><div><br></br>
</div><div>Jordan has some 6 million inhabitants, 2 of whom live in Amman.  The main income comes from its phosphate mines but tourism comes a close second.  There were hoards of Spaniards, Russians, French and of course Saudis and people from all over the world, all visiting the same monuments.  Agriculture is also important.  As I said most of the Kingdom is desert but in the lush Jordan Valley all sorts of fruit and vegetables grow.  There are many banana farms here as well as date trees. One sees olive trees all over the country too and they are there for religious reasons but also of course for producing olive oil.  People can take the olives to special presses and make their own olive oil.  It is common practice.   </div><div>We loved our stay here and felt most welcome. It was wonderful to dress up as the locals do and ride horses and donkeys in Petra and travel by jeep in the desert and to experience swimming in the Dead Sea and the Red Sea all in one week. En fin a memorable holiday, one we will remember for a long time. Yesterday as we were sunbathing at the hotel beach I asked Eladio where we could go for our next exotic holiday. So where to next time? To China? To Burma, Vietnam, Africa, Australia? The world is ours and we are lucky people.</div><div><br></br>
</div><div>Goodbye Jordan, goodbye Israel, what an amazing holiday we have had.</div><div><br></br>
</div><div>Cheers till my next post from Madrid in a week’s time.</div><div><br></br>
