How are you all? I'm in fine fettle her in Santa Pola with my dear University friends, Sandra and Adele.</p><p>I came here <b>last Sunday</b> in two cars with Suzy and Eladio who were staying until they arrived on Thusday.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;While we were driving down through sunny Spain, two young men were preparing for the final of the most gruelling of the grands slams at Roland Garros in Paris. Roland Garros is a French aviation hero after which the tennis stadium was named. Its slogan is "<a href="https://www.itsagreatdayto.com/when-victory-belongs-to-the-most-tenacious/">Victory is for the most tenacious</a>" quoted by the hero but actually first used by Napoleon. Victory is for the most tenacious is what that final match turned out to be about between the world number 1, the Italian Jannik Sinner and the world number 2, Spain's Carlos Alcaraz. The match was the longest in the history of the tournament; just under 5 and a half hours. The Italian led at the beginning by two sets and I, for one, never thought "Carlitos" had it in him to make an historic comeback. But he did, once he overcame Sinner's 3 match points. I think the most surprised player was the latter who although he has won 3 grand slams, had never met Carlitos in a grand slam final nor played a match longer than 4 hours. Many people say that Alcaraz is Nadal's successor. Nadal won 14 times at Roland Garros and holds 22 grand slam titles and is considered the King of Clay.&nbsp; They both won their first Roland Garros at the same age (22). This is now Alcaraz's second French Open (plus a US Open and Wimbledon in 2023 and 2024) and for now he is the Prince of Clay. For the moment his career seems to be on the same path as his compatriot. But there the comparison ends. Carlos Alcaraz loves tennis and wants to be the best player ever but in his own way and always tries to point out that even though Nadal is his idol, he is his own man. That comes through very strongly in the Netflix documentary about him. Carlos insists he needs to party as well as work whereas the big three, Federer, Djokovic and Nadal, sacrificed their youths for tennis. So far, his plan seems to work and on Sunday he showed the world that "victory is for the most tenacious" because his tenacity and mental strength are what helped him win, as well as the public I should add. I have to confess that even though both Eladio and I were on tenterhooks during that very long match, I was unable to watch it because it made me just too tense. I remember having the same feeling watching Bjorn Bjorg and John McEnroe play Wimbledon finals. Perhaps it is more intense when watching Carlos because he is Spanish and this is my adopted country. It was the same when I watched Nadal play Federer or Djokovic, I just couldn't watch but was delighted when he won afterwards. Carlos is a boy who still lives with his family and of all the photos I saw after his second win, the one with his parents and two brothers is my favourite. BTW I also love the one of him with the ball boys and girls. How sweet of him to remember them.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzU07ybHhUKfAyGJWPHvo0K1m2IPnsMsk0FzTozMtlAlxjLEsI8m4ZQ6idmQ5bv4CGMPJas7Z_3jRnsQ1ngqY7SlVdnD7UI6czW1VenVZo8hAtY_bdaWWUuT07u-u0EREOvXoLcPWUlR3jnUxWWrsNm4sANO4wIMSWE7q_Nwedt181gKOyvcJpmw/s1638/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-06-11%20at%2019.55.34_d3aa49e1.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1638" data-original-width="1440" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzU07ybHhUKfAyGJWPHvo0K1m2IPnsMsk0FzTozMtlAlxjLEsI8m4ZQ6idmQ5bv4CGMPJas7Z_3jRnsQ1ngqY7SlVdnD7UI6czW1VenVZo8hAtY_bdaWWUuT07u-u0EREOvXoLcPWUlR3jnUxWWrsNm4sANO4wIMSWE7q_Nwedt181gKOyvcJpmw/w351-h400/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-06-11%20at%2019.55.34_d3aa49e1.jpg" width="351" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Carlos with his brothers and parents celebrating his victory last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><p>I cannot begin to imagine their pride or how they must have suffered during the match. Of course Sinner and his family will have suffered just as much but never touched the glory because after all, no one ever remembers who was number 2 and there is only ever one winner in the Men's singles in tennis. That is sad because he played brilliantly. I know, though, that he will savour the taste of success in many more Grand Slams and no doubt he will, on occasion, beat the Spaniard. If you are reading this and are not into tennis; I am sorry if I have bored you. For me watching important Grand Slams is a bit of a passion which was instilled in me as a child in England when the whole country stopped while Wimbledon was being played.&nbsp;</p><p>I did not instill this in our daughters as Wimbledon was never televised in Spain - not even when Spaniards were playing in the final (boohoo), so Suzy was a bit astonished when she saw us so stressed about the match and so happy when the Spaniard won. She was in her own little world but I think it was good that she came with us to get a bit of sun on the beach.</p><p>Last Sunday was all about tennis so let me move on to <b>Monday</b>. In the morning I enjoyed all the news clippings of Alcaraz's win in Paris but I soon had to turn my attention to more mundane matters. We had come a few days before my friends arrived with one mission, to check that everything was ok in the flat after we had had it rewired. We turned up at the electrician's "Sandro" in Santa Pola because we had not been able to get through to them on the phone which was very frustrating. To cut a long story short, we needed them to come back to the flat to put more sockets in, the details of which I won't bore you with.</p><p>After talking to the electricians and making sure they would come the next day, we went to have a coffee at my favourite cafe in town, Choco &amp; Latte, in the main square. It's one of my happy places and here is a photo of my handsome husband with little Pippa while were enjoying our time there.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiYJ9JPhL9YqIb4nA-qzd2rSlZWPFsIPf0f64Kp48rCXKPdUk_5PMZmb5yFkxXNkq3buXQrw3HaoOYkYU636DgiAVLPsxetIRg-Ga2MtcoX4TLVJmPKa9FxMaF97wfOEGLD_57gkMFaqujyrA-EUW9sZP-3ArefFyqzWZrEC0d5r2YsxWJd3t1aoA/s3436/20250609_113157(0).jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1848" data-original-width="3436" height="215" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiYJ9JPhL9YqIb4nA-qzd2rSlZWPFsIPf0f64Kp48rCXKPdUk_5PMZmb5yFkxXNkq3buXQrw3HaoOYkYU636DgiAVLPsxetIRg-Ga2MtcoX4TLVJmPKa9FxMaF97wfOEGLD_57gkMFaqujyrA-EUW9sZP-3ArefFyqzWZrEC0d5r2YsxWJd3t1aoA/w400-h215/20250609_113157(0).jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio and Pippa&nbsp; - coffee time in Santa Pola on Monday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We then had to do some food shopping which included a quick visit to Quicksave, the British supermarket across the road from the apartment. Out of interest, there I got some Yorkshire tea, some polos and bars of Imperial leather soap which I adore.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>In the afternoon or rather early evening, while Suzy was down at the pool, we went for a long walk to the Santa Pola lighthouse which takes at least an hour there and back.&nbsp; Before leaving I got Eladio to take a photo of me in the gardens belonging to the complex. I fell in love with those gardens when we&nbsp; &nbsp; bought the apartment as long ago as 1999.

They took all morning so we had to stay in the flat, apart from a quick coffee across the road with Suzy. But they did a good job and that was what we had come for.&nbsp;<br /><div><br /></div><div>So we were only really free in the afternoon to go the beach. We got there at nearly 7 pm but enjoyed a swim and a bracing walk to the end where, as always, we sat on "our rock" and contemplated our surroundings. I came home to have a shower, wash my hair and enjoy a glass of fresh white wine with Suzy on the terrace. We had a tête à tête which is always good for both of us.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Wednesday</b> came, the day of their departure. They left at around 10 am and I felt strange in the apartment by myself. It was the first time ever since we bought the flat. But I had to plenty to do to fill my time and spent the whole morning on practical errands. However, it did feel strange to be doing them on my own and not with Eladio. I even had coffee on my own which was served by a very nice man from Persia he said. His coffee was good; not so his country - his words, not mine.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I had company at lunchtime though when Gina, the lady who cleans the flat came. I had put on 3 washing loads to ease her work but I did feel a bit uncomfortable eating my left over "spag bol" on the terrace while she cleaned. She does a good job, far better than I could ever do, for sure.</div><div><br /></div><div>I spent the afternoon reading on my Kindle and writing this blog. I ate a little something while watching the news which was pretty dire this week - Greta Thunberg having to return from Israel after trying to take aid to Palestine, crack down on anti Trump protests in LA- and the awful Austrian school shooting. In Santa Pola I felt very far away from the worlds' crises and was looking forward to my friends arriving the next day.</div><div><br /></div><div>On <b>Thursday</b> I was up early as usual but was out much earlier than usual. I had to pick up Sandra from the airport off her flight from Brussels arriving at 8.30 in the morning. We would later go back to pick up Adele in the afternoon who was arriving from Nantes. Luckily the airport is a short drive from here. She was well on time and soon we were in our apartment. She was soon unpacking and handing me tantalising Belgian chocolates.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>While we were beginning our day, my 5 year old grandson, Elliot, was graduating from infant school. He was even wearing a gown and mortar board. It's funny how kids graduate with ceremonies these days at different stages of their school lives. In my day, we only graduated from University. I know, though, that it was&nbsp; a very proud day for him and his parents. Here is just 1 of the photos Oli sent to us. Isn't he gorgeous?</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj7lc3y392yGO3fFmQkWO6L5kRyDrzhFwCA3syH5r6IrTa20MpDyNmGKy2xx6hzyfE6UGHyTa-sltPInTX07DixamkpIT_IqZB8kzrcNm6SSV0v5P1WCQtMvXDsBxusDqhRXwTnfLXwxEX7p0DvLo9l5mYsCgSqQYstX-QZmztOodzUq4Zg4R-drg/s2048/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-06-13%20at%2007.25.51_0bf616a4.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img border="0" data-original-height="2048" data-original-width="1255" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj7lc3y392yGO3fFmQkWO6L5kRyDrzhFwCA3syH5r6IrTa20MpDyNmGKy2xx6hzyfE6UGHyTa-sltPInTX07DixamkpIT_IqZB8kzrcNm6SSV0v5P1WCQtMvXDsBxusDqhRXwTnfLXwxEX7p0DvLo9l5mYsCgSqQYstX-QZmztOodzUq4Zg4R-drg/s320/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-06-13%20at%2007.25.51_0bf616a4.jpg" width="196" /></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Elliot graduated from infant school</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Next term he will start at junior school and will begin homework which I'm sure he will take very seriously as he is quite competitive.<div><br /></div><div>While Sandra and I were having a cup of tea on the terrace we heard about a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner that crashed minutes after taking off from Ahmedabab on its way to Gatwick in London. On board were 242 people people&nbsp; when the plane crashed into a medical student residency.&nbsp; 1 man amazingly survived. He has a huge tale to tell. More people died on the ground and they are still looking for bodies. It was horrific and while I watched a video taken by a bystander, I could not help but remember the crash my father's family died in on landing at Rijeka airport in May 1971.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>But the big news in Spain was the unfolding of a big corruption scandal in the government that many had suspected but it was audios revealed by the Police unit investigating the case that proved beyond a doubt what happened. 3 men; an aide, Koldo, a former Minister of Transport, Abalos and Spain's number three in the cabinet, Santos Cerdán, had been taking kickbacks in exchange for awarding public contracts for a sum up to over 600.000 euros. Abalos is already been investigated as will Cerdán who stepped down yesterday. Koldos was the middle man who, cleverly I suppose, had taped all their conversations detailing the amounts of money they shared between themselves. The PM, Pedro Sánchez who had denied the allegations so far had no option now but to face the music. He did so in a press conference where he apologised profusely. He is in a shaky position and knows it. Part of his cabinet have been taking side kicks, his wife is being investigated for corruption and influence peddling and his brother is accused of using the PM's influence to get a public sector job and collecting a salary without going to work. Any of these corruption cases should be enough to bring the government down but it's not going to happen. Sanchez did not win the last elections and is propped up by a coalition government made up of separatist and communist parties. For every move he makes, he needs their approval which comes at a cost. It is said in this country that he doesn't rule, but Puigdemont, the Catalan separatist, does with his 7 votes which is a very sad state of affairs. So,&nbsp; I wonder, if what happened this week will be enough to provoke his downfall? I don't think so which is absolutely unacceptable.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Life continued, of course, in Santa Pola and at around 11.30 Sandra and I drove there to have a coffee, look at the boutiques and have lunch by the port at La Sal.

I was the only one in luck when I found some lovely blue and white cotton long trousers and some summer shoes for Eladio.<div><br /></div><div>Lunch at La Sal was enjoyable. We ate our favourite things, little green grilled peppers, prawns in garlic oil and mini scallops. Dessert - thick black cherries, was at home. I also had one of the amazing chocolates.</div><div><br /></div><div>Adele's flight was delayed by just under an hour and at around 6 we set off the airport to pick her up. It was a lovely reunion and we came back to the flat for her to unpack and for us to have our first drink of wine; actually Prosecco. Both my friends came baring gifts. Adele gave us a beautiful Indian scarf and Sandra little cotton shoulder bags which are so in fashion. Mine is yellow and I love it.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh20DUZVpjLeNfLuAOgjY1r0ZVttpbGzgSTk9bahOwup4NDF0sC7nxH1wHzJj2-46k9CH0vJA0uB_EBkrKpHv7Xe3ixMWnbhi3WFTagN5WdywBCoQbnR4Qa347H2SA3vqPuhn6Mh6xaGO4sJpa7OHSWnqyhikMHWBE5Ko7NJ1SPpqNFfVJBH5kvdg/s4000/20250613_080401.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1848" data-original-width="4000" height="185" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh20DUZVpjLeNfLuAOgjY1r0ZVttpbGzgSTk9bahOwup4NDF0sC7nxH1wHzJj2-46k9CH0vJA0uB_EBkrKpHv7Xe3ixMWnbhi3WFTagN5WdywBCoQbnR4Qa347H2SA3vqPuhn6Mh6xaGO4sJpa7OHSWnqyhikMHWBE5Ko7NJ1SPpqNFfVJBH5kvdg/w400-h185/20250613_080401.jpg" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>My yellow cotton shoulder bag</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><div><br /></div><div>It was then that my Doctor, Elena, rang me with the blood test results&nbsp; I did last week after a few months of Mounjaro, especially to see if my cholesterol had gone down. And it had, so hurray for Mounjaro my friends, even if it does take the joy out of eating, hahahaha.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>We didn't spend long on the terrace after dinner that night as we were all exhausted, especially Sandra who had got up at 3.30 to catch her flight from Brussels. I went to bed early and started rewatching a film we saw recently and that I loved. Called "El Maestro que prometió el mar" - the Teacher who promised the sea (to his pupils), it's the unknown story of Antonio Benaiges, a forward looking teacher who enamours all his pupils but enfuriates the authorities with his modern methods. This takes place in 1935 or 36 just before the Civil War. He was tortured brutally in front of his pupils and people in the village and later killed. Still today his body has not been found. It may sound gruesome but his story has to be known. It's on Netflix and I highly recommend it.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Friday</b> came, another warm but hazy day and it was ours for the taking.&nbsp; After breakfast and the news - a bit dire again as Israel has invaded Iranian nuclear installations and who knows what the retaliation will be - we went down to the beach.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>It has been hazy all week and is apparently due to forest fires in Canada. We&nbsp; took&nbsp; three chairs and as soon as were down, I was the first into the water which was divine; neither cold nor warm. What a lovely time of year to be here. We walked to the end to "our rock" where, of course we took photos like this one.</div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhZasaZxOHpIjFATMC27FsIUspWPxFOozEuXCmFWsHAYLY-syejXYwvWktuiwtO84fb_4KhvR_aEtRnUQSM-9pUMmSzJ8N98HA7fYLRZLW2GDl5E4ttXg7W-52HtFx2lO9gJoCAarNC7UQKngduOVJYr5Lgbcmytzce1nT30HBpENpHsmQLSmlAQ/s1600/IMG-20250613-WA0005.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1600" data-original-width="1200" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhZasaZxOHpIjFATMC27FsIUspWPxFOozEuXCmFWsHAYLY-syejXYwvWktuiwtO84fb_4KhvR_aEtRnUQSM-9pUMmSzJ8N98HA7fYLRZLW2GDl5E4ttXg7W-52HtFx2lO9gJoCAarNC7UQKngduOVJYr5Lgbcmytzce1nT30HBpENpHsmQLSmlAQ/s320/IMG-20250613-WA0005.jpg" width="240" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>"Our rock"</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Once back to our space on the pretty empty beach we had coffee at the beach bar which was a joy in itself. Before it got too hot we made our way home to the pool where there were hardly any people. I was keen to shower after being in the sea to get rid of all the sand before entering our pristine apartment. We all had a shower and then drove to Lidl for wine and more provisions. Lunch was a small affair after which we retired to our lovely terrace. The terrace gets the sun in the morning and the shade in the afternoon which is a blessing in the hot weather. There we played a card game called Sevens - similar to Pontoon and Adele beat us hands down.<div><br /></div><div>Friday evening was time for my weekly Mounjaro injection which my friends watched with awe and a little trepidation as they don't like needles but honestly the needle is tiny.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>We had booked a table at a restaurant across the road called Atipico which people rave about and I have never managed to go to. We loved it with a capital L I can tell you. Before going in some Italian tourists took our photos, one of which I have chosen as this week's feature photo.

But I couldn't resist some of Sandra's divine Belgian chocolates. As we got ready for bed we kept telling each other about funny memories we had of our time at University and were in hysterics. Some of it is not for writing about here I am afraid as none of us were Goody two shoes so our memories will be kept to ourselves hahaha - I will admit to one though; Cadbury creme egg eating competitions for one. Hahahahahaha.</div><div><br /></div><div>I slept so so that night and was up at 5 when I took another sleeping tablet and woke again at 7.15.
