<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; text-align: left;">Hi everyone,</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">It’s
incredible to think that this time last week I was on the train to Barcelona
for this year’s Mobile World Congress and now one week later it is all
over.  I have been working on Yoigo’s
activities there for months and now it’s over life feels very flat; as it
always does after big events.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">So let me tell
you all about it, as well as the story of the rest of the week which has been
full of activity.  I caught the 10.30
fast speed train last Sunday to Barcelona and on the train I met many
colleagues from the Spanish telecoms industry. 
My idea was to write my blog on the train but I didn’t get down to it
until nearly the end of the 2.5h journey as I was caught up talking to so many
people.  I was most delighted to find
Jesús and Renata were on the train and we had a coffee together in the bar
where we were to find many of the Spanish journalists on the way to the
Congress too.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This year’s
congress promised to be bigger than ever, with 20% more “men in black” than the
previous year, some 80.000 people.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
Mobile World Congress is the biggest telecommunications fair in the world and
Barcelona is invaded with the top brass from companies involved in the sector
from all over the world.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">This year, it
was not just about new mobile phones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S5 which was
launched on Monday.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Wearable technology,
like my Fitbit, had a huge presence here as did the social media giants
Facebook and of course the newly acquired Whatsapp.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The latter who had just acquired 19 billion
dollars from Mark Zuckerberg’s company for a business not worth more than 450
million dollars, announced it would be offering “free” voice calls on top of
its very popular instant messaging service.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Facebook too called for “free” access for customers in emerging markets.
This caused a stir from operators, including Yoigo who have pointed out that
“free” is not free as it is thanks to the huge investments operators make in
building networks that these apps work.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">So operators are supposed to invest billions of dollars on
infrastructure for companies like whatsapp or facebook to offer free services?
That makes no business sense.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">If
operators didn’t spend money on improving their networks, apps like these would
not work and people’s messages wouldn’t be sent.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It’s time to rearrange the value chain but
that’s not going to be easy.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Just
remember that “free” is never free.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Anyway, I
arrived at my hotel <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/bcndm-renaissance-barcelona-hotel/">The Renaissance Barcelona</a> near Paseo de Gracia which was to
be the headquarters of Yoigo’s mother company, TeliaSonera all week.  As soon as I had checked in I unpacked and
tried to connect to internet on the hotel’s wifi network.  It never worked and I don’t know why.  However thanks to the great 4G network Yoigo
has in Barcelona, I was able to connect using tethering (sharing my mobile
phone connection) via the “hotspot” on my iPhone.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Very soon I
was on the street again this time to catch a taxi to Badalona where my great
friend Grainne lives.  Every time I go to
Barcelona I go to see her and her son Marcel. 
She had prepared that quintessential British dish, shepherd’s pie,
except that her oven was on the blink and she had to bake it in her neighbour’s
oven.  That didn’t matter, as it was
delicious.  It was great to catch up on
her news and talk about the old days, as well as chat on the phone whilst I was
there to her sister Brenda who is a nurse and lives in Manchester. Soon I had
to leave and return to my hotel in Barcelona where I finished last week’s blog
post and published it.  The evening was
going to be busy as I had to attend two events, so I decided to have a nice
luxurious bath and rest on the bed watching the BBC World news then go out for
an hour’s walk on the to the end of the Ramblas and back before getting ready
to go out.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The news this
week has continued to be dominated by events in the Ukraine.  With the corrupt President Yanukovych on the
run, a new parliament was instated and finally the protests in the Maidan
square are over. However, nearby powerful Russia is not happy with what is
going on and it seems is getting its troops ready to enter the Crimea.  Some people think we are on the brink of a
second cold war; I hope not.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">By 21h I was
ready to go downstairs to join my colleagues at the TeliaSonera get together
which was taking place in the bar of our hotel. 
It was good to greet Anna, Linda, Ingrid, Philip, Urban, Peter, Salomon,
Soren, Mette and many other colleagues. 
Just when Anna was making her welcoming speech in walked my old boss
Johan who no longer works for the company. 
It was wonderful to see him again as it always is.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I had to leave
soon to go to another party. It was for Spanish press and hosted by
Samsung.  However I hardly knew anyone
and it seemed the place was full of local bloggers so I decided to leave nearly
as soon as I had arrived. <o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">I got back to
my hotel and started communicating with Eladio on whatsapp! who was watching
our favourite programme of the week “Salvados” presented by the a Spanish
journalist, Jordi Evole, who is hugely popular in Spain for probing into issues
that are largely controversial.  He had
promised to broadcast a documentary on the Spanish coup (23F) in 1981 claiming
he would “rewrite” the history books.  So
some 5 million viewers were stunned to hear that the “operation palace”
revealed that the coup itself and the king’s speech had apparently been staged by
the Government to save democracy and boost the king’s image.  At the end of the report, Jordi Evole
revealed it had been a <a href="http://www.thelocal.es/20140224/fake-coup-film">false documentary</a> and that he had done it to prove to
viewers how television can manipulate spectators. Everyone was shocked, me too
and felt confused as an audience to have been duped this way. When I spoke to
Olivia about it this week, she calmly answered “oh but he just did a
“mockumentary”, a TV format that has been used before.  Of course she is right, but maybe in Spain we
have never been confronted with anything similar.  The first “mockumentary” was the famous Orson
Welles “panic” broadcast, The War of the Worlds.  I for one had never heard the term
“mockumentary” and if you didn’t know it either, now you know.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Monday I
decided to have breakfast in bed as I did every morning whilst in Barcelona,
preferring to enjoy my favourite meal in my room rather than in the dining room
with colleagues.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Right across
the way was the Ford stand and here I enjoyed a short chat with Gustavo who now
works for their external communications agency.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">He used to head up my team at Ketchum and I still miss him.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Next I met up with Julio, my great friend and
ex Nokia colleague and we escaped the hugeness of the exhibition to go and have
lunch in town.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It took nearly 40 minutes
in the taxi to Plaza de la Villa by the harbour. Getting to the exhibition and
back is always a big problem as there are never enough taxis for 80.000 people
going to and leaving the fair.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">One night
a colleague of mine, Linda, told me it took her 2 hours to return to her
hotel!</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Luckily I never had to go to the
congress at peak times which is always a nightmare. Julio and I enjoyed lunch
at Cal Pinxo after which I walked all the way back to my hotel where I needed a
rest before venturing out for another long walk and coming back to get ready to
go to my own party.</span></div>

host a Yoigo party for our partners, collaborators, shop keepers, press and

I get to see so many people I know and have worked with for years.  I was especially happy to see my ex

Nokia; Juana, Julio, Paloma, Cristina, Miquel, Marc, Pepe, Carlos and Pepe.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

unobtrusively just past midnight.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We had good
news that day from Suzy.  She has been
made a fixed employee with her company and will now be working full time as a
fully-fledged employee as the operations and catering manager at Oxo which is
owned by the Concerto Group.  At the same
time she had bad news in that the flat in Aldgate fell through as the current
tenant decided to carry on living there. 
In a way I’m not that upset as I think it was going to be too small with
no living area for “us visitors”.  So now
she and Gabor are looking for a flat to share with other people and are using
what is a called a “buddy up” option to find one.  So watch this space.  I do hope they find something suitable soon
and can move out of their ghastly accommodation in Whitechapel which they share
with 12 people!<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Tuesday
morning I was up at 06.30 as I had to be at the TeliaSonera press conference
starting early that morning at a hotel opposite the congress.  I slept badly that night despite a
comfortable bed, as I have been sleeping badly for about 10 days now.  The record according to my fitbit was waking
up 10 times one night this weekend. 
Apart from being stressed with the events I was to execute at the
congress I was plagued with a nasty cold and cough which probably contributed
to the bad nights.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The
TeliaSonera press conference hosted by the new CEO, another Johan, Johan D,
went well and the room was quite full of Nordic journalists.  There was no breaking news, more an overview
of the company.  I was delighted to see
the first slide about Yoigo which was entitled: “Proud owners of the challenger
Yoigo in Spain”, which in fact I had contributed to.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Not long after
the press conference I had another press engagement; an interview by Expansión,
Spain’s leading business daily, with the CEO of TeliaSonera.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It was my job to translate which wasn’t easy
I can tell you.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It never is and all
depends, in my case, on how long the sentences are.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I was exhausted when it was over and in need
of rest, but I had to have a meeting with my boss about our press conference
the next day.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">My next
appointment was a lovely lunch at <a href="http://www.neichel.es/en/">Neichel</a> with the girls from my events agency,
Cristina and Gloria and also with Miguel, the only guy who works at
QuintaEsencia. It was great to get away from the busy exhibition and wind down
after the morning’s stressful activities.

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">In the
afternoon I was quietly working in my room when I saw breaking news on Reuters
about Yoigo.  After our interview it
seems the CEO of TeliaSonera was interviewed by the international news agency.  The problem was it quoted him saying that
Yoigo was too small to compete in the Spanish market.  What it didn’t say and apparently he had
actually said was that the Mother company was happy to carry on growing Yoigo
in Spain.  This of course would have
repercussions in our own press conference the next day when we would get
questions, once again, on the future of Yoigo. 
I was not happy. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">That evening
we had our traditional end of congress dinner for my teams at our press agency,
Ketchum, and our events agency, QuintaEsencia. 
We commented on the Reuters article during our dinner at La Venta at the
top of Barcelona but soon wound down and talked about other things.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Wednesday
morning I was up early.  I had to have
breakfast, pack and be at our press conference venue, <a href="http://www.casapaloma.es/">Casa Paloma</a>, by 9.  The address on the invitation was 29 Carrer
de Casanova but when I arrived I just couldn’t see the venue.  It turned out to be on Carrer de Casanova 209,
not 29.  There was a moment of panic when
we had to alert journalists to the fact. 
Thankfully they were all warned and turned up ok at the venue.  <o:p></o:p></span></div>

mobile phones, similar to car leasing.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> 
</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We also announced 4G roaming in Spain for TeliaSonera customers from
Norway and Sweden and more interestingly for our own customers, a new system of
accessing premium services to avoid shock bills from these shark like companies
who dupe people into signing up to fraud services.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The sweetest
moment for me of the Mobile World Congress was relishing the headlines of media
coverage after the Yoigo press conference on my mobile phone and PC on the
train going back. It is the reward for all the effort I had put into organizing
our activities at the congress; some 150 articles mainly online.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">So, I could come home feeling pleased if not

brilliant sunshine in Madrid.  I also
came home to visitors. Phil and Kathy, our friends from Keighley in Yorkshire
had come to stay for a few days and had arrived the day before me.  Believe it or not they were sunbathing by our
covered pool.  So after greeting them and
unpacking I went to join them, over a lovely cup of tea.  Eladio went off to this UNED University tutorial
and the three of us went for “our” walk. It was a beautiful evening and a great
way to wind down after the stress of Barcelona.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

that lovely medieval city which has a famous Roman aqueduct.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We were to have lunch at the equally famous
</span><a href="http://www.mesondecandido.es/ingles.html" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Mesón de Cándido</a><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> and I had asked my ex cyclist friend Pedro Delgado to book us

scenic way, over the mountains rather than on the motorway.  I was eager  
to show my friends the snow there but was not sure if there would be
any.  We were in for a surprise as the
snow was piled up and there was nearly a blizzard when we arrived at the Puerto
de Navacerrda (mountain pass) where people from Madrid go skiing. Who could
believe that there could be so much snow just 50km from Madrid when our friends
had been sunbathing the day before? The mountain pass is 1858 metres high and
the highest mountain in the Guadarrama mountain region is Peñalara which is
nearly 2.500 metres high.  I can only
imagine that’s quite a lot for them as the highest mountain in England, Snowden
is just 1.085 metres.  It felt like we
were in Siberia not in sunny Spain.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

go and have a cup of coffee.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In fact we

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Friday was
Kathy and Phil’s last day with us so it was fitting we took them to Madrid.
They wanted a walk in the Retiro Park and a visit to the Plaza Mayor.  We drove into Madrid and found it difficult
to park by the Retiro so Eladio left us in the street and went off to
park.  We presumed he would come back for
us but he didn’t. He had us stranded in the street ringing him to no
avail.  Finally he picked up the phone
and told me he was already in the park by the lake and had thought we would
make our way there.  That is my Eladio
always presuming things that have not been agreed.  So off we went to meet him.  I have to admit I was a little cross but had
to shrug off the feeling as it was such a lovely day and I wanted to enjoy the
beautiful ornamental park with our friends. 
The Retiro is Madrid’s biggest park and was built in the 16<sup>th</sup>
century by the Royal Family.  It became a
public park in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century. <o:p></o:p></span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">We were
approached by a fortune telling gypsy and as I was now in a good mood I got
trapped with her blarney.  For 10 or so
euros she told me I was a person who liked to earn money and spend it, that my
husband loved me but another man pined for me and that I would have two
grandchildren.  Kathy got ensnared too
and was told nearly the same things; so she was obviously making everything
up.  However it was a bit of fun and
added colour to the day.<o:p></o:p></span></div>

children and sent them as far away as America and made them work for years to
“pay” for their stay at these cruel residences.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></div>
