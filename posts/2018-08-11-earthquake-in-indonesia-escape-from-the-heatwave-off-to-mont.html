<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Good morning everyone.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">This week finds me in our beloved village Montrondo and in our lovely new house which in October turns 3. We love it here and enjoy this house tremendously, the only one we have ever built. The walls are those of the house Eladio was born in; just the walls as everything else was rotten and we had to build it from scratch which took nearly 2 years but now we have it for life to enjoy.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Last Sunday we were still in Madrid suffering the heat wave. I shall never forget the 42ªc it reached that weekend, the hottest I have ever known it where we live. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">That day, Nicolas Maduro, the President of Venezuela who rules the country with an iron fist, suffered an attack on his life. He survived a rather crude <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-45073385">drone explosive attack</a> while in a public gathering. He blamed the US and Colombia and later in the week detained a political opposition leader for the attack on his life. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">That was headline news, after all it's not every day there is an assassination attempt on a government leader's life. It also shows how vulnerable they are or he is. Certainly using a drone to try and kill someone is a new type of killing weapon and I don't like it. New technology should be for good not for bad in my mind. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">After making lunch that day, Oli and I had some quality time together. It was nice to have her back. We went out on a few errands and then had a coffee at Alverán in Boadilla. It was there we video whatsapped Suzy. We had a lovely chat. Later in the day she warned us there had been an <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-45076800">earthquake in the nearby island of Lambok</a>, so near from Bali. </span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">More than 300 have died after the magnitude 6.9 struck. It was the 3rd quake since she went to live there. Apparently there are over 7000 tremors a year in the area and people live with earthquake warnings often but Sunday's was particularly strong. My daughter told us she was riding her scooter when it happened and even though she didn't notice the tremor, she saw people running out on the streets and shouting in fear. It must have been awful. It certainly sent tremors down my spine. Earthquakes are no joke and Suzy has been lucky so far. I am praying there will not be another one while she is in Bali. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Monday would find her in Singapore on a day trip there to renew her Indonesian visa for a further 6 months. It must have been tiring as it's a 2.5h flight, a bit like flying to London from Madrid so not that near. The alternative was Malaysia which is even further. She left on Sunday our time I think and got there while we were sleeping. Her mission turned out to be successful although it must have put her out of pocket for a while. She told us she has been giving nutrition sessions so is earning something and that she intends to teach English online for more income. That is thanks to my dear friend Jacky. Thank you darling. And here she is with her coveted visa. Suzy is happy living her funny new life in Indonesia and that for me is what matters. Go for it Suzy. Love you.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">From Alverán, Oli and I drove to Carrefour market to get some provisions to take to Montrondo on Monday and to make sure there was enough in the cupboards for my Father and Lucy while we were away.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Again in the afternoon we installed ourselves on our beach chairs in the shade under the trees in the garden, leaving the pool to our French Airbnb family. It was still very hot reaching 39ºc that day, a little less than the 42ºc on Friday. It had reached 46ºc in some parts of Spain and a total of 4 people died as a consequence. Later I heard the figure just in Catalonia was 11! Most of Europe last weekend was suffering the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45070498">heatwave </a>which we would escape when we came to Montrondo on Monday. </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We were joined by the dogs and soon by the little French girl, Marian who has just turned 8 and is so sweet and pretty. She loves the dogs, Elsa and Norah but we have to keep Pippa away from her. My little dachshund does not like children and there is nothing I can do. Marian sat with Elsa and spoke to Oli and I in her perfect French and the two of us did our best to understand and reply. She told us she wanted to be a vet when she grew up which didn't surprise us. She also told us she adores her brother Clement, that her Mother is a teacher of history and geography and that her Father works in a bank or for a bank. Jerome came down to join us a bit worried his daughter was being a nuisance but we loved her. He explained that his was a "modern family", he being the father of 5 siblings from 3 different mothers, little Marian being the youngest and whom he had with his current partner. We also learned that Clement is Peggy's son from her previous marriage or partnership. Indeed they are a "modern family". We felt practically like dinosaurs as we have been married for 35 years and both are girls were born inside our marriage.  </span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We all read our books in the shade. My latest book was "<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Night-Penguin-Modern-Classics-Wiesel/dp/0141038993/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=YEM9GTXAVWKYA222GBN4">Night"</a> by the Auschwitz survivor, a Hasidic Jew, Elie Wiesel, who died in 2016. I heard about his book when there was news of his former home in Romania having been vandalised with anti-Semitic graffiti. How sad. What a story by the way. He was an amazing man. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">On a much happier note, that afternoon, far away in India, the 25 year old Spanish badminton player from Huelva, Carolina Marín, won her </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/badminton/45074676" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">third world championship</a><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"> being the first person ever to do so.

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We coincided with our French family while making dinner on Sunday night. They are lovely people. Jerome told me he was born in Casablanca where his Father taught French to Moroccans and that he was later transferred to a school in Normandy. He told me it was a huge culture shock to move from Casablanca to northern France when he was just 15. I chatted to his wife Peggy, the teacher of French and Geography and who speaks great English and told her that history had been my favourite subject at school, especially the French Revolution and Napoleon. I had a great history teacher at St. Joseph's College, Miss Scorer, who I will always remember. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Oli and I were making "Spanish tortilla" and Peggy and her family were interested to know how to make it. That got me thinking that maybe I should offer Spanish cooking lessons as part of my Airbnb business where you can also sell experiences. I am even thinking of getting Eladio on board to teach our guests Spanish. Jerome is learning Spanish and our English family were interested too so maybe there is a market for it haha. There you have me, always on the lookout on new ways to find income. This, by the way, was the tortilla we made to which I added a bit of spinach. Adding anything but potato and onions is not very orthodox but I can tell you it tasted great. </span></div>

As usual we stopped at Rueda at the Palacio de Bornos for a well deserved glass of local white wine; "verdejo" for me and "sauvignan" for Eladio. We had it with a plate of ham which would be our lunch.  Just as we arrived at the "bodega", a picturesque flock of sheep was crossing the road and I had to get a photo.

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We got to Montrondo at around 5 and found it sunny and warm and about 30ºc - it would go down over the following days. Eladio had left everything clean and tidy since his stay here a few days ago and we soon settled in. </span></div>
<br></br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Pippa and I spent time outside on the sunbeds under the shade of the apple trees where I continued reading my book, "Night". Eladio joined me shortly and we had our own kind of afternoon tea, fruit with nuts on our cool back terrace. It was nice to see Miguel and Claudia who came to visit us. We hadn't seen them since last year and were keen to know how life was for them in Cuba. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"></span><br></br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I made a light lunch of "lacón" with asparagus followed by melon and cherries after which we watched another episode of "Fariña". It was early to bed for us that night. In Montrondo we sleep under a heavy duty duvet, unlike a simple sheet and air conditioning in Madrid. What a difference in temperature and how happy we were to have escaped the heatwave.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">On Tuesday the temperature in Montrondo dropped by about 10º. That was fine by me. We missed our walk that morning as we had to wait for the central heating oil to be delivered. So I read on the sunbed after some household chores; cooking and ironing. That day I made a much loved Portuguese <a href="https://www.finedininglovers.com/recipes/main-course/bacalhau-a-bras-recipe/">cod recipe "bacalhau a bras</a>" which Eladio and I devoured. If you are interested, this is the recipe I use and it is "easy peasy" to follow and make. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Lunch was followed by the 3 o'clock news as always. That day the news was about wild fires in Spain, the main one being in Lluxent in the province of Valencia. But far worse was the wild fire in California. A siesta was in order afterwards. Meanwhile, Oli and Miguel were on their way here. They arrived at around 5 pm to find us once again reading on the sunbeds, our favourite place here in the summer. It was lovely to see them and to have their company for a few days here. </span></div>
<br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"></span><br></br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Eladio had invited an old school friend from the village, José Manuel and his Sevillian wife, Pepi, for coffee at 7 pm. Being a bit late for coffee, Olivia and I also served cider, shandy, black cherries, chorizo and whatever we thought they might like at that time of the day. After 7 pm here it gets cold and sitting on our back terrace soon we were all wearing fleeces; unimaginable in Madrid hahaha. </span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Dinner was late on Tuesday. I can't remember what we ate but I can remember what we drank; the bottle of French white wine from the Loire Valley our Airbnb guests had brought us. Later the 4 of us watched Fariña which Miguel and Oli were hooked on too.</span></div>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">On Wednesday I was up late for me at 7.15. That would be the norm here which was a nice relief. I had my coffee alone with Pippa, read the "papers" on my iPad and even ironed before everyone else was up. I made them all breakfast, my favourite meal of the day.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Finally that morning we got our walk, our first since Sunday. It was a long one to Senra and back, made longer by stopping to talk to villagers. It was a lovely sunny day but later it would rain. Oh rain, I haven't seen any for ages. We walked to Senra where we had the usual coffee at Cumbres de Omaña. Once there we went to buy bread at the very old bakery which according to Eladio has not changed since he was a little boy. And here are MIguel and Oli with Pipps holding the 2 big loaves we bought.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">After siesta time, we spent more time in the garden which we call "la era". It was getting cooler and soon we went inside. It then started to rain and my what a strong shower although it didn't last long. Miguel, Oli and I spent the time eating biscuits, drinking tea and playing games; ludo and trivial. Amazingly I won both. I have never won trivial before and I had hard competition with Oli's boyfriend although I think it was more luck with the dice than anything else. </span></div>

I couldn't believe it and was over the moon they were together. You see I love Katty as if she was a sister even though I am more her aunt. The two of them had planned the visit and wanted to surprise me. Well they certainly did surprise me. I sort of wish they had told me well on time and then maybe I would have done the crazy thing and gone out to join them. Here they are like two peas in a pod.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Thursday was the day of our day trip to Oviedo. Oviedo is the capital of the province of Asturias in the north west of Spain, just 1.5h from here. It's a relatively small old town with a population of about 220.000  but with a lot of history and charm. The famous Spanish statesman and writer Campomanes is from here as well as the  author Leopoldo Alas Clarin. Clarín really put Oviedo on the map with his novel "La Regenta" and also gave the town another name, "Vetusta" in this well known book.  Vetusta means old, antiquated and also conservative and has become a synonym of the city. Woody Allen also put Oviedo on the map in his film Maria Cristina Barcelona and apparently loves the city. There is a statue of him in one of the squares and  talk now of removing it after the accusations of his sexual wrongdoings. When we saw it we did not take a photo for this very reason. Of interest are the old town, the beautiful squares, the late Gothic cathedral, the Foldán indoor market which is a jewel, as well as the theatre, "Teatro Campoamor" and also the beautiful 5 star hotel La Reconquista where I would love to stay one day. Asturias, actually a "principado" (principality) as the heir to the throne in Spain is always the Príncipe de Asturias, is a beautiful province with some of the best food in the country owing to its Atlantic coast and mountainous regions. The best cider in Spain comes from here and as you will read there is a peculiar way of pouring it to get the most sparkle, called "escanciar" and the waiters in the local bars pour it over a device called "no me chisques" (don't splash). We were to drink lots of local cider on Thursday.  </span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Asturias is the rainiest part of Spain and Thursday didn't disappoint. Oviedo was the coldest provincial capital that day with temperatures between 18 and 20ºc, thus we went well wrapped up and even wore coats!  We drove via the motorway but would come back the via the mountain roads which were much more picturesque. By about 12 am we parked just outside the centre and walked from there to the old town. In need of a coffee, we went in search of the nearest bar we could find and sat in the cool weather and slight rain. Here are Eladio and I enjoying the beginning of our day out. I should add it was a first for us, as we never venture from Montrondo other than to do the main shopping in Villablino. I had been to Oviedo before but many years ago in the Tour of Spain and my memory was hazy. So that day I was to rediscover the beautiful town of Oviedo also full of very interesting statues which I loved.  There are about 100 dotted all over the town which make it like an open air museum. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">It was lunch time when we left the market and we had a table booked at a place Miguel had found on Tripadvisor, "El gato negro".  It was actually a typical "sidrería" (cider bar). However, as we had Pippa with us, we had to ask for a table outside and thus had to wait quite a while to sit down and taste the local fare. While we waited we all enjoyed the local cider and a small tapa. Finally we got our table outside under the parasols which was a good thing as it was raining lightly. The food was great and we all tasted the Asturian "fabes" (habas in Spanish, broad beans in English). I had the typical Asturian bean stew "fabada" and Miguel had another typical dish called "cachopo" which is really a huge breaded piece of steak with cheese which comes with an enormous amount of chips. </span></div>

Badminton is not a well known game in Spain although that is changing thanks to Carolina Marín the Spanish three time world champion. But I well remember playing it at school and at the local church and always liked it. Here are Miguel and Olivia playing.

She also introduced us to her new boyfriend during the call and we got to see Dous I think his name is. He is Indonesian and plays the drums in the band she sings in. If she's happy, I'm happy. She looked it too and I took a screenshot of the call to share with you here. Later in the day she booked her flight to come home for Christmas.

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">On Saturday Oli and Miguel were going away to Gijon, the big coastal town in Asturias to stay with a colleague of Miguel's. They will be back today. Eladio and I decided to go for a trek up the mountains with Pippa and to take a picnic. Eladio wanted to show me the "Boz Quemao" valley high up in the mountains and I was keen for a day out walking. So I packed our picnic which we carried in an old Nokia ruck sack. We left at just after 11 am and were not back until about 4.30 pm. It was a long hard walk in the sun and we were grateful for the many water springs on our way up, like this one, "la canalina". Every nook and cranny in this area has a name, hahaha and after so many years being married to a man from this village they are all now quite familiar to me.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; text-align: justify;">I wish I knew how many kilometres we walked yesterday but I don't as I lost my fitbit in France and forgot about turning on one of the health apps on my phone. Eladio reckoned we had done between 12 and 15 but they were tough ones as the terrain is difficult with lots of stones and water to get across, not to mention just how steep some of the paths are. At about 1.30 we got to "Boz Quemao". meaning</span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif; text-align: justify;"> "burnt wood" (bosque quemado in Spanish) which is really just a big meadow. It means a lot to Eladio as this is where in the summer he and his family used to cut the grass and turn it into haystacks for their cattle. When he was little, his job was to walk up the mountains to take his Father his lunch. </span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I was too tired and hot to carry on so we turned back to find somewhere near water to have our picnic. We also had to find a place in the shade which wasn't easy yesterday. All three of us were hungry and enjoyed our ham and tomato sandwiches. I had even made a mini one for Pippa. After a good rest in the shade and more water from the nearby spring, we set off down the mountain path again which would take us at least another 2 hours. We came home dirty, tired but happy and all dying for a shower. Well, Pippa wasn't dying for hers but she was the first to have her bath hahaha. We all felt a lot better afterwards. </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">With the house and garden to ourselves, I did the washing, hung it out, wrote a bit of this blog and then joined Eladio on the sunbeds outside and started on my new book, "Fariña". We had an early dinner, tuna fish salad, then watched the news. Both of us fell asleep really early in front of the television and I think we turned in before 10 pm.</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">This morning after a long night tossing and turning, I woke up at 6.30 to a quiet and dark house. It only gets light here at this time of year at about 7.30. On the plus side the sun sets at 9.30 pm. </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Today I shall be making "cocido" stew for lunch and Oli and Miguel will be back. It looks like we will have similar weather to yesterday, warm and sunny so I look forward to a nice and quiet Sunday with my family. We shall be going back to Madrid either tomorrow or on Tuesday. We can't stay away much longer than a week and tomorrow we will have been here for 7 days.</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Wishing you all a great Sunday and week ahead, I shall sign off now until next week.</span><br></br>
