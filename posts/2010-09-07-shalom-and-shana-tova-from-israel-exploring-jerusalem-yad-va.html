Shalom my friends!</div><div class="MsoNormal">Shalom is the word Israelis use to greet each other here. These days, though they are also saying Shana Tova because it is Rosh Hashanah (New Year) tomorrow. The Arabs on the other hand usually say Salam Alekam to greet each other and they are celebrating Ramadan. During the time the sun is out, practising Muslims may not eat, drink, smoke or have sex.  I have made a couple of Arab friends at a little shop selling water in Jaffa Gate and caught one of them smoking.  He shamefully admitted his Mother would not be happy.</div><div class="MsoNormal">Well this is our 4<sup>th</sup> day in Jerusalem and time to write my blog about our time here before we move on to Nazareth in Galilee tomorrow for the second stage of our trip to Israel.  Tourism is hard work in the heat and it has been hot.  To get to know Jerusalem, frankly you have to be fit because it’s all about walking and walking and walking on old stone streets and up and down old stone steps and getting lost in the process.  We take our map with us every day but I must admit neither of us are good map readers.  So you end up asking people the way and getting lost.  Young children try to show you the way for a few coins.  Everyone in fact wants your business, just as they did in India and they do in Turkey and many other tourist spots of the world.   There are many tourists here but not as many as the local businesses would like because of fear of coming here or that’s what one shop dealer told me.  Eladio and I stick out like sore thumbs and we are approached all the time by shop dealers and taxi drivers mostly.  They all try to rip us off.  We haggle but I’m sure they still make a profit.  I was told yesterday after haggling over the price of a necklace for Olivia: “you are nice but you are hard”.  Also I seem to have made a huge hit with the local men as they are always telling Eladio what a lucky man he is.  I’m not sure if it is a compliment or a way of enticing us to buy from them.  Whatever the case I do feel flattered at my age.  Today I asked one of my admirers what the reason was and his said it was because of the way I looked and smiled and the jewellery I wore, that I looked like I was “someone”.  </div><div class="MsoNormal">The old city is divided into 4 quarters, the Armeninan, the Jewish, the Arab and the Christian.  There are some 2.000 Armenians, 4.000 Jews, 2.000 Christians and 27.000 Arabs, according to our guide on the Free Tour we took on Sunday.  I like the story of how the Armenians came to live here.  As a nation they were apparently one of the first to embrace Christianity. When the Crusaders who came here and killed off all the local women, wanted to stay, they realised they needed women and thus they imported them from Armenia or so the story goes.  I have always heard from my Father that the Armenians are the cleverest people in the world and wonder whilst I am here if that is true.  My only reference point is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calouste_Gulbenkian">Calouste Gulbenkian</a>, the famous philanthropist who is of Armenian origin and was certainly clever so maybe my Father’s theory is correct.  In the Armenian Quarter we patronised the well known Armenian Tavern for dinner last night.  The place is really quaint and beautiful but the food was not as good as we expected.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></br>

The Orthodox Jews stick out amongst all the rest for their way of dressing, hair style and head gear.  They are like a clan and look more different than anyone else. Also I have noticed they never look you in the eye.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></br>

In a way I am following in his footsteps but not for the same reasons as my objectives here are more cultural or are they?  I have mixed feelings visiting all these holy places, the Christian ones of course.  But then again I was was baptised in the Russian Orthodox church (in Paris for the records), brought up at a Catholic school, and studied Religion A level as well as doing Theology subsidiary at Nottingham University.  So there is a lot of religious heritage in me, not to mention the fact that both my grandfathers were priests and that I even married one!  Therefore I could not help but light candles at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre for my darling Mother, golden brother George and my dearest Aunt Masha as well as shed a tear for them whilst doing so.  Does that mean I believe?  Well I don’t know.</div><div class="MsoNormal"><br></br>

</tbody></table></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Bethlehem was nothing like the image you conjure up in your mind when you sing Christmas carols.  It is dirty, untidy, dusty and there has probably been no street planning since Jesus was born.  But of course it is extremely interesting to visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Nativity">Church of the Nativity </a>and see the spot where Jesus was born.  You go through the door of humility called so because it is low and you have to bend your body to go through.  I think the original enrtrance was actualy for animals, but even so. The church has 3 parts, one run by the Armenian Orthodox, one run by the Green Orthodox and one run by the Catholics.  Underneath the church is the crypt which is run by the three churches and it is here you can touch and photograph both the star that represents where Jesus was born and the manger where he laid.  The star has 14 points to symbolise the 14 Stations of the Cross.  Unfortunately Eladio was not very well and we had to come back to the Guest House in a rush, much to the disappointment of the “free” guide provided by our Jordanian taxi driver, who wanted to take us to some special souvenir shop.  We are quite seasoned travellers however and have a smell for when the guides and taxi drivers are in cahoots with local business so probably wouldn’t have gone with him anyhow.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span><br></br>

</tbody></table></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>So much culture and religion made us hungry today and just as we were on our way to Jaffa Gate or somewhere we could find a bite, a taxi driver stopped and offered to take us to a nice Israeli restaurant.  Our mistake was not to agree a price.  He turned out to be a Russian Jew and told me there were a million Russians in Israel! He was not a nice character and demanded quite a lot of money.  Eladio handed him a big enough note and said he would pay no more, threatening to call the police. It was a tense and tough moment until he drove away in a rage.  We were so worried we decided not to go to the restaurant he recommended in case he came back.  Instead we found a jewel of a place called <a href="http://joy.rest-e.co.il/">Joy</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emek_Refaim">Emek Rafaim Street i</a>n the German Colony near our Guest House which served great Kosher food including gazpacho (nothing like ours of course) and something wonderful called Moroccan cigars which are a sort of mini spring roll filled with lamb.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Our time in Jerusalem ended this evening with a wonderful walk around the so-called “golden walls”.  They are actually made of white stone (lime stone) as are all the buildings in Jerusalem and surroundings.  It’s funny and rather nice not to see the proverbial red brick. It’s sad to leave somewhere so special and to think you may never come again.  On the other hand if I think positively I should realise just how lucky and privileged I have been to come to the holy city of Jerusalem, so disputed by all religions and where so many people would love to come and can’t.  Goodbye Jerusalem, Shalom. You see shalom also means goodbye.  The irony of it is that shalom actually means peace.  So yes, I wish peace to Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Shalom my friends from Jerusalem.</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span>Masha</span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span></span></div><div class="MsoNormal"><span></span></div>
