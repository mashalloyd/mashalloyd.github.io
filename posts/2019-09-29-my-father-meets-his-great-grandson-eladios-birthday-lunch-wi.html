<div style="text-align: justify;">
Dear all</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
We are now into Elliot's second week in this world and again this blog and many future posts will be "all about Elliot" as he is now the centre of our universe. Oli and Miguel are living in Elliot land at the moment, so concentrated are they on him they aren't following much of the news around them. I remember such times when Suzy was first born and the first month is like living in a cocoon or a bubble. We are part of that bubble I am happy to say and last Sunday Oli and Miguel  brought their newborn baby to our house for his first visit here. Hopefully it will be the first of very many as we cannot get enough of him.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
After our walk, Suzy and I went to do some shopping for the family lunch and then I spent the next hour or so cooking. For the record I made meat loaf with home made tomato sauce and accompanied with pumpkin and potato pure. While we were cooking my friend Juana came to see us to drop off the perhaps the most beautiful present Elliot and Oli were to receive, a home made baby hamper made by my friend. A lot of the products were from Zara Home and Olivia loved them. This is it.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
It was lovely to see Juana and such a beautiful gesture. We are ex Nokia friends and our friendship goes back quite a few years, since 2000 when I first joined the Finnish company, It was a pity Oli wasn't home when Juana came but no doubt there will be other occasions. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Meanwhile Oli, Miguel and little Elliot left their house for the first time since his birth as they had an appointment with the gynecologist at the hospital where he was born. Oli was pretty ravaged from the birth which was a very long and difficult one and needed examining. No doubt it will take some time for her to recover completely. On paper maternity is a rather glamorous state but in reality it can be very different.  </div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
It was Elliot's first outing and he behaved beautifully all day. Basically he was peaceful and slept throughout. He had fed at 10.30 and was not fed again until well after lunch allowing his mother to eat. My father was to meet his great grandson for the first time in the flesh. I had showed him all the photos and I knew he was dying to see him. He said he was a beautiful baby and wished him a healthy, happy and constructive life. I liked his wish for a constructive life. We then had the photo taken which illustrates this post and what a photo it is. 4 generations together: the great grandfather, the grandmother, the aunt, the mother and her baby. To think my father is 100 years old and his great grandson is just days old.  Obviously this is the photo of the week or possibly the photo of the year and that's why I have chosen it as the feature photo of this post. And what a year we have had; my father turning 100, Suzy coming to stay from May to October and Elliot being born as well as the year of my book which has been one of the most important projects of my life. My most important project now is to be the best grandmother possible for little Elliot.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I was a little apprehensive about the dogs' reactions to my grandson, especially Pippa's as she doesn't like children and usually barks her head off. However, I think she must have realised instinctively that he is family and she was not worried at all, nor did she bark or try to jump up at the baby. Even so I kept a close eye on her. Poor Pips has now taken second place after Elliot but I am making up for that by treating her extra specially.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
After lunch it was time for Elliot's feed so we all followed Oli up to her room to watch the spectacle because that is what it is for us. I caught Oli, the baby and Suzy and Eladio looking on and got this lovely photo.</div>

After his long feeding time, Elliiot went to sleep again. Suzy put him into his cot in Oli's room, a second cot they inherited and he went straight to sleep. Look how his Aunt prepared him for his nap:</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Once asleep that meant both Oli and Miguel could catch up on theirs and we left them to it. They were in dire need of a few hours of slumber and that's what they got.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
In the early evening I sent them off for a walk as Oli has been prescribed lots of walks by her doctor which she does very slowly because of the stitches. Thus I was left in charge to baby sit my grandson. I did this with enormous joy and Suzy and I took turns to hold him. He loves being held in arms.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I later made our dinner while Suzy who can't keep her eyes off her darling nephew held him. We could have put him in his luxury pram but preferred to hold him. It was lovely to have Oli and Miguel with us for dinner and I had hoped they would stay the night so as to celebrate Eladio's birthday the next morning for breakfast but they had to go home for various logistical reasons. We would however see them on Eladio's birthday as we would celebrate it with them at dinner the next night. I didn't want to see Elliot leave but was comforted that I would see him again the next day.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
We went to bed late. Eladio and I started watching Patriot on Netflix but it's not our thing.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I was awake at 7 am on Monday, Eladio's 75th birthday. How could he possibly be turning 75 I thought? I have known him now for 40 years as we met when he was 35 (I was 23). No way does he look it I can tell you but I'm sure he doesn't like the clock ticking so fast in his latter years. Neither do I. On the other hand, if we didn't celebrate birthdays we wouldn't be here and here we are. For once we didn't have a birthday breakfast as that would have been too much food. Of course, though, we made up for it at lunch and at dinner.<br></br>
<br></br>
The day started with a walk. That day would be Elliot's first walk too, in his pram that is. It was a sunny day and Olivia and Miguel look as pleased as punch in a selfie he sent me. I was pleased for them. Oli says he is a little saint by day and a little devil at night. At night he keeps them awake and the "fiesta" starts and all he wants to do is feed and if he isn't at her breast he cries. They have had lots of sleepless nights this week poor things. He is at his most calm when he has skin contact. Thus he now sleeps with his parents in bed. It's not the ideal situation but if that's the only way he will sleep then it has to be. Here is a photo of the three of them in bed. It looks like a poster for a funny family film. hahaha.<br></br>

The best moment was when we brought in the cake, or rather when we ate it as it was delicious. Covered in white chocolate it is made of sponge, lots of whipped cream and fruit. It is our favourite and we buy it from a cake shop in Boadilla called Alverán. Here is Eladio just after he blew out the candles.<br></br>

As you can see Eladio was wearing special birthday glasses and a sash which I bought last year and now come out for all our birthdays. For his main present he got a box of tools which he himself had chosen on Amazon. I am so lucky my philosopher husband is such a good handy man.<br></br>

We all ate too much of course and a siesta was in order but not for too long for me. I had to finish preparing the dinner - oh gosh our stomachs would suffer that day and our figures. I had a doctor's appointment too so was pretty busy.<br></br>
<br></br>
At 8 or so off we went, the three of us, to Miguel and Oli's flat with all the food and another cake - yes another cake - so that Oli could be part of her father's birthday. We were dying to see Elliot. I cannot get enough of him and neither can any of us. On arrival and as expected, little Elliot as we call him, was at Oli's breast. Suzy immediately sat down next to her and I got both girls and the little cherub's head on camera.<br></br>

As I looked at them, I just hoped, that like my father, Eladio would reach 100 and would spend as much time of his life with his grandson as is physically possible. I love the contented smile on my dear husband's face.<br></br>
<br></br>
I, meanwhile, had to get on with preparing the dinner. I had made one of my signature dishes; potato salad with prawns and had also taken along ingredients for a big tuna salad. This is the potato salad. It was delicious and the recipe comes from my own grandfather who in turn got it from a Swiss recipe book no doubt about 100 years ago.<br></br>

Elliot let us eat on and off. He didn't stay still for long in his cot, far preferring skin contact so we took it turns to hold him so that Oli and Miguel could eat their meal in peace. It was Suzy who held him for longest after dinner and they practically fell asleep together. They looked like sleeping beauties in this photo Miguel took of the two of them. I love it.<br></br>

I can only hope that Suzy has a baby herself one day soon as she looks cut out for motherhood since she has met and fallen in love with Elliot.<br></br>

We left reluctantly at about 11.30. Oli and Miguel were no doubt in for another sleepless night. I didn't sleep too well myself either as I forgot to take my trusted sleeping tablets.<br></br>

Tuesday came and it was another sunny day. Tuesday brought with it important news. In Spain the Supreme Court ruled that Franco's body should be exhumed from the fascist site of The Valley of the Fallen. This comes 40 years after his death.  There had been a tug of war between the government and Franco's family since the socialist leader, Pedro Sánchez announced the measure when he came into power. Spain, as ever, is divided on this question but for me I think justice has been done.<br></br>
<br></br>
My faith in British justice was restored that day too when the Supreme Court ruled that Boris Johnson's suspending of parliament was illegal. Good for Brenda Hale (Baroness Hale of Richmond), the president of the supreme, who by the way is from Yorkshire, for coming to that decision along with all the members of the court. Johnson had some very good lawyers but she wasn't buying his reasons for snatching the power from the people. For me, it's not just good news that parliament will go back to Westminster, the real news is that justice has been made and democracy restored in the UK, a democracy that frightful figure and laughing stock of Europe, the old Etonian called "Bojo", had played with. You can't play with democracy in the country that invented it although he thought he could. I have been reading more about Lady Hale who became famous overnight. She is well known, apparently for her animal brooches, and that day when she read the sentence she was wearing a large spider brooch which was an immediate hit on twitter. Some people referred to her as the black widow. I think she is very brave and love her grit which no doubt "hails" from her Yorkshire roots. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
After the ruling, people were calling for Boris Johnson's head, as he cut short his visit to the UN and returned to the UK. Meanwhile, John Bercow, the speaker I am so fond of, called for MPs to return to Parliament the next day. I personally think Johnson should resign. British politics is in chaos.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The other big news from the UK was about the second biggest tour operator in the world and the inventor of the package tour, Thomas Cook,  which went into administration. British tourists were stranded all over the world and more than a million who had bought flights or holiday packages will have seen them cancelled. This is such a big thing for tourism in both the UK and the countries Thomas Cook tourists travel to. For me Thomas Cook is a household name, the name of the travel agency my father taught me was reputable and where he would go to buy our train tickets in Bradford and of course our travelers' checks.  A visit with my father to Thomas Cook on Broadway was always exciting because it meant we were going somewhere. My father always bought me lots of travelers' checks to cash in foreign banks for local currency as that was how people did it in those days. For me too Thomas Cook is a brand that conjures up nostalgia of my childhood.  No doubt my father will feel the same as I think it was this company where, as a young man, he too bought his tickets to travel to Scandinavia and other places in Europe. So I find it very sad that the company thanks to which we went on holiday across Europe summer after summer when I was a teenager, has just disappeared from the map. I fell sorry for both the staff who will have lost their jobs and for anyone stranded or with a flight cancelled. Tuesday was very bad news for the tourism industry.</div>

Tuesday was certainly a day of big news. On the home front, Oli and Miguel had taken little Elliot for his first doctor's appointment after his birth just one week before. They go to the clinic near us so paid us a surprise visit afterwards. I was delighted to see them again. They came just as we were about to leave for Madrid for lunch with my cousin Sophie and her partner Olivier, so I left feeling a bit divided really wanting to stay. But we had to go.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Sophie is one of my cousin Masha's four daughters who all live in France. Masha is the daughter of my mother's first cousin on my maternal grandmother's side, confusingly also called Masha hahaha. I see Sophie every year at the cousinade and I also know her from before when as a teenager she came here in an exchange visit with one of my Spanish nieces. Sophie, aged 28, works in communication in the French administration in Paris and Olivier must be an electrical engineer as he works in the electricity industry. They had been on holiday in Spain where they visited the mountainous area in between Leon and Asturias known as the peaks of Europe (Picos de Europa). From Asturias they traveled to Madrid and from Madrid would go to Valencia before heading back to France today. I had booked a table at the rather chic and in restaurant called Ten con Ten in the posh street of Ayala in the more upmarket part of El Barrio de Salamanca near where we used to live when we got married, although our house was in the poorer part. There was valet parking thank goodness as otherwise we would have had to go by public transport. We had a very civilised lunch in a very civilised place and it was nice to go out into town and also to be accompanied by my husband who is usually reluctant to leave our gorgeous home hahaha. The food at Ten con Ten is delicious and beautifully served too. We had artichokes to start with - my favourite veg - and both Sophie and I had the oxtail burger. Being on a "diet" I should have skipped "pudding " but when I saw they had pistachio ice cream on their dessert menu I just couldn't resist it. And here we are sitting at our table after lunch together on Tuesday.</div>

It was great to see my cousin and her partner. We parted with a big hug at around 4 something and headed home. I was very happy to see that Oli and Miguel and of course little Elliot were still there and rushed up to my daughter's room to see them. It was time for Elliot's umpteenth feed that day and I was happy to sit on the bed and watch. Pippa wanted to watch too. As I said, I had been wary of how our miniature dachshund who generally hates children, would react to Elliot but I was in for a pleasant surprise. She was mostly curious and just wanted to be part of what the group was doing. So I lifted her up on the bed with me and held her while Elliot fed. Suzy was with us and took one look and said "Mummy and her baby and Oli and her baby" and took a snapshot. We did laugh as I hope you will too when you see the photo below.</div>

It was  a very funny moment. The doctor had pronounced Elliot very healthy but had said he needed a bit of sun and fresh air as he hadn't been out much since his birth. Thus at around 7 and before sunset, the new family left in their car with all the baby paraphernalia and headed for the park in Boadilla near the palace. Miguel later sent this lovely photo of Oli and baby in the pram against the sunset with the palace in the background. It's quite a stunning picture.</div>

When they left, Eladio and I were alone with the dogs as Suzy had gone out too, to one of her private English lessons. I took the time to watch the 16 year old Greta Thunberg's tearful and angry speech at the UN this week which if you haven't seen I urge you to do so. With tears in her eyes and clear but halting English this new icon for climate change told her audience that what she was doing was not right. She said she should be back at school and that they should be doing their job. Her words were very strong. Here is just one quote from her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAJsdgTPJpU">amazing speech</a>: "People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of mass extinction and all you talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth". At many points in her speech she said "how dare you?" She also said: "You have stolen my childhood and my dreams with your empty words" and hopefully shamed her audience and the world. This girl is a new wonder as it it thanks to her that the world is waking up to the dangers of climate change and that time is running out. One person who she has not shamed is Donald Trump who stupidly doesn't believe in climate change despite the scientific evidence. He was at her speech too, ignored her and later posted a mocking tweet about this young girl, who if he listened, could teach him a real lesson. This was it:  "She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see! Later Greta changed her twitter profile bio to reflect these mocking words. That was the best response she could have given him. It's amazing how many detractors she has who troll her on internet. It's quite amazing too how a 16 year old with plaits trying to save the planet can inspire such rage. The truth behind this is that she scares them and all that she stands for, youth, determination and change. I can only thank her for what she is doing.</div>

Both Eladio and I are very impressed with her and think she deserves a Nobel prize for her work.  However, there is a side to her that unsettles me a bit. Some people say that the people driving her are her parents but it seems, if what I read is true, that it is the other way around. She has forced her parents to go vegan and her mother to give up her job. That sounds a bit like bullying to me. Her mother was an opera singer and used to fly a lot. Greta is against flying because of the carbon emissions. But how else I ask can we get around the world. Are we supposed to stop traveling?  My daughter is vegan and vegetarian, depending on the moment and she hasn't bullied me into anything although she does often make comments about our eating meat, etc. As parents we should not accept mandates from our children in general.  We discussed the new climate star and the day's news over a quick and quiet dinner on the terrace that night. Suzy joined us after her lessons and then I spent at least an hour catching up with her before going to bed. She only has one month to go before leaving again for Bali which she now considers her home and I am going to miss her.</div>

Wednesday came and brought with it more wonderful sunshine. We are in for a lovely sunny and warm spell after all the rain. Norah our beagle was a bit off and wasn't eating but amazingly wanted to come on our walk. We observed her all day - she wouldn't eat - and decided that if she wasn't better by the end of the day we would take her to the vet. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Wednesday was a very quiet day and one of the only days we hadn't seen Elliot since his birth. I get updates each morning from Oli on how the nights have been. Her conclusion, once again is that little Elliot is a little saint during the day and a little devil at night. Thus Oli and Miguel get very little sleep. Well, we've all been there haven't we? I always ask for a morning photo and this was Wednesday's.</div>

Parliament was back in session in the UK after the supreme court's historic ruling and Boris Johnson was on his way home from New York. There was total chaos at Westminster and no one knows really what the outcome will be. There were calls for the PM to resign which he has refused to do. He called for General Elections which Labour refuse to back and others. This is because they want an extension with the EU to happen before elections are called so as to avoid leaving the EU without a deal. It really is one big shambles and each day there are new twists and turns.  That day had me thinking again that when Britain leaves the EU, with our without a deal, I shall most probably have to apply for Spanish nationality, something I will be forced to do rather than  voluntarily. That makes me angry. I wonder too what will happen to my father's health care which is now in the reliable hands of the Spanish health system. Will he lose that right here? If he does we will have to fork out for a private health policy which for a 100 year old will be prohibitive. I can only hope and pray that the British government comes to its senses and agrees to reciprocal rights for Spaniards in the UK which is what the Spanish government has asked for in return for offering full residency rights to Brits in Spain of whom there are many many more than Spaniards in the UK. What a mess. </div>

There is not much more to tell about Wednesday. Suzy was the lucky one to see Elliot that day when she went to visit Oli and her new family after her lessons. Suzy is the happiest aunt in the world. I have never had a sister and wish I did have one as sisterly love is something I have always thought was something very special. Here she is with her little nephew again. I love photos of Suzy with Elliot and the love between them which is oh so pure.</div>

Thursday came. We had a guest called Sergio who was leaving that day. He had come for three nights and not once did we see him. He had been before and I don't think I saw him last time either. Two more guests were coming that day, Lorna, Andy's daughter from France and another girl, also from France (Perpignan) called Elisabeth.<br></br>
<br></br>
Thursday was going to be a day like any other day except that it ended up being the highlight of the week as Oli, Miguel and Elliot came unexpectedly for lunch and stayed until after dinner. That meant I could feast my eyes on my darling grandson. The only downside was that in the morning I had to take Norah, our 10 year old beagle, to the vet. She hadn't been well since Tuesday and had something wrong with her "tummy" and she hadn't eaten for two days. So off I went with her alone in the car as Suzy was busy and Eladio had gone to a routine doctor's appointment. Usually she hates the car but on Thursday she sat very quietly, a sure sign she was not well.  I was lucky that I didn't have to wait too long at the vet before someone saw her. Here she is on the vet's table looking a sorry sight.<br></br>

After an initial exploration, an X-ray and a scan it was obvious she had some foreign object in her stomach. We had no idea what it was. But it was causing her pain and inflammation. The vet recommended that she stay in hospital and be given treatment for whatever it was to be expelled naturally. If it didn't come out, the next day she would have to be operated on. So I left the poor dog at the hospital and wouldn't know anything until the next day. Oh dear, Norah is always on the lookout for any sort of food and this was bound to happen one day. I wondered if it was a conker as the size was right, about 2cm wide.<br></br>
<br></br>
I came home to prepare the fruit and flowers for our new guests' rooms and then took a late walk with Pippa. It was so hot I didn't make it to the end. As I was coming back, Oli wrote to say they were coming for lunch. Lunch would have been a minor affair that day as I had run out of provisions. Thus I had to do a sort of fish and loaves miracle and came up with a dish of baked salmon, mushroom sauce, rice, roast red peppers and blue cabbage with garlic. The plates looked very colourful. We had lunch late and even Suzy who finished her lessons that day at 3.10 was able to join us. We ate outside in the sun and I know my father was delighted to see little Elliot.<br></br>
<br></br>
That morning, even more cards and parcels arrived for Oli, Miguel and Elliot from girlfriends of mine. The postman was busy that day at our house delivering all sorts of enticing looking post. That day there was a parcel from Anne, my Finnish friend who had knitted a beautiful blanket. There was also a parcel from Joanne with lots of lovely baby wear as well as lovely cards, the type you can only get in the UK. There was even one for us, as grandparents, congratulating us on the birth of our grandson. I was very touched. So was Oli who remarked that my friends must really love me. They do and I am very grateful. So thanks once again to Zuka, the girls from QE (Cris, Bea and Gloria), Sandra, Jacky, Joanne and Anne.<br></br>
<br></br>
Oli and Miguel opened their new parcels after lunch and immediately put the new clothes to use. Here is little Elliot covered in Anne's home made colourful blanket.  He is also wearing one of Joanne's little baby caps to keep his head warm. Oli told me she had learned from the baby classes that babies always need one more layer of clothes than adults.<br></br>

As you can see in the photo he is about to cry. He doesn't like being in his cot, far preferring the comfort of arms and especially his mother's where he can suckle to his heart's content. And that's what he did for most of the afternoon. Later I helped Oli bathe him. He doesn't like water yet either and later when he was warm and dry and clean I held him in my arms for quite a long time enjoying the bonding moments and speaking to him in English. Here he is in my arms a place I love him to be.<br></br>

Eladio soon joined us and took little Elliot from me to hold in his arms. I love seeing little Elliot being held by his grandfather. Oli took a photo of us together with her baby, the two doting grandparents. I love it.<br></br>

This time I had nothing with which to rustle up dinner so Eladio and I went out to Carrefour to bring back delicious ingredients for dinner. Oli was delighted to see the table laid and groaning with lovely food: left over tortilla, ibérico ham and lomo, cheese, a salad, gazpacho and her favourite; croquettes. It was so warm at 9 pm (24ºc) we ate outside again. At around 10 pm, the newly formed family left with our grandson for what I hoped would be a reasonable night for the parents.<br></br>
<br></br>
Left alone with Suzy out and the guests out too, apart from a new arrival, we went up to our quarters. We watched a documentary on stories of escape from Alcatraz and an interesting one on Japan after WW2. I had to stay awake until Elisabeth arrived at 12.15. After showing her to her room, I was able to go back to sleep.<br></br>
<br></br>
I woke up at 6.40 on Friday morning and it was to be a quiet and sunny day. I was worried about Norah and rang the vet. I was happy to hear our naughty beagle had expelled what looked like a peach stone that very morning. Of course they had to check by doing another scan whether it was the stone that was causing the problem.<br></br>
<br></br>
We went and did the food shopping at my least favourite supermarket, Mercadona, before heading for the vet to pick up Norah. Thankfully the clinic was not too full and we didn't have to wait very long. The scan had been completed and our beagle was given the all clear. Soon she was with us. As soon as she saw us she began to cry in her beagle voice way. Poor thing she must have missed us while being in a cage which is a horrible way for animals to be left in hospital. But thank goodness the stone had come out on its own and that she didn't need surgery. It turned out to be a nectarine stone which the vet showed us. This is what was in her stomach.<br></br>

We were told that it is very unusual for something so big to come out naturally and that Norah had been very lucky. Yes, she had, but she's a very silly dog who will eat anything she finds and the whole episode cost us just under 400 euros. I wondered how on earth the stone had got into her body and could only think she may have picked up an eaten nectarine from the dustbin under the sink. It is usually kept shut tight, just because of Norah, but maybe someone had left it a little open.<br></br>
<br></br>
So all is well that ends well and we brought Norah home. She was delighted to be back and her appetite had returned too. I gave her a bowl of rice with some meat loaf in it which she wolfed down while the other dogs looked on jealously hahaha.<br></br>
<br></br>
That was the good news of the day. There is little else to tell on the home front. On the international and domestic front was news of a big climate strike being led by young people all over the world. As I said, people are waking up to the dangers and are goading politicians and governments to do something about it soon. The other story this week apart from depressing British politics is the process to impeach Donald Trump after news of a phone call with the Ukrainian President was leaked through a CIA whistle blower. In the call Trump is asking his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate his rival Jo Biden and his son for their involvement in some corruption case in that country. Will he be impeached? I hope so but somehow I don't think it will come to that and God forbid he will be re-elected for a second term.<br></br>
<br></br>
On the bright side, there is always Elliot to cheer me up and keep me going. I can't get enough of him and although I didn't see him on Friday, Oli sent me photos. Here is one of him at her breast or nodding by it which is where he seems to prefer to lie down. Oh how I love this little boy.<br></br>

In the afternoon we had the place almost to ourselves. Our guests were out and Eladio and I, accompanied by the dogs, sat by the pool reading. The temperature reached 30ºc that day. We now have our dinners outside which we love.<br></br>
<br></br>
Saturday came and our French student, Elisabeth, left. Oliver from the US would be coming to occupy her room that day but wouldn't arrive until past 10 pm when I would be asleep. I do hate having to leave my bed late at night to meet guests. My latest check in time is at 9 pm but often guests ignore this unfortunately.<br></br>
<br></br>
Saturday was a lovely busy day with a visit to Elliot to make it extra special. The morning was spent on errands after our walk. We had to buy yet another new hoover  as the old one had broken down. Eladio tried to mend it but the engine was burnt. Thus we went out missing a morning at home in the sunshine. I would have loved to join Suzy in the garden. We were home for lunch though and what did I make? Ah yes, broccoli and mushroom soup followed by bean stew (fabada). I didn't have the latter owing to my careful eating these days and ate fillet steak instead.<br></br>
<br></br>
At about 4.30, Suzy and I set off for Oli and Miguel's flat eager to visit. Eladio stayed behind wanting a quiet time and arguing he would see them today for lunch. When we got there, the girls' friend Elenita was visiting and Miguel's parents had just left. They had lots of visitors that day and little Elliot behaved perfectly. He was in Elena's arms when we arrived and she soon passed on my grandson to me. He slept throughout our visit and peacefully so against my chest which seems to be his favourite position. Here we are together enjoying grandmother and grandson time. I have to say I am the happiest grandmother in the world. Who would have believed that of me, someone who generally is not interested in babies, far preferring puppies? Ah, but he is my own flesh and blood and that is so strong there is no ignoring it.<br></br>

It was such wonderful weather outside, we went for a walk with Elliot for him to get a bit of vitamin D. It was my first walk with my grandson and he behaved beautifully. He might not like his cot at home but he is quite content usually in his pram or car seat. He must like the movement.<br></br>
<br></br>
Soon we had to leave if we were to be home again on time for dinner with Eladio who likes his meal at 8.15 or approximately that time. So we left reluctantly but happy that we would see the new family the next day for lunch at home.<br></br>
<br></br>
Again we had dinner outside because of the wonderful weather - the so-called "veranillo de San Miguel" (San Miguel summer) which comes at the end of September in Spain. It's a sort of "Indian summer". Suzy joined us but later went to stay the night with a friend.<br></br>
<br></br>
We settled down in bed to watch more of a not too interesting series based on true facts called "Manhunt - Unabomber" until I was woken up by my latest guest, Oliver a young man from New York. He had arrived late and left early this morning so I only saw him for a few minutes. Today another young man, Noel, who is Spanish, will be coming to occupy his room. September has been very busy with Airbnb and October looks to be busy too.<br></br>
<br></br>
I found it difficult to sleep afterwards and continued watching the series until I fell asleep at about 1 am. I was up today slightly later at 7.30 and was first in the kitchen to feed the dogs.<br></br>
<br></br>
Today will be another lovely sunny day and you will hear all about it in next week's post.<br></br>
<br></br>
Sorry again if I have bored you with my tales of little Elliot but I think you can forgive me can't you?<br></br>
<br></br>
Now my friends, it's time to sign off now and get on with the day.<br></br>
<br></br>
Cheers till next Sunday,<br></br>
