That was the moment I fell in love with Capadoccia</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Dear everyone.</p><p>Thanks for reading my blog and for following our epic road trip from Madrid to Armenia and back. We are returning via a different route, through Greece, Albania, Montenegro and other Balkan countries. </p><p>Today finds us in Thessalonika on day 38  and in the 10th country of our journey with about 2 weeks to go till we are home. We left Madrid on 21st April and have seen and done so much but we are nearing the end and I hate endings. However, we have something wonderful to look forward to and that is the wedding of our youngest daughter, Olivia to Miguel, on 16th June and we must be back well on time for that. </p><p>Today we are in Thessalonika but last Sunday we were still crossing the huge length of Turkey from East to West,  which in total came to 2600km!  That day saw us travelling from Erzurum in the east of the country to Sivas, a big spa town, nearer the centre. It was a long drive, more than  400km and over 5.5h but we took it in turns. Turkey has some great roads, many of them dual carriageways but it is so mountainous that you find yourself driving round hairpin bends or across mountain passes over 2000 metres high. The temperature goes from 5 degrees to 15, then to 10 and back to 5 and then to 20 all in a question of a few hours or at least it did last Sunday. You overtake lorries with number plates from Iran, Iraq and even Syria and you just marvel at where you are in the world. The terrain changes from lush green to dessert like surroundings in a question of a few kilometres and you feel as if you are driving on an obstacle race with booby traps everywhere hahaha. It is all part of the adventure. I can hardly believe that I have driven in so many countries and on so many different types of roads. I have never really liked driving long distance so am rather pleased with myself that I have overcome any fears and just got on with it. I could not let Eladio be the only driver. I had to do my bit and I did it and I am doing it, even over potholed roads in Armenia to that terrible border!  On this journey you feel totally out of your comfort zone and have to be prepared for anything and everything. One thing I cannot take though are the typical Turkish loos hahaha and if there was no alternative then I just looked for a private area nearby to squat. I refused to go into those stinking toilets which I can never be prepared for hahaha. </p><p>It is not only the terrain that changes suddenly in Turkey, so does the weather and last Sunday was a prime example. We went from rain to sun, to showers, to cloudy skies, to drizzle, pouring rain and then sunshine again all in just a few hours. We stopped to have coffee in our flasks as it's difficult to get on many of the roads. I had to have a photo of Eladio at this stop where you can see chickens strutting around, a Turkish lorry and our Mini as well as snow covered mountains in the background. We were in luck as it was sunny. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjeAaqhA5NqM03j1XDrXttA92rWMDB1rXexwO9XoWPYZRMTsqAl8AyeJTbZJuYHHjahueGl_xbCdcume8t2Ed9sSJ5WbcgWAlcy2YOKGBP_NCEi0STQH919zXflX8RyfzOEEttE6FVkblrRsDx2fgm9rTDqW8AMY0z8N3theNb_AOV20wwXQO0/s4032/20230521_120342.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjeAaqhA5NqM03j1XDrXttA92rWMDB1rXexwO9XoWPYZRMTsqAl8AyeJTbZJuYHHjahueGl_xbCdcume8t2Ed9sSJ5WbcgWAlcy2YOKGBP_NCEi0STQH919zXflX8RyfzOEEttE6FVkblrRsDx2fgm9rTDqW8AMY0z8N3theNb_AOV20wwXQO0/w400-h180/20230521_120342.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A stop for our own coffee on the road from Erzurum to Sivas</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div>By about 4pm we were in Sivas, a beautiful town which is not at all on the tourist route.

We were given a tiny, tiny room so I asked for a larger room. I got a small suite for just 25 euros more. At least now all our stuff would fit in. Before unpacking we went down to the huge restaurant to have a meal as we were starving. Just see if you can spot Eladio in the photo below waiting for his lentil soup. </div><div><br></br></div><div><span style="color: #202124;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"> </span></span><div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJIpXa_KqD_sukcvzh40JDsq9TdpjXOUbAh0AkA94fc27URtOZ5kZFyR-8Uss4KM2ycNJ3tFc3rmTvsdHNQ3_sBWVJcQVYqyFHoSiJ07S5kajngb3_wQqFYY76TbIgESjAyiugnC2KSrNzQW9yN7b5PKFLWarvV0oV9Yo4EKHP16kRJuMWwDk/s4032/20230521_155843.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJIpXa_KqD_sukcvzh40JDsq9TdpjXOUbAh0AkA94fc27URtOZ5kZFyR-8Uss4KM2ycNJ3tFc3rmTvsdHNQ3_sBWVJcQVYqyFHoSiJ07S5kajngb3_wQqFYY76TbIgESjAyiugnC2KSrNzQW9yN7b5PKFLWarvV0oV9Yo4EKHP16kRJuMWwDk/w400-h180/20230521_155843.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Lunch at the hotel in Sivas last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We chose local food and it was the best Turkish food we had had until then.

I wrote to her early in the morning and she replied immediately as that morning she had to be at the TV studio at 5 a.m. Later in the evening we had a video call to wish her a happy birthday and it was lovely to see Elliot and Juliet. We haven't seen them for such a long time I was a bit worried they might have forgotten us. I had no need to worry as apparently Elliot had expressed the wish to go to "Booboo's house" that day. I can't wait to see them again. Later Oli sent me a photo with her cake. On Friday I had blocked the Airbnb calendar so she could have a little party at our house which she ended up not having as it has been raining in Madrid as it has wherever we have been recently. I am hoping it will stop soon. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXbLspvhwW5ta1VXZcyu0GsA48hZTmPy_RHjAuH1S7szLmdAYJKW236dqdpGBeliiyLH-Hz7dDLh2TV-4dh6Agc1GHlo0jPGZ2G4qKLxZpX_xkaNpjnhmjN69GgASKcrovQZvrVhlRGcK_c4xZtuCP0sxF0CSoXVGElJSZA13-Gpfnt_eh2q4/s1600/Oli%20bday.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="300" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhXbLspvhwW5ta1VXZcyu0GsA48hZTmPy_RHjAuH1S7szLmdAYJKW236dqdpGBeliiyLH-Hz7dDLh2TV-4dh6Agc1GHlo0jPGZ2G4qKLxZpX_xkaNpjnhmjN69GgASKcrovQZvrVhlRGcK_c4xZtuCP0sxF0CSoXVGElJSZA13-Gpfnt_eh2q4/w400-h300/Oli%20bday.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Picture on Oli's birthday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>I was keen to know her wedding plans and felt a bit guilty not being there but we had no idea they were getting married  until we had already started our journey.

Now we count the pieces, hahahaha. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvsAQJ6xlo7ODk7NxqJt5H2LZVBUFZBwaVFMPvk0ibp1WoxFnJASAXP21k5WUv9sDHsC0oLetdzDd2KIPcEZ60pnqQBKKFV-mF95X41rYeeoZ3gzXgpdzs_LHRxAP7vNf1iYgqMkX8wYjkj-pqlCbeVFl4GK9H8c3oi3Fk2LGUGjdgxJ1fk8w/s4032/20230522_085038.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvsAQJ6xlo7ODk7NxqJt5H2LZVBUFZBwaVFMPvk0ibp1WoxFnJASAXP21k5WUv9sDHsC0oLetdzDd2KIPcEZ60pnqQBKKFV-mF95X41rYeeoZ3gzXgpdzs_LHRxAP7vNf1iYgqMkX8wYjkj-pqlCbeVFl4GK9H8c3oi3Fk2LGUGjdgxJ1fk8w/w400-h180/20230522_085038.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Leaving Sivas in Turkey on Monday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Before setting off we went in search of a chemist. I learned that in Turkey chemists are called "Eczane" and the sign is not a green cross like elsewhere but a large red "E". Funny eh? Eladio's shingles /zoster herpes, although better, had not gone and he was still in pain despite having finished the course of tablets prescribed to him by the dermatologist in Dilijan, Armenia. So we went to get more. I was a bit worried he was still in pain and not completely himself. A week later he is a lot better. </div><div><br></br></div><div>The drive to Ürgüp near Kayseri in central Turkey was only about 3.5h on excellent roads. We took it in turns to drive but neither of us felt comfortable driving in Turkey as our Green Card had expired. We stopped to ring our car insurance company which took ages  to be told we were only entitled to 30 days insurance a year and that they couldn't give us another one. So what to do? We would just have to chance it as we only had a few days left in Turkey before returning to the EU, first in Greece. Later for other countries like Albania or Montenegro, I read you can buy insurance at the border. </div><div><br></br></div><div>So we continued our journey.  I didn't know much about Capadoccia apart from the fact that it is an area of geological wonder and that many tourists come here. Eladio knew a lot more and gave me a short history lesson - I told you he was my history teacher on this epic road trip. He told me about the Capadoccian Fathers - Basil the Great of Caesarea, his brother Gregory of Nyssas and their friend Gregory of Nazianzus who lived in the 4th century. They were Greeks as Capadoccia then belonged to them. So what did they do? They defended the Christian faith and made essential contributions to the definition of the Trinity. The Trinity, according to them is that "<i>the Son is of the Father alone, neither made nor created but begotten; the Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son, neither made nor created nor begotten, but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers, one Son, not three Sons, one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits"</i>. This was the doctrine finalised at the First Council of Constantinople in 381 which included the final version of the Nicene creed which all Christian faiths adhere to. "<i>The creed confirmed the resurrection of the dead when the soul meets the glorified body and the existence of souls in Heaven</i>". </div><div><br></br></div><div>This doctrine of the Trinity defined at the Council of Constantinople, as explained to me by the Armenian priest at the Hagharstin Monastery in Dilijan, is the basis of the faith of the Armenian church and which other churches do not all agree upon.  Gosh, once again I was going to come face to face with religion. </div><div><br></br></div><div>The three Capadoccian fathers  are considered saints in both Western and Eastern churches. Eladio told me too that in reality the cradle of philosophy is in current day Turkey and not in Greece, having its origins in Miletus. </div><div><br></br></div><div>I am sure most tourists visiting Capadoccia probably don't know about the historical importance of the region and, like me, only know of it because of its unique geological wonders, mostly, I think because of the "fairy chimneys" to be found in the region. I was excited to be there and so was Eladio. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Finding our Airbnb host was a little bit of a challenge as the Cave House we had booked was a little outside the town and along some very steep and narrow, cobbled streets. But we found the owner and he greeted us and invited us into his house. We checked in and then he sat down and showed us maps of places to visit. He didn't think we needed a guide but I did. We would see. Finally he led us to our little cave house where he later took Eladio in our car as we would never have found the place. Here is the Mini in front of our wonderful house. </div><div><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNJLa_H7tFxIP5HG5l82f4t9TmxFgyPiarYIxdEwfLW_0GD9ntVV9Y6DLoASH3idWdavXw1J4Iy78N89-JPHqgpQDu-1IXdTML2odKvVjk790sVCfuCjZPWIFvFy_NjUTmo2kJ5uGAn7NcfQrUQSH61lGOQkYzKupdQCtE9NzeORCocJoS6OA/s4032/20230522_155719.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjNJLa_H7tFxIP5HG5l82f4t9TmxFgyPiarYIxdEwfLW_0GD9ntVV9Y6DLoASH3idWdavXw1J4Iy78N89-JPHqgpQDu-1IXdTML2odKvVjk790sVCfuCjZPWIFvFy_NjUTmo2kJ5uGAn7NcfQrUQSH61lGOQkYzKupdQCtE9NzeORCocJoS6OA/w400-h180/20230522_155719.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Mini outside our cave house</i></td></tr></tbody></table>We loved the place immediately. I soon realised that what the owner Hikmet has is a wonderful tourist cash cow. He has a whole complex of cave houses - about 8 of them in different sizes, all set in the same complex. The courtyards and gardens are all common to the houses and the place is enormous. But let me show you our cave house which I thought was very big for just two. It had a huge bedroom and lounge with high ceilings, a medium sized kitchen and an enormous bathroom with a double shower. The place is beautifully equipped and very comfortable. Here are some photos. <br></br><div><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZgVKEe6JPcgVc8oaAO5VXhBv9kgNLU4sl2suvCWeDxU1sG1Bn6hkxzZuWkqaZf8doPPY8IUu0eORi6FnMkziwf5fW_YbZ4mxlMYWM42sfh5kwK5cK7w3TPx0EvQeNN8VFoapLwvv_y0O0FS5ZVcliU7UM1pXgPtBHXD_sCvb6v57zii43pfo/s960/97ce239a-acf5-41a6-ada0-5883329d8fb1.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="265" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhZgVKEe6JPcgVc8oaAO5VXhBv9kgNLU4sl2suvCWeDxU1sG1Bn6hkxzZuWkqaZf8doPPY8IUu0eORi6FnMkziwf5fW_YbZ4mxlMYWM42sfh5kwK5cK7w3TPx0EvQeNN8VFoapLwvv_y0O0FS5ZVcliU7UM1pXgPtBHXD_sCvb6v57zii43pfo/w400-h265/97ce239a-acf5-41a6-ada0-5883329d8fb1.webp" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjmjEY1Fk26DDDmDWlZungmGeIee_AVN1XfPW7gE3aekjWKmwBsDcOnjWFgWso9egd9CshbpysJvJp0VC47odU5O2YL6VDu6-m0IL3Gx5cFKn4JRzD6XXHYyoH5g8mnlhUWsQvxMX6dMkoKrfgcGU2hu21hIAqxmEPo4rxTf71bP4wyBZO5xLQ/s1442/b42ce02d-1cc9-436b-b3fd-4bdceb6e1fc5.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjmjEY1Fk26DDDmDWlZungmGeIee_AVN1XfPW7gE3aekjWKmwBsDcOnjWFgWso9egd9CshbpysJvJp0VC47odU5O2YL6VDu6-m0IL3Gx5cFKn4JRzD6XXHYyoH5g8mnlhUWsQvxMX6dMkoKrfgcGU2hu21hIAqxmEPo4rxTf71bP4wyBZO5xLQ/w333-h400/b42ce02d-1cc9-436b-b3fd-4bdceb6e1fc5.webp" width="333"></img></a></div><br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvP7--2-_iqMsD0Ouu7QH29ZBpTkU22vaaybemoKofpH_z8MQ-QF8EPM6aRk4yr5vb7L8M3m-5PqLXH8fYgrC6VTlf-iT6oOjsNFJu4T92x_ylR-eoMQIBwWOyZe40TiDteUVYEyphUtwlH2EdabAplngyw4Ejq9_inuuyOK_ZKftjeBGA0TM/s1200/2bdac936-92ea-4118-bd23-34a52fc4b60e.webp" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="236" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvP7--2-_iqMsD0Ouu7QH29ZBpTkU22vaaybemoKofpH_z8MQ-QF8EPM6aRk4yr5vb7L8M3m-5PqLXH8fYgrC6VTlf-iT6oOjsNFJu4T92x_ylR-eoMQIBwWOyZe40TiDteUVYEyphUtwlH2EdabAplngyw4Ejq9_inuuyOK_ZKftjeBGA0TM/w400-h236/2bdac936-92ea-4118-bd23-34a52fc4b60e.webp" width="400"></img></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5Nf2V61equxBAnkDeNRT6nvPXsW86nMvyfOkbvmzct9Z17WN0gh7cxw5wZ_up0DiAQO_6sFQlRv9dEjB0si5FrSvEeuKa3BdrtEnPtEcVkC9SnwRU-357LQFNIJMdBW0QlqN7jajbWyqXu1vsySAJ0VVc3iD_n1nK5TOLEoMnqKqzPJtyFbU/s4032/20230522_134326.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><i><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg5Nf2V61equxBAnkDeNRT6nvPXsW86nMvyfOkbvmzct9Z17WN0gh7cxw5wZ_up0DiAQO_6sFQlRv9dEjB0si5FrSvEeuKa3BdrtEnPtEcVkC9SnwRU-357LQFNIJMdBW0QlqN7jajbWyqXu1vsySAJ0VVc3iD_n1nK5TOLEoMnqKqzPJtyFbU/w180-h400/20230522_134326.jpg" width="180"></img></i></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Our cave house in Ürgüp Capadoccia</i></td></tr></tbody></table>But first things first. We needed to eat and would later enjoy the house. That's when it started to rain and rain water poured down the narrow cobbled streets with cars going past and splashing us. Our host had recommended a restaurant in the main town and it was about 1km via incredibly steep streets. We found it and were served quickly. I had hoped for a delicious Turkish meal but didn't get one. It was ok but nothing special. What was special was having tea with baklava afterwards in a cafe across the way. While we ate and drank we tried to decide how to spend our time there - just one afternoon and one full day. We decided we needed a guide so walked into a tourist guide establishment called "Pupa" and were received by an employee who kept saying "I understand" which I doubted he did. In the end, as nearly everywhere in Turkey, we communicated via Google Translate. We had already booked a balloon trip on Airbnb for the next morning so agreed with Ayhan that we would buy a day's tour of the Red Valley - the main area to visit in Capadoccia. I learned the whole area of Capadoccia is as big as 300km so we would only really touch the surface. They would pick us up the next day at around 9.30. So we decided just to chill out, take some pics of the cave homes in the rocks around Ürgüp, andt go back and enjoy our wonderful house. <div><br></br></div><div><div>Here is one of the rocky parts with caves which are no longer in use.

As I said, we wanted to enjoy it and the sights could wait. I was particularly looking forward to flying in a balloon in Goreme  so was rather upset to get a message from the organisers that all flights had been cancelled the next day due to "adverse weather". Our Guardian Angel had abandoned us again. Eladio wasn't too fussed but I would have loved the experience. On the plus side we wouldn't have to be ready to be picked up at 6 am.</div><div><br></br></div><div>We spent the rest of the day enjoying every moment of this unique house, did some washing - the property has two washing machines and two dryers - and had a simple meal of scrambled eggs on toast. We both went to bed early as we have done throughout our trip. </div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Tuesday </b>came - the day of our tour and the forecast was for rain all day but in the end it only rained at around lunch time and we enjoyed a sunny morning. On our tour we were accompanied by people from Israel, Singapore, England and Mexico. We immediately made friends with the Mexican family; father and mother and their delightful daughter Paula who doubled as our photographer that day. Thus we got lots of photos together in Capadoccia. I loved our very knowledgeable guide, Ali, who looked after us wonderfully. We went through Goreme, the tourist epicentre of the area and he told us that now not one local lives there - it's just so full of tourists. He said it was the French who first made Capadoccia famous to tourists in the 70's. When they saw the pinnacle like rocks and caves and saw people living in them they couldn't believe their eyes and coined the term "fairy chimney". The real word is "hoodoo", a tall thin spire like rock formed over centuries by erosion and volcanoes. Our first proper sight was at the Goreme viewpoint where Paula took the photo of us that I have chosen as this week's feature photo. That was the moment I fell in love with Capadoccia. What a place; on a par with Petra in my experience for its uniqueness. <br></br><div><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCwwCwy_H0xMMwiJVd0cZ0csveePFMzWnaisNLGEGbnwZpVYAIbIESc9GSYtmO958cfwenSxHtqI1msNQiNaw_umFmyigigoBrbCfyAevs9GZilfRpFTXXCErnq6BfCTFiIkfC9u2CVTlK97OyF1I8nlJuec7qRg438FLsQ7-pEPf45TGDAzs/s4032/20230523_103343.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCwwCwy_H0xMMwiJVd0cZ0csveePFMzWnaisNLGEGbnwZpVYAIbIESc9GSYtmO958cfwenSxHtqI1msNQiNaw_umFmyigigoBrbCfyAevs9GZilfRpFTXXCErnq6BfCTFiIkfC9u2CVTlK97OyF1I8nlJuec7qRg438FLsQ7-pEPf45TGDAzs/w400-h180/20230523_103343.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Photo taken from the Goreme viewpoint</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhJEJxBX7ys cc">video</a> that shows  a bit more. <br></br><div><br></br></div><div>Paula took all our photos that day and we took some of her and her parents too and we became quite chummy.

This was the highlight of the day. The area we saw was where persecuted Christians sought refuge in the 4th century and it became a monastic complex. It is full of churches hidden in caves. From the outside, hidden in their caves, those first Christians hoped not to be seen by their persecutors, mostly Roman soldiers. It is a wondrous place to visit and impossible to imagine how people lived in the caves and how they survived. Later it became part of the Silk Road and its inhabitants became craftsmen mainly making objects with precious metals, pottery and of course carpets. It is important to understand that those first Christians would become eventually Greek Orthodox when Capadoccia and most of Turkey was under Greek rule.

This first happened during the terrible iconoclastic era when Roman Emperor Leo III forbade the worship of images in the 8th century. Then we heard that in the beginning of the 20th century, the Greek Orthodox population was responsible for more destruction. How could that be? It was because of a little heard of population exchange between Turkey and Greece when Muslims in Greece and Greek Orthodox in Turkey were made to leave their country of dwelling and go to their country of origin. So 900.000 Greek Orthodox inhabitants of Anatolia (Turkey) where exchanged for a Muslim population of around 400.000 who lived in Greece. This forced population exchange made it legally possible for both countries' governments to cleanse their countries of ethnic minorities! So many Greeks took parts of the images - mainly the faces and the eyes, as they considered them so holy they couldn't be left behind. What a story!<br></br><div><br></br></div><div>We learned so much that day, and I soon realised there is as much history as geology to be learned from this fascinating part of the world. </div><div><br></br></div><div>When the Greeks left, they took all their craftsmanship skills with them and the Capadoccia region lost its commercial value. The government stepped in and subsidised training of the two main trades: carpet weaving and pottery making. </div><div><br></br></div>Turkey is world famous for its carpets and we were taken to a factory where they are handmade and were to see a carpet in the making. Here is one of the women making a carpet for tourists to see. </div><div><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhp2LjZ2tW6cnmVxR71EcHSPfzkqX-LJPYf51bvd5X8bZYw3FK7ChPjYKS4UL0FBBBotFM4uK2Z7h3SbME8WiXwlGQnzyNpUop91Y-lBFuSEoRgG3lpT-JBxfUTx_Oy2dPPty3Zczr8byvjlIzq8LIu4EO69RWEiTAbxRVlLrG1u7SqaDNbZaI/s4032/20230523_135836.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhp2LjZ2tW6cnmVxR71EcHSPfzkqX-LJPYf51bvd5X8bZYw3FK7ChPjYKS4UL0FBBBotFM4uK2Z7h3SbME8WiXwlGQnzyNpUop91Y-lBFuSEoRgG3lpT-JBxfUTx_Oy2dPPty3Zczr8byvjlIzq8LIu4EO69RWEiTAbxRVlLrG1u7SqaDNbZaI/w400-h180/20230523_135836.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Carpet weaving in Capadoccia</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div>Here is a short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbqW35nsZG8">video</a> for you to see too. We learned that the difference between Turkish and Persian carpets - Turkey's greatest rival -  is in the knots. Iranian carpets are weaved using just one knot whereas Turkish carpets are weaved using two or rather a double threaded knot. </div><br></br></div><div>The only way to make an income in the area after the Greeks left was by learning to make carpets and pottery. For some reason it is the women who make carpets and the men who are potters. As we watched the amazing process we heard that when marriages were arranged the prospective bride had to make a carpet for her future mother-in-law to inspect. If it was well done - and they can take up to months to make - then she was fit for marriage as it proved she had patience. Later we learned that prospective grooms had to be able to make pottery to find a wife! I asked our guide if arranged marriages still exist in Turkey today and I was told that although they are on the decline they still happen. I should add we didn't buy anything. The carpets were extraordinary but our house is full of oriental rugs and these came in thousands of dollars!</div><div><br></br></div><div>After a brief break for lunch we were taken to see a pottery place - another lure for tourists but we went along.

The process we saw was the way pottery was made when the "kick wheel" was invented over 4000 years ago by the Hittites, according to our guide. Today, of course it is made by a more advanced method. We were then lured into room after room of amazing ceramics but when I was told one small bowl cost 100 dollars, I just looked the other way. No doubt this is art in the making and of great value but it was above my price line, hahahahaha. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">That was the end of our tour and Eladio and I were tired and wanted to go "home" to our cave and rest. And rest we did. Well, sort of. I had a skype call with my dear friend Amanda and also did more washing. I loved doing the washing at the complex at our cave home - the owner has 2 washing machines and 2 dryers all inside caves! I took advantage and even washed my trainers.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br></br></div>That was our last night in Capadoccia which I fell in love with. If you haven't been, add it to your bucket list and also add this wonderful cave house to stay at if you ever go.</div><div><br></br></div><div>The next day was <b>Wednesday</b> 24th May - time was ticking - and we were travelling to Ankara on our way out of Turkey which seemed to take forever as it is such a huge country. We still had two nights in Turkey before crossing the Ipsala border into Greece. </div><div><br></br></div><div>That morning we had to say goodbye to our wonderful cave home in Capadoccia - the best accommodation of all our trip until now. The route to Greece was necessarily via Ankara where we didn't really want to go but there was no option. I once went there on business and like everyone who has been there and to Istanbul, far prefer the latter. Ankara is a modern city with a lot less to offer. As we were driving to find the motorway we noticed one of the tyres was losing pressure. There could be only one explanation; a puncture. So what could we do? As we went through a town I spied a taxi, hailed it and asked him to take us to a garage that repairs tyres. We followed him, bless the man, for about 2 euros. Very soon the Mini's tires were being expected. Here is our darling car which, until then, had given us no trouble at all. <br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKoigrNfTQquqPsisUUtEmrFn5TiVSmeh5D5kTiRA9qnf38HCcISQFQMu1YhS_XxUy_CNdY8zUFbbonN_eCnxxVfv2E0gRrqj8-_4ZolniWuCIOzZoEyQA1RUd1DS0K1AthUYP4ai6meGMfQjrLSFKULWtRDlf0yTwdUMH_qEVmhXskSYiuHo/s1600/WhatsApp%20Image%202023-05-25%20at%2005.43.02.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKoigrNfTQquqPsisUUtEmrFn5TiVSmeh5D5kTiRA9qnf38HCcISQFQMu1YhS_XxUy_CNdY8zUFbbonN_eCnxxVfv2E0gRrqj8-_4ZolniWuCIOzZoEyQA1RUd1DS0K1AthUYP4ai6meGMfQjrLSFKULWtRDlf0yTwdUMH_qEVmhXskSYiuHo/w400-h180/WhatsApp%20Image%202023-05-25%20at%2005.43.02.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The Mini's tyres being looked at</i></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>The garage man inspected all 4 tyres, put some pressure in and told us all was well and that we didn't have a puncture. I still don't know why one of them was losing pressure. In any case, after that little adventure, off we went. The motorway to Ankara is amazing with 3 lanes all the way. The only problem is that for at least the first 150km there is not one service station so thank God we had filled the tank before we left Ürgüp.  It poured with rain on a couple of occasions but we made it to Ankara - just over 350 km, by about 2.30. I had booked an apartment in an area called Çankaya - a quiet part in the centre. About 4km away, the sat nav stopped working and oh what a terrible moment with all that traffic. I nearly hailed a taxi again. Eventually the GPS signal came back and shortly we arrived at our new Airbnb. This is <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/547695357055440109?source_impression_id=p3_1684772381_8cOJUQydNaVv1adU">it</a>. If the cave house in Capadoccia was the best accommodation so far, the Airbnb in Ankara was definitely the worst. It was on a 4th floor without a lift and was not very clean. Again we suspected the owner lives there and moves out to stay elsewhere when he gets reservations.  I was rather taken aback by the bathrooms. Both of them had men's urinals and one of them only had a man's urinal. I found that rather offensive. It may be a cultural thing but I found it disgusting. We covered both awful urinals with sheets. The apartment's saving grace was the huge terrace. But if only it had been clean. I have noticed everywhere that hosts hardly ever keep their outdoor spaces clean which is a pity. </div><div><br></br></div><div>At least we had a roof over our heads. But what we most needed was something to eat so took a taxi to a nearby busy street to a restaurant our host recommended. It was great and we had one of the best Turkish meals of our trip, after Sivas. From the little we saw of the city, it seems far more modern than any other place we have been in Turkey and I was pleased not to see so many women with veils or covered up. It's so different in that respect. We met a young man there who spoke perfect English and got talking. Mustafa who is now my "friend" on Instagram, is from Iran, is a teacher of English and has studied international relations. We had a very interesting conversation about the current situation in his country, about Erdogan who has just won the elections again after 22 years in office and about Russia and the Ukraine and the support from the west. He was very critical of the USA so I kept a bit mum. He was surprised I knew about Iran's recent history but of course I did. Who can forget the ousting of the Shah of Persia, the kidnapping at the US Embassy handled by Jimmy Carter which we all saw live on TV or the arrival of Ayatollah Jomeini? He is only 30 so wasn't born there but I wonder what it was like for his parents. He told me that Iran was a great country. I told him I'm sure it is if only women were free. I had to say what I thought. </div><div><br></br></div><div>After parting we then went in search of a good supermarket. We were told to go to "Migros", supposed to be the best supermarket chain but it was not good at all.  We got a few things and then a taxi back and spent the rest of the time in Ankara at the Airbnb. We could have gone to see the main sights of the city but were too tired. I had some good news from Olivia that afternoon. She has been chosen to be the <a href="https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/world-50-best-restaurants-2023-valencia-spain.html">MC in Valencia</a> for this year's "<a href="https://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50">50 Best restaurants</a>" on 22nd June run by the British organisation of the same name. If you haven't heard of them, they are a sort of competition to Michelin stars.  I am hoping to go with her. This is really a feather in her cap as it will be a global event and they needed a bilingual MC with experience. I know they could not have chosen a better person and I am very proud of her. </div><div><br></br></div>We didn't have dinner as lunch had been so late. But I had a glass of Armenian wine while watching the sunset in Ankara with a huge mosque in the distance. It was quite a view. That was all we saw of Ankara, I'm afraid. <br></br><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjam9VhuzKFiXQRN2Xxr-T6EjxqPfED6M11e1tOFySfp5U9BP9ZVRTs738lE9VQg1clY2h84q5JkgkdpAB0qRu6zn0Idsn2uD1cHtC8lG7kps3TVeuH2ylZm9V34_8Ip1QUeUhRrXjzC_PAY6y_seEPzTjdl5y6uVJlE1YeZgAsvsJzRApXXQI/s1600/WhatsApp%20Image%202023-05-25%20at%2005.43.03.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="217" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjam9VhuzKFiXQRN2Xxr-T6EjxqPfED6M11e1tOFySfp5U9BP9ZVRTs738lE9VQg1clY2h84q5JkgkdpAB0qRu6zn0Idsn2uD1cHtC8lG7kps3TVeuH2ylZm9V34_8Ip1QUeUhRrXjzC_PAY6y_seEPzTjdl5y6uVJlE1YeZgAsvsJzRApXXQI/s320/WhatsApp%20Image%202023-05-25%20at%2005.43.03.jpg" width="320"></img></a></div></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><i>Sunset in Ankara as seen from our terrace</i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">I slept so-so that night but Eladio slept like a baby, his shingles receding slowly, thank goodness. I was awake at about 6 am on <b>Thursday</b> which would be our last full day in Turkey. It turned out to be one of the best. We had chosen to go via Bursa, Turkey's 4th largest city, rather than Istanbul which would have been crazy and according to our lovely guide in Capadoccia, Bursa has a lot going for it. It was a 445km drive but the roads were good and we arrived at our <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/47299064?source_impression_id=p3_1684938348_425Z%2FDO9MMhW%2BYEi">Airbnb</a> in the middle of the city by about 2 pm.  We were met by the owner's sister, Seymanur and another woman who helped us take up all our luggage to the attic apartment. Many old houses do not have lifts but oh we loved this place, especially the terrace overlooking the busy streets below and the mountains in the distance but it was too hazy to see them. There has been haze everywhere we have been in Turkey and I kept wondering if it is because of pollution.

Here is Eladio next to one of the many posters we saw of the famous Turkish politician we are no great fans of. </div><div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjTO6OJDNQfrU0rmFwqTvNClUCR4GZ7kVfPBb_r-n9_Eut_demHNQJkDNuds9Bm2iTTjeGh6aS7d9lgxvdTzsb27f-H8_TkBZ23iKSkKr7ukF8r4c7nlmVHWERx60dJ-gV81gsGSI6PjW5XiqbK1rQHIQrx4Qb0BmuoNQDMLqrCEQz_aq-rLe4/s4032/20230525_162916.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjTO6OJDNQfrU0rmFwqTvNClUCR4GZ7kVfPBb_r-n9_Eut_demHNQJkDNuds9Bm2iTTjeGh6aS7d9lgxvdTzsb27f-H8_TkBZ23iKSkKr7ukF8r4c7nlmVHWERx60dJ-gV81gsGSI6PjW5XiqbK1rQHIQrx4Qb0BmuoNQDMLqrCEQz_aq-rLe4/w400-h180/20230525_162916.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio next to Erdogan - Turkey's President</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Much more famous and much more admired by the Turkish population is the one and only Mustafa Kermal Atatürk whose statue Eladio is standing next to in the picture below and which has a dominant position in one of Bursa's many parks <br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjBg9EvkFrakEY4sTJZc-Ndex0E-HhUceKWbbEvUzaIyksu0xzOcPFXTnPMRmoPJwjfSD3iEBBgqSn5076qn_AdLfoX6V9RLjLunxuAsLpFdDLnxWwQtp5HOf3VzRGvD5S6lXpUl346_gbngQHTNlYaHpNucNhI_1eGQCiWPNZdQHGAfSV9GS0/s4032/20230525_163908.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjBg9EvkFrakEY4sTJZc-Ndex0E-HhUceKWbbEvUzaIyksu0xzOcPFXTnPMRmoPJwjfSD3iEBBgqSn5076qn_AdLfoX6V9RLjLunxuAsLpFdDLnxWwQtp5HOf3VzRGvD5S6lXpUl346_gbngQHTNlYaHpNucNhI_1eGQCiWPNZdQHGAfSV9GS0/w400-h180/20230525_163908.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio next to a statue of Ataturk.<br></br></i><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;">I would lay a bet and dare to say there is not one Turkish town that does not have a street or avenue named after him like in Bursa. He was a bit of everything: field marshal, revolutionary politician and  President from 1923 to 1938.  But above all he is known as the founding father of the Republic of Turkey which modernised the country into a secular and industrial nation. Perhaps his greatest claims to fame were providing free and compulsory education and something I always knew; replacing the old Turkish alphabet with the Latin based alphabet. It's interesting to note he made Turkey secular. I'm sure there are some politicians who would love to reverse that. What we noticed that day in Bursa and in many other places is that many people take their Muslim religion very seriously, many women go covered but not all. Every time I saw a girl in western style dress I was happy. As a woman I find it difficult to relate to wearing a burka. I don't think Atatürk would like them either as another of his great achievements was to give Turkish women voting rights and to break the traditional role of women by encouraging them to go to university. He believed that women were important in society and made reforms that gave them equal rights. I hope they are never taken away. That is the one great difference between Turkey and most other Muslim countries. No wonder he is revered. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;"><br></br></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;">From the Atatürk statue we walked along the street of his name towards the 14th century Grand Mosque, the city's most famous landmark. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiG8vOOufHwEvj75PIfAhFyebHAhJ4fdaKcdV1sFqPNrZp-QVJVhgHj514lhyVrhO_Q5kx_cy4jtdgokpx0aUHFFHqLQ1_hWq7T3-A59_bQMN29PJ3c3IYXqABZ4i8rBiCrGLbB7xIC-sfpFVL7Lc6QArbZZNDQyKG4CwJ_CufEZEUlVPtFGKg/s752/0x0-bursas-most-prominent-landmark-the-grand-mosque-1529269822560.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img height="234" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiG8vOOufHwEvj75PIfAhFyebHAhJ4fdaKcdV1sFqPNrZp-QVJVhgHj514lhyVrhO_Q5kx_cy4jtdgokpx0aUHFFHqLQ1_hWq7T3-A59_bQMN29PJ3c3IYXqABZ4i8rBiCrGLbB7xIC-sfpFVL7Lc6QArbZZNDQyKG4CwJ_CufEZEUlVPtFGKg/w400-h234/0x0-bursas-most-prominent-landmark-the-grand-mosque-1529269822560.jpg" width="400"></img></a></div><br></br><span style="text-align: left;">The area was bustling and I especially liked the green park  leading up to it.

I am really not. Anyway, in I went after taking off my shoes and putting on my scarf which now really needs a good wash. Quite a beautiful mosque I thought, famous for its many domes and 4 minarets.

This was the dish - amazing food, perhaps the best we had had in all our time in the country. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></br><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKtG9V-XNeamH4Vivuzwr5xZMxuRG7c-esTTp1bP_xCAvdemPYsyJuB5TKgH8D1Z2lvNWrVtoUaHft2EBovGAxlolGvCqW4OqU2M7FQSt4VcuIHFv3qwWHYAr1V74yNeO5uBbPl3rRFCV6_13AFEuw3opssc8NPvdRRKFmZe3QFa6E-j0J8o0/s1280/maxresdefault.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhKtG9V-XNeamH4Vivuzwr5xZMxuRG7c-esTTp1bP_xCAvdemPYsyJuB5TKgH8D1Z2lvNWrVtoUaHft2EBovGAxlolGvCqW4OqU2M7FQSt4VcuIHFv3qwWHYAr1V74yNeO5uBbPl3rRFCV6_13AFEuw3opssc8NPvdRRKFmZe3QFa6E-j0J8o0/w400-h225/maxresdefault.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Iskander's famous kebab dish, the only food on its menu</i></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">As we left I spied the cooks and had to go up to them to say thank you for the wonderful food.

This is <a href="https://youtu.be/pxElb5HDgak bridge">it</a>. The bridge spans just under 5km and seemed to go on and on forever. Both Eladio and I came away quite impressed with just how much Turkey has progressed when it comes to infrastructure. When I posted photos of the bridge, a friend remarked we were very near Troya.

It makes for a rather strict border given the not so great relations between Turkey and Greece.

It was good to be back in the EU with free roaming and not having to buy local currency. This is all thanks to my Spanish passport, not thanks to Brexit.  It was a good feeling to be back in the EU. Eladio observed the roads were worse than in Turkey. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">Alexandropolis - a seaside town - about 50km from the border, was the place we had chosen to stay the night on our way to Thessalonika. This was our <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/42240104?source_impression_id=p3_1684941995_fXqY7KJ7D1bQomnD">Airbnb </a>which we found after a while. It was one of the better ones. But before settling in, we went in search of food which we had  at a lovely restaurant called <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189509-d2659653-Reviews-Taverna_Loukoulos-Alexandroupoli_Evros_Region_East_Macedonia_and_Thrace.html">Taverna Loukoulos</a>, by the promenade, recommended to us by Giannis, our host. Even though it was past 4 in the afternoon, it was full of Greeks enjoying their food. We enjoyed ours too and were happy to be served wine again. For the record I ordered tsatsiki with pitta bread and then a rib eye steak and Eladio had fish soup and sardines. Just as we were finishing this delicious meal, the heavens opened and it poured and poured so we had to wait to go "home". Once home and after settling in, we both hit the sack on the most comfortable bed of our trip. We woke up at 8.30 pm! We then re planned our trip back deciding on our next destinations. From Thessalonika we are going to Tirana in Albania today. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">On <b>Saturday</b>, thus we were up at the crack of dawn after having gone to bed early.

At home it's never been my favourite supermarket but oh what a joy to find one in Greece where we could buy things not to be found in Turkey, for example ham. We stocked up on fruit and bread - pitta bread for me - but also on ready to make Greek meals including stuffed cabbage rolls (similar to Russian golupsy). I had never been so happy to be at a Lidl as supermarkets in Turkey, for us at least, were not well stocked. Soon we were on our way on a much worse motorway than the ones we experienced in Turkey. Turkey might be a poorer country but infrastructure looks better there than in Greece. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;"><br></br></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">We made it to Thessalonika, Greece's second largest city which is by the sea by about 1.45 and soon found <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/565663266768626164?source_impression_id=p3_1685037985_sDcmr4y8eCm3D9hQ">our little Airbnb </a>which we loved.

My expectations are not high but I know it will be interesting to get just a glimpse of what Albania is like today.
