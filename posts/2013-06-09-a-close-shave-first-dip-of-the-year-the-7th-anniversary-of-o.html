<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Another Sunday
and another blog post but not just any post. I just looked it up and this post
will be number 500 since I started writing this blog in September 2005.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That’s over 7 years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Also I was amazed to see via blogger
analytics this statistic: Pageview all time history 171.271.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Of course it wasn’t like that at the beginning
but today there are some 5000 page visits per month.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Would you please tell me my friends and
readers what you find so interesting about this blog?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Last Sunday
Olivia was returning from her trip to London and it was a very quiet day for us
until I got a whatsapp in the early evening from her boyfriend, Miguel’s
phone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It said: “Mummy, I am Oli. I lost
my sim card … we might miss the plane, the underground line was cut.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Can you please look and see if there are more
Ryanair flights today other than the 7 pm one?”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I left my book by the pool with Eladio,
rushed to my pc and soon found out there were no more flights after 7pm from
any London airport and that their Ryanair flight from Stansted was the last
that day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Their only option was to stay
at a hotel by the airport and buy another ticket to fly back the next day at
09h.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>My adrenaline was running as we
went for our walk with the dogs and I felt frustrated that for once I couldn’t
help my daughter in distress whilst I also had thoughts that this experience –
not the first in her life – could well teach her a lesson.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Whilst I imagined her checking in to some god
forsaken airport hotel at Stansted which must be a terribly boring place, I was
relieved to get a message saying: “We made it but it was a close shave”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This is an expression my girls know very well
ever since they were introduced to Wallace and Gromit and to the very funny
film called “A close shave” when they were children at school.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had never been so happy to read the phrase “a
close shave” than on Sunday last.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was
not able to help her catch her flight of course, but I was able to get a
replacement sim card which thanks to Carolina at Yoigo arrived on Monday
afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It was nice to have Olivia
back but the truth is we hardly saw her until this weekend.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">On Monday
Eladio went off early, as he was to do every day this week, to invigilate UNED
(Open University) exams.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It doesn’t
often happen but this week he caught someone cheating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Eladio recognized a pupil from the previous
year who he suspected of cheating then and this time he took a closer
look.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He walked around the man a few
times and then lifted up some of the papers on his desk and found the evidence:
what is called in Spanish a “chuleta”, a sort of cheat sheet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The man apologized, hoping to get away with
it by saying he hadn’t used the sheet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>But of course he was taken away from the exam room and who knows what
the repercussions will be.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I well
remember using cheat sheets as a student and I am not very proud of myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Some of my better inventions were writing on
my thigh and lifting up my skirt to use what I had written or using a black pencil
case written all over with a blue biro which you could only see at certain
angles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I can only imagine that this
case for Eladio helped to spice up the otherwise very boring activity of
invigilating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The highlight of his week
was when he recognized one of the pupils entering for an exam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw
Pedro, Paula’s boyfriend who is studying Political Science. It was a nice
coincidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I hope Pedro did well in
the exam. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Whilst Eladio
was away I worked from home of course and spent many a morning by the pool
either working or with a book when I wasn’t.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>The weather was great at the beginning of the week and in fact on Monday
it was so warm I decided to take my first dip in the recently opened swimming
pool.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The picture illustrating this week’s
blog is of that moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The experience
didn’t last long as the temperatures plummeted towards the end of the week and
this weekend has been very strange for this time of year; instead of heat, we
are experiencing March like temperatures of 14c and rain too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I have read that June will be colder than
usual and that we are actually heading for the coldest summer in many
years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That pleases my husband from the
north of Spain but not me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<br></br></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Whilst the
temperatures were dropping in Spain, there were floods in central Europe
but my sister and brother in law Pili and Andrés on a package tour in Italy
were lucky with the weather there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
mention their trip because they are not frequent travelers, this trip being possibly
only their second or third abroad since they were married over 25 years
ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Each evening Pili would inform the
family group of Eladio’s brothers and sisters on whatsapp of their trip, using the
wifi at whichever hotel they were staying at and we would normally join the
chat on our walk or after dinner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>They
have had a grand time, although, they, like many tourists in Italy, certainly
experienced what is known as the “Stendhal syndrome” – a sort of fatigue when
exposed to a surfeit of beauty or art which probably happens more in Italy than
anywhere else.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">This week was
not the most productive week work wise and in fact I had a few setbacks in a
very big project I am working on. This had me worried and frustrated most of
the week but thankfully it was all sorted out by Friday and now I will have to
fly to catch up and make sure everything is alright on the day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I wish I could be more explicit but I can’t.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Suffice it to say I always prefer to have my
projects organized and prepared well in advance but sometimes that just can’t
be and when it can’t I have to rely on my own last minute efficiency or on the
last minute efficiency of colleagues and this will be another of those
experiences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

which I wrote on 9<sup>th</sup> June 2006. I well remember just how hot it was
and the removal men dragging the boxes and even the Christmas tree up the path
and Eladio and I rushing around telling them where to put things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I also remember the nightmare of making
everyone’s beds on the first night and how we literally didn’t leave the new

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">Thursday 6<sup>th</sup>
June was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Day_of_Sweden">Swedish National Day</a> and as I had been there recently and love the
country was interested to read the story behind it and which I share with you
here: </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Since 1916, June
6 has been celebrated as Swedish Flag Day. This finally also became Sweden’s
National Day in 1983 and a public holiday from 2005.The date was chosen for two
reasons: the election of Gustav Vasa as Sweden’s king on June 6, 1523, laid the
foundation of Sweden as an independent state; and on the same date in 1809,
Sweden adopted a new constitution that included the establishment of civil
rights and liberties.</span></i><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;"> Some of my Facebook friends posted a picture of the
Swedish flag but Susana’s childhood friend, Erika, whose mother, Gunila, is
Swedish, posted a picture of herself as a child wearing the traditional Swedish
crown of flowers so typical of all their celebrations. She was a beautiful
child and is a beautiful young woman and I thought it fitting that her photo
illustrates the part of this post about the Swedish National Day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></div>

<div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">On Thursday I was
intrigued by a piece of news from the prestigious Medical journal, The Lancet
that stated that <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/345370">Spain was the healthiest country in Europe</a> and one of the top
ones in the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I found it funny that
the Spanish media did not pick up what was for once good news for Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The report which shows how Spain, despite its
economic problems, has the highest life expectance (81.4) and highest average
of healthy years (70.9) concludes that Spain’s high performance is due probably
to four important factors: the climate and Mediterranean diet, an excellent
health system and the fact that families look after their elderly in their
homes rather than sending them off to residences. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I think that is a pretty good conclusion. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>We may complain here about the health system
but I can only say that in my experience it’s pretty good. You can see the full
table of countries in this <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21654536">BBC report</a> where you will read that the UK comes 12<sup>th</sup>
and the USA even lower.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>When I told
Eladio about the report his conclusion was that it is the not the most
developed countries who have the best health.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>He may have a point. I for one look forward to many years of health here,
until I am an old lady in my 90s, in this wonderful country which has become my
own. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;"> So when I read
this week about the latest pastry craze in the US; the <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/arielknutson/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-cronut?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=buzzfeed">cronut</a>, a cross between
a croissant and a donut, which is catching on in the UK, it made me think too
about the difference in diet in these countries compared to Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It seems the cronut maybe the next big thing
after the cup cake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>For me a cup cake is
just an iced bun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I don’t see what all
the fuss is about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>As for the cronut,
well I like croissants and only very occasionally eat a donut, so I’m bound to
try it one day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But if I’m to remain
slim and help Spain’s top ranking in the health league, I think for the moment
I will stick to snacking on black cherries, my favourite fruit which is the
fruit in season at the moment. </span></div>

day of the week, the day everything at work was sorted out, was 7<sup>th</sup>
June, my dear Mother’s birthday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She
would have been 93 and she is still sorely missed. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I always remember her but on 7<sup>th</sup>
June we remember her especially as we do on 1<sup>st</sup> October, the day she
died in 1999, nearly 14 years ago. My Mother’s story is so long and interesting
it is impossible to summarise here. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I
once wrote about her when her beloved sister Masha died and you can read part
of my Mother’s story <a href="http://mashalloyd.blogspot.com.es/2008/11/goodbye-aunty-masha-lieven-story-end-of.html">here</a>. One day I promise I will write a book. She deserves
it as do her grandchildren.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>When I
posted it on FB on Friday, Olivia wrote: “if there was one person I could
bring back to life it would be Grandma”. Me too. </span></div>

figure in NGOs in Spain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>He heads up “Mensajeros

very taken with her. You can watch the report <a href="http://www.rtve.es/television/la-manana-de-la-1/saber-vivir/">here</a> if you fast forward to
10.26h.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Oli later told me that the PR manager
for the local administration tried to thrust a politician at her to be
interviewed too and she had to fight with the woman to get on with her
job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Olivia was not interested in giving
the politician fame for just trying to get into the picture. I totally agree
with her.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;"> While we were at
Zara, Rafa Nadal was battling with Novak Djokovic at the Roland Garros French
Open tennis semi final.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We were
delighted to read that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2013/jun/07/rafael-nadal-novak-djokovic-french-open">Rafa had beaten Djokovic</a> </span><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.5pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 6-7 (3), 9-7 in the most thrilling
match in recent tennis history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Just
afterwards fellow Spaniard, David Ferrer, a top seed tennis player who is much
less known, went on to win his semi final match against France’s Jo-Wilfried
Tsonga by beating him in three straight sets, to get through to his first grand
slam final. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>This crushed all hopes for
the first Frenchman to win the French Open since Yannick Noah in 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I commented to Olivia just how wonderful Rafa’s
win was for Spain’s brand image.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>And
today Sunday, Rafa will be playing Ferrer to make tennis history and become the
only tennis player to win Roland Garros 8 times and the player who has won the
greatest number of a grand slam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It’s a
big day for both of them and the chance for Ferrer to win his first Grand Slam.
For the records, this will be the fourth all Spanish Final in Paris in 19 years
after Sergi Bruguera beat Alberto Berasategui in 1994. Nadal’s fellow Majorcan
and boyhood hero Carlos Moya did the same to Alex Corretja four years later and
in 2002 Albert Costa beat Juan Carlos Ferrero.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>It is true to say that the Spanish tennis players are the kings of the
clay courts. I am sure the French public would far have preferred a Frenchman
in the final as they are probably fed up of their “poorer” neighbours beating
them again and again not just at tennis but at football and cycling too. All the
odds are on Rafa, who still suffers from his knee ailment, to win, but this is
sport and you never know who will win until the end.</span></div>

quiet and not warm either.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Again in Sweden
there were celebrations, this time for the so-called “party princess” <a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/2013/06/08/2630264/swedens-royal-wedding-at-a-glance.html">Madeleine who was marrying the Anglo American banker Christopher O’Neil</a>l. The beautiful
30 year old, the youngest of King Carl XVI Gustav and Queen Silvia’s three
children was married in a grand ceremony at the Royal Chapel which we visited
in Stockholm when I was there recently with a group of journalists. The Swedes,
like the British, are very good at pomp and tradition but the former add a bit
more warmth to the occasion than the latter in my mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>The story of their wedding will fill glossy
magazines the world around and at the same time probably put the problem of
immigrant riots out of the minds of the Swedes whilst they feast their eyes on
the images of this Nordic fairy tale rather than on the ugliness of the riots,
so out of character in civilized Sweden.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;"> On Saturday
afternoon after our walk I went to see Inda. Who is Inda you will want to know?
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Well, let me explain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Inda belongs to Rocío, the girls’ close
friend, and is an adorable 2 month old jet black labrador she puppy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Rocío adores dogs and, like me, was never
allowed to have one when she lived with her parents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So recently emancipated and well employed as
a lawyer with a TV production company, she decided that her first proper
acquisition had to be a dog, or rather a black labrador.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Rocío has been wanting a dog all her life and
on Friday her dream came true, together with the hard part, the toilet training
and all that involves before the puppy knows how to behave. Inda was taken from
her canine family on Friday afternoon to live with Rocío.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>As soon as I saw a picture of the darling, I
knew I had to see her, or it, as soon as possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>If you know me, you will know I love dogs, especially
short haired ones and far prefer to see and hold a puppy than babies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I should explain here that I refer to other
people’s babies, not my own. I never go “ooh and aah” when I see a baby in the
street, reserving that for nearly every dog I see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>So yesterday afternoon I was delighted to be
introduced to Inda.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Olivia was there too
and she took this delightful picture of me with Inda.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;"> I couldn’t
understand why she was wearing glasses in the picture of her with Chati at a
tube station.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Then she told me they are
the trend, the height of fashion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It
seems funny to me to wear glasses for fashion when they are designed for people
who need them to enhance their eyesight and that anyone who needs glasses would
prefer not to wear them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It seems to me
to be a sort of upside down idea, but there you – that’s London fashion for you
I suppose.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Suzy is enjoying
her London experience. She spends a lot of time scouring the net, applying for jobs,
tailoring her cv for the job application as well as the cover letter and I got
many questions from her during the week. Also this week she did her first part
time job with the events catering company.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>Believe it or not it was at a gala dinner held right by the dinosaur at
the wonderful Natural History Museum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I
would love to have seen her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>She will be
home one day soon as she has to come back for documents needed for work
purposes, such as a criminal records certificate, blood test, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I look forward to her coming home.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">Meanwhile Oli has
just gone off to Santiago in Galicia where she will be reporting for TVE1 for
her programme all of next week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We look
forward to watching her on the television as we always do and I will be telling
you about her reports in next week’s post, post 501 for the record.</span></div>

<div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN;">I am now at the
end of this week’s story which I hope you have enjoyed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>It’s been good but there have been difficult
moments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I hope next week will be plain
sailing as I hope it will be for all of you too.</span></div>
