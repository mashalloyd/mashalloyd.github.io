I couldn't have had a better Easter Day with all the family and a birthday celebration thrown in too and what a wonderful day it was.</div><div><br></br></div><div>I didn't sleep much that night but woke up feeling good. Soon our Chinese guests, Echo, Marco and little Junlin were in the kitchen and I was able to get to know them better. They left Shanghai 4 years ago to set up life in Valencia in Spain which must have been a huge cultural shock. Marco explained that both he and his wife were former Chinese secret police but hated their job, I suppose for obvious reasons. I asked if he had been back and he said he didn't want to. I was worried about him missing his family but he told me he had also brought his parents and that his wife's parents will be coming next year. They are here on what is a called a "golden visa" - for an investment of a minimum of half a million euros, foreigners automatically get a golden visa, allowing them to live in Spain. I don't know what a secret policeman's salary is in China is but it must have taken him years to save up. He told me what I already suspected, that many people, who can, leave China as they cannot stand what he called "the politics", meaning I suppose the communist regime. Their son seems to have settled in amazingly. He goes to a British school and speaks fluent Spanish and English besides his native Chinese. As Airbnb hosts, we are privileged to get to know people like Marco and his family and get a bird's eye view of part of their origins and culture. They were here to visit Chinese friends, who, like them, had upped and left the PRC. We had a similar case in the family of "George", "Amanda" and "Lucy" who stayed with us earlier in the year and are now living nearby. Chinese culture is so radically different from European culture, the move these people make has to be provoked by desperation. Imagine uprooting yourself from your country, selling your house and arriving in China to start life from scratch. They certainly have courage and I wish them well. <br></br><p>I then set about making a traditional Sunday roast for Easter day, roast chicken with all the trimmings. I was interrupted by a call from Oli to go and have coffee with them at Alverán. Thus I left Lucy in charge but as she is from Paraguay I would have to be back on time to finish making this very British dish.</p><p>It was great seeing the kids again and we took lots of photos, like this one of me and Eladio with little Juliet, now aged one and a half. She is such a sweetie but I am told she comes into her own at school and has quite a character. So far she can only say Mama and Papa but that day we heard her speak her proper first word and it was "mío" - mine, when Junlin lent her a toy which Elliot grabbed from her to give back to the Chinese boy. She has a good sense of private property hahaha.</p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrCEQNcOEZ9HMJioF2AceMByEQ7_kEoOXHqWWXz8lsR0vCv3RQFuQyirzYcDGET3_r0bsy7Sgpwa1FeUd-l3OkLOkEa4DUYcIwVsOCbYFfzovaIjNSKic-aWtVd34RZmkkoSjuIBJkgsOId18XRaxSg4U4QzBkVaQrN4SQumryC3p-yNmnsuU/s1600/IMG-20230409-WA0002.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrCEQNcOEZ9HMJioF2AceMByEQ7_kEoOXHqWWXz8lsR0vCv3RQFuQyirzYcDGET3_r0bsy7Sgpwa1FeUd-l3OkLOkEa4DUYcIwVsOCbYFfzovaIjNSKic-aWtVd34RZmkkoSjuIBJkgsOId18XRaxSg4U4QzBkVaQrN4SQumryC3p-yNmnsuU/w400-h225/IMG-20230409-WA0002.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Eladio and I with little Juliet at Alverán cafe last Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Elliot had already eaten two mini croissants (vigilantes) by the time we got there and then went and had a third when we ordered our coffees. Obviously he wasn't going to have any of the roast chicken hahahahaha. Here he is playing around at Alverán last Sunday.

I was anxious the Easter day lunch would be ok and it was. Everything was delicious. Before we sat down I got Lucy to take a photo which is today's feature photo. Juliet was asleep so missed being in the photo. She woke up just as we brought in the cake - a surprise for Miguel whose birthday it was last Thursday. So I got a good shot of the 4 of them:<table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5foWq5kesCPYwGUksor_MOkDLj6iJ-lYpmX-774-3LI1TAhQ_43ZH_I0m4dnzGoU_feuQwAMN4gSf-M8zvKg5VJ0SNaVtsps0xmI7Y2FIDc_p0n_pF0Hfa1EdSaSeN01WEQHqUeN97Tl5quJSucrgce_DMba3QLPj9qmEFQxfYyzebGoW86o/s4032/20230409_144242.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5foWq5kesCPYwGUksor_MOkDLj6iJ-lYpmX-774-3LI1TAhQ_43ZH_I0m4dnzGoU_feuQwAMN4gSf-M8zvKg5VJ0SNaVtsps0xmI7Y2FIDc_p0n_pF0Hfa1EdSaSeN01WEQHqUeN97Tl5quJSucrgce_DMba3QLPj9qmEFQxfYyzebGoW86o/w400-h180/20230409_144242.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Celebrating Miguel's birthday on Easter Day</i></td></tr></tbody></table>I took a video too which you can see below. <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe class="b-hbp-video b-uploaded" height="266" src="https://www.blogger.com/video.g?token=AD6v5dxR83rEQ_6BCmWPlFiv9G_uui3XS6dwfONRNIoOaSGVDc0MS9pXVThu0IZPVt6MllsXRBEoAJ8u2zJlyFvvN7YbjppZ2W0NLtAli3XJupyf1wwqpKjIEFQ2QwHtFDCcbg" width="320"></iframe></div><br></br><div><div style="text-align: center;"><i>The cake moment last Sunday</i></div><div>As if we weren't hungry enough, I got out one of the 2 Easter eggs I had bought from The British Corner Shop Online.

If the pool had been open, no doubt we would have gone in the water. The weather is unusually warm for this time of year. It meant we could be together outdoors with the babies. We were joined later by Junlin who made immediate friends with Elliot. They had a grand time together. They both called each other "friends". I got a lovely snap of both of them towards the end of the afternoon. This is it, a snap to be remembered.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiNdp1m8gD9c-LKKcl4bS1qXafmf90tO9unLCwlv9dBFgQNLfzwRz9rih12s9YXVKYWlZB4bsGLdPrL338kSgzmxhGAsHKnnC62DEBA8GxBYWyu3CvqnpTUd0zzwfCqffA5pXZkv0RQkylbD0i7Y68ThusNNJhDFPc0SWEVZZ-U5aHplfXpc1k/s4032/20230409_182226.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiNdp1m8gD9c-LKKcl4bS1qXafmf90tO9unLCwlv9dBFgQNLfzwRz9rih12s9YXVKYWlZB4bsGLdPrL338kSgzmxhGAsHKnnC62DEBA8GxBYWyu3CvqnpTUd0zzwfCqffA5pXZkv0RQkylbD0i7Y68ThusNNJhDFPc0SWEVZZ-U5aHplfXpc1k/w400-h180/20230409_182226.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Junlin and Elliot posing for my camera on Sunday</i></td></tr></tbody></table>Neither Juliet nor Elliot wanted to leave as they were having such a good time but all good things come to an end and off they went leaving Junlin alone. He asked if he could play with their toys so I went with him and we tidied them up together. I later went upstairs to watch the end of Bloodlands while Eladio mowed the front garden in the company of our delightful little Chinese guest.</div><div><br></br></div><div>Dinner was outside again, but just the two of us. We both commented what a wonderful Easter Day we had had. Only Suzy was missing. She was back from Elche on Tuesday.</div><div><br></br></div><div>I slept really well and woke up at 7 am on <b>Monday</b> morning. I was delighted to read in the news over breakfast that the Spaniard Jon Rahm won the 2023 Masters at Augusta, the golf championship that awards the winner with a <a href="https://dknation.draftkings.com/23675380/masters-green-jacket-winner-history-tradition-augusta-national-do-they-keep-it">green jacket</a>. But he can only keep it for a year and will have to give it back to next year's champion unless he wins again. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsMLfDq8DLXTUKc-_wjgVlVZnlQngxfnumgIEgH3vRMtHXDuZHtpYTjoc5BBQDYJLqQGDpmJbFordfo5nTpSR4Bz21c36LxQdOLZQj02qXPtq1zZ8Stbyv24CUdMxPXJmVUOffBC2ZLk68C4x53owxM0dYVndaKzQhFn8f_fQrHxNrOQ4dYU8/s768/JR.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="266" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhsMLfDq8DLXTUKc-_wjgVlVZnlQngxfnumgIEgH3vRMtHXDuZHtpYTjoc5BBQDYJLqQGDpmJbFordfo5nTpSR4Bz21c36LxQdOLZQj02qXPtq1zZ8Stbyv24CUdMxPXJmVUOffBC2ZLk68C4x53owxM0dYVndaKzQhFn8f_fQrHxNrOQ4dYU8/w400-h266/JR.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The very happy Spaniard in his Augusta Masters green jacket after his win there on Sunday last</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br></br></div><div>Amazingly, he won it 40 years after Seve Ballesteros won his second Masters there and on what would have been his 66th birthday (my age). That is quite a coincidence and made the headlines of course. 28 year old Rahm , the 2021 US Open Champion and now the world's number one, is the fourth Spaniard to win at Augustus after Ballesteros, Olazabal and Sergio García. I was happy for him and for Spanish sport. Spain usually wins at football and tennis but winning the Masters at Augusta is a feather in the cap of for Spanish golf; it really is. It definitely looks like Seve Ballesteros has a great heir in Rahm and Rahm knows it as Seve is his hero. </div><div><br></br></div><div>I'm sure our Chinese guests weren't at all aware of this win, their priorities elsewhere. Is golf big in China I wonder? It's more ping pong (sorry table tennis) isn't it? They were leaving that day and were very sorry to leave as they loved our house. If when they came the husband, Marco - the ex Chinese secret policeman - said our home was like Downton Abbey (hahahaha), the morning they left, the couple asked for permission to film and take photos of the house. That was fine by me. They asked me so many questions about the house, it felt like they wanted to buy it but it's not for sale. We said our fond goodbyes and took pictures to record their stay here. This is one of them with Echo, Marco and little Junlin. We get so many guests I don't remember all of them; I can't, but some make their mark like this lovely Chinese family. We won't forget them and hope they come back.</div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgc4qiGxLVmFGyD-nvXGHFCNvhRfTzyfdOrNGuOrTarClcQry84Qrpv9AaR2hwLvXmWLiZFLjQWTYuW183ZyH_iZC22hDauwPlaI6mGPJ6yF9e7ZNsi4pjTGqLFrfLsjfnFzpRhOsVOjztxhsLTP6M9tzT3atWU2ZG-vV-ql8nAZxpiB-eUafc/s4032/20230410_105144.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgc4qiGxLVmFGyD-nvXGHFCNvhRfTzyfdOrNGuOrTarClcQry84Qrpv9AaR2hwLvXmWLiZFLjQWTYuW183ZyH_iZC22hDauwPlaI6mGPJ6yF9e7ZNsi4pjTGqLFrfLsjfnFzpRhOsVOjztxhsLTP6M9tzT3atWU2ZG-vV-ql8nAZxpiB-eUafc/w400-h180/20230410_105144.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>A photo with our Chinese guests just before they left on Monday</i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>Monday was the day we made our annual visit to the Verdecora gardening centre to stock up on geraniums and hydrangea for the swimming pool area and front garden. Some of the plants survive the winter and some don't so we always have to get some new ones. Eladio, my gardener, also needed soil of different types that come in huge 70 liter bags. My still very strong husband had no issues putting them on the trolleys or into the boot of the car.

I left him to it. I am not a gardener but do appreciate his work. </div><div><div><br></br></div><div>Lunch was on the patio and it was just us. We ate the Easter day roast lunch leftovers - no complaints. I spent a lazy afternoon watching  <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0f29n6l">Magpie Murders</a> while my husband worked. We met again at dinner - again on the patio. That night I had record sleep - just under 8 hours which is like a miracle for me. </div><div><br></br></div><div>I was up at 7.30 on <b>Tuesday </b>morning, the day Suzy was coming home from Elche. It was a quiet day. That morning after some gentle reminders from Eladio, I set about creating lists for the "trip of our lifetime". There are 4 main categories: Documents, food and drink, clothing and toiletries and finally "other stuff to take". It's the other stuff to take that takes up the room, including our picnic chairs and table. I might have to downsize at some stage if everything is to fit into my Mini. Writing the lists made the trip more real. On our walk after coffee at home that day, Eladio asked if I was feeling excited about the trip. Well, of course I am. I love adventure and discovering new places and as I have said many times, we have to make the most of the quality time we have left before we are too old. </div><div><br></br></div><div>As I said too , we had a quiet day which included our walk. We were looking forward to dinner with Suzy but she wasn't back until after 9pm. I was already in bed and watching the news when she got back. It was good to see her again. </div><div><br></br></div><div>The big news on Tuesday in the UK was Joe Biden's visit to Belfast to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday peace agreement. Before he left on Air Force One he said it was his priority to "keep the peace" in Northern Ireland. I'm not sure he will convince the Unionists to back Sunak's Windsor Framework, the updated and post Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjC3B_wcZjxThNvQ6dHGlmQdhTW1Dy6E0Ng-FUmin3DZXauVa3bm9LD-e3yE5MxQyJ4iRDF_KKb8eaCYgsEdy1xKAJiSAKCP804_hw_LVag-TQ3wAjoQYkYau_nio3rOt1Bnua7QB2i8-ULMu3QCD-vV6kjdvvE_TximuCZAwtLK2BygTSJrzs/s8640/_methode_times_prod_web_bin_b6a6994e-d8ac-11ed-80bc-e358583c5d62.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="266" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjC3B_wcZjxThNvQ6dHGlmQdhTW1Dy6E0Ng-FUmin3DZXauVa3bm9LD-e3yE5MxQyJ4iRDF_KKb8eaCYgsEdy1xKAJiSAKCP804_hw_LVag-TQ3wAjoQYkYau_nio3rOt1Bnua7QB2i8-ULMu3QCD-vV6kjdvvE_TximuCZAwtLK2BygTSJrzs/w400-h266/_methode_times_prod_web_bin_b6a6994e-d8ac-11ed-80bc-e358583c5d62.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Joe Biden arriving in Belfast on Tuesday evening in an historic visit to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday peace agreement. </i></td></tr></tbody></table><br></br><div>But he would only be there for half a day, spending 3 more days in the Republic of Ireland. It therefore seems his main mission was to explore his Irish roots of which he is most proud. His great great great grandfather, Edward Blewitt was born in County Mayo. I can't criticise him for that. Remember my trip to Anglesey  in 2019 where my grandfather was born? The last Irish Catholic US President, JF Kennedy did just the same thing in 1963 (a few months before he was assassinated) and later told aids it was the "best four days of my life".  It was the same for Joe Biden, the oldest US President in history. But let's hope his presence is a force for good in Northern Ireland too. </div><div><p>I certainly understand his nostalgia and interest in his roots. It is something that lives with me; my English and Russian roots, the stories of my father and mother and that's why the stop off in Sofia, Bulgaria, next month will be so important to me. </p><p>That too is why dinner on <b>Wednesday </b>was to be so special. Richard Nurekar was my father's pupil at Bradford Grammar School and we had been in touch after my father's 100th birthday when so many "old boys" sent cards. That was unforgettable. Richard was in Madrid with his wife to see his daughter who has been studying here as part of her French and Spanish degree at Leeds Uni and so we agreed to meet and I invited them to dinner this week. Richard studied Russian at Oxford but became a very important athlete in long distance running. From what I know he was inspired by the one and only <a href="https://memories.net/timeline/selby-brock-71911">Selby Brock</a>, my father's colleague, the head of cross country running but also Master of both maths and history.   I was really looking forward to meeting him, mainly of course to hear his memories of my father. He must have been one of his last Russian pupils  as he finished school in 1982 and my father retired the following year. I was interested to know too why Richard had studied Russian. </p><p>I also made a list for the dinner menu; something Spanish and something English which included Spanish tortilla as part of the main course and Eton mess for dessert.</p><p>That's what I was thinking about when I woke up on Wednesday morning. It was to be another beautiful day but the temperature would only rise as high as 23ºc which had me wondering whether we could eat outside or not. </p><p>The garden was looking good as Eladio had mowed both the back and front lawns. </p><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCNkmUddLsEvJfjyMLMpzAY3WI8XuPq8H4udj_uoKYnFnyp2jW_ePIgPBTfMNHL45oDySSvl7h5jUShq6CjPTV09yXIeNkl8GOt4A076PnNk5RLrGrCn7u6TTWfdEA9dMEGG8kFI6lHKppifBvNvbKAeffqtJYuUXeBZw7u46IN8D8i05N7YY/s4032/20230412_085654.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjCNkmUddLsEvJfjyMLMpzAY3WI8XuPq8H4udj_uoKYnFnyp2jW_ePIgPBTfMNHL45oDySSvl7h5jUShq6CjPTV09yXIeNkl8GOt4A076PnNk5RLrGrCn7u6TTWfdEA9dMEGG8kFI6lHKppifBvNvbKAeffqtJYuUXeBZw7u46IN8D8i05N7YY/w400-h180/20230412_085654.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>Nothing lovelier than a freshly mowed lawn. </i></td></tr></tbody></table>However, the pool was looking awful. But thankfully, Javier, the swimming pool maintenance man and Danilo his helper from El Salvador, came to remove  the ugly tarpaulin that covers it in the winter. There was a pool of green water on it full of leaves - quite unsightly I'm afraid. I kept thinking maybe we should keep it open all year if only for the sake of how it makes the house look. The water was in such a bad state when the revealed the cover, that Javier persuaded us to keep the pool open all year which is just what we are going to do.

I hope so. </div><div><br></br></div><div>I was interested to meet someone from El Salvador, that most violent of Central American countries. I had heard of the recent martial law to crack down on violence where up until recently between 60 and 80 people were killed daily by Latin bands, mostly the Maras. Danilo told me he left El Salvador because of that and described how anyone setting up a business had to pay the bands and if they didn't their families were put in danger. He is in favour of martial law which has made his small country, the size of Madrid with a population of 7 million people, a lot safer. <br></br><div><br></br></div><div>We left him to it to do more shopping  mostly for the dinner but also because we were running low on stocks despite two food shops last week.

Suzy later commented how extraordinary it was that an ex pupil of his from the 80's would want to come and see us. The answer could only be the extraordinary influence he had on some of his pupils, like Richard. That fills me with pride and joy. Bradford Grammar School was and is a very special place. As I explained to Richard, the school came across my blog, wanting to  include one of my posts in the BGS magazine when my father turned 90. This   caused countless "old boys" to write to my father through me.   Since then so many, like Richard, reached out while he was alive, on his 100th birthday, when he died on 8th November 2021, when we held his funeral last year in Bradford on 6th May, and they still write today. I explained to Suzy after the dinner, that it was through his old boys that I got to see a different side to my father, the amazing and supposedly dynamic and entertaining teacher, who I never saw at home. At home my mother stole his thunder and he was generally very quite, unassuming and incredibly modest. I still can't quite fathom the influence he had on so many of the boys he taught from 1964 to 1983. I am absolutely sure he was not at all aware of his impact on these boys who are now in their 60's and 70's and who still remember him. Richard told me he that although he taught them the Russian language, he spent a lot of his class time talking about a hundred other interesting things, imparting global knowledge to them which inspired so many of them. Thanks to BGS and to his old boys, I wrote his book, interviewed him and got to tell his whole story. When I was young and he was teaching them, I wasn't interested in what he did in the war or how he taught spies in Cambridge and I didn't think it was anything special that he married a Russian princess who didn't seem like one to me. It was only when he was reaching 100 that I was finally interested and was able to understand his life and what he did for his country and for pupils like Richard. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Dinner around the dining room table where Suzy presided, sitting in her grandfather's place, was fun, lively and we all had so much to say to each other and frankly, we got on like a house on fire and made new friends. What an international night it was, one to be remembered for a long time. We took more photos too which I shall treasure.

God bless you Daddy. You were with us on Wednesday night in heart and spirit. At the end of the evening, I was honoured to give Richard and his lovely family a signed copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/BIOGRAPHY-C-COURTENAY-LLOYD/dp/1916467997">my book</a>. Eladio took them back to the station in the roomier Volvo and Suzy and I retired to her room to have an after dinner chat. We had had a wonderful night, a night to be remembered. <div><br></br></div><div>When I posted pictures, people who follow athletics,  commented that Richard holds the British record for 10 miles of 46:02 which he set in 1993. Apparently he then moved up distances to running marathons and won his debut marathon in Hamburg after which he won his second, the World Cup Marathon, in Spain - btw - in that gorgeous Basque city, San Sebastián, in 1993.  I knew none of this when he got in touch with me a while back. So we really had an illustrious guest with us on Wednesday, also my father's pupil and now a friend. We loved his family, his wonderful wife Gail and beautiful and talented daughter Almi. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Wendesday was the absolute highlight of the week as you can imagine. After all, it's not often you host a former pupil of your father's who is such an important athlete too. <b>Thursday</b> was a much quieter day with little to report. Part of it was spent on more planning for our journey and a lot of the afternoon setting up  a new phone for Eladio as his had broken unfortunately. I was able to use Smart Switch and after a few tries, had his new phone restored. It's a mid tier Samsung, the A32 5G which is fine. There is no point in buying the latest for 4 times the price. I then had to set up his smart watch and also link payment via the watch and the phone. I considered myself quite an expert after that. It was a bit stressful but if truth is to tell I quite enjoyed the exercise. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Dinner was a simple affair but appreciated by all. I made pasta with mushroom sauce which I invented, based on the ingredients I had: basil, pine nuts, pistachios, mushrooms and soy cream which we had with tagliatelle. If I had had fresh basil and enough pine nuts I could have pesto sauce. I was inspired to make pasta after seeing our Italian guest, Stefano, make a pasta dish nearly every day since he came to stay. </div><div><br></br></div><div>I slept better that night and woke up full of beans on <b>Friday</b> morning. Reading The Times, I came across the description of the <a href="https://www.royalcollectionshop.co.uk/the-coronation-coffee-mug.html?nosto=productcategory-nosto-1">official Buckingham Palace coronation collection</a>. You may not know that I have a  collection of royal mugs started probably by my great grandparents. The oldest mug is of Edward VII, the son of Queen Victoria who reigned from 1901 to 1910. I have mugs of the Kings and Queens but also their offspring. My grandmother, mother and I continued the collection. It includes some of the last Queen's "children",  who all got divorced, as we know, except for Edward. So, on Friday I bought the coffee mug for King Charles III's coronation on 6th May next. This is it. <br></br><div><br></br></div><div><div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgub1L5N2tEgVjsM5Uf7HLmys_ILT85gh0-2urvPpyQ5r3kaeEt9bckypvwPjFtQhHVmK00YoXQUOPtSM7o_wCej_8_HKL0q90Xpk2yaOArZvZZUznuN9iKi-JTvt6O2eQsUg2jUilzDw_j7y3PDhviBSTOh5BfE1KBX_nQT1V6P1KxRSVXlx4/s750/102277.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgub1L5N2tEgVjsM5Uf7HLmys_ILT85gh0-2urvPpyQ5r3kaeEt9bckypvwPjFtQhHVmK00YoXQUOPtSM7o_wCej_8_HKL0q90Xpk2yaOArZvZZUznuN9iKi-JTvt6O2eQsUg2jUilzDw_j7y3PDhviBSTOh5BfE1KBX_nQT1V6P1KxRSVXlx4/w400-h400/102277.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The new Coronation mug to add to my collection of royal mugs started by my great grandmother. </i></td></tr></tbody></table>I sometimes wonder what will happen to my collection and all our English furniture and family memorabilia when I pass away.

While there I updated mine for my lovely but slightly chipped Samsung Galaxy S20 FE and my husband invested in a new hands' free device for the Volvo. We came home to find Oli there and sat down to lunch as a family. We were interrupted by a painter who had come to patch some parts of the wall in my father's old room. There had been a leak from the shower which Eladio had fixed but it hasn't dried yet. More worryingly the painter found an even bigger leak which must come from a pipe from the upper floor. We only saw all the damage  and it was massive, when the painter and his "mate" moved two of my father's huge book shelves. A plumber is coming on Monday but I hope all can be sorted before we leave next Friday. Meanwhile I offered a different room to Pilar, a recurring guest, but she preferred my father's room for some reason. I have had to block  the room calendar until further notice which is a big inconvenience.</div><div><br></br></div><div>So we didn't spend much time with Oli who had to leave to pick up the kids. I hope we will see them today. The rest of the day was incident free.</div><div><br></br></div><div><b>Saturday</b> dawbed and a chap came to see the house, or rather the garden and pool, for a possible event he wants to hold - his birthday. He is of course looking at other places too. He arrived early and found me in my dressing gown. I had got so engrossed on our route map planning I hadn't yet had a shower or got dressed. He's English and didn't mind. I thought he was a lovely young man and I hope he chooses our house. If he doesn't, it's not the end of the world. </div><div><br></br></div><div>Route planning took up nearly all day. We of course know our final destination - Georgia and Armenia but wanted to plan where we may or may not stay, places on the way that are interesting. </div><table class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgm8A4Jm6zMTexMXqxJcs5swPNM3B7XjIIoWpNuIIFx47XuCduqa-VTXQkDGbeEbX3JXvN0rKnV_55K2VqjqrObdDefweRYDad-7ZsugDBq3Li2IevH7QUbM9O5lkG_WkAjRJ3QH4ihVz-j5-cyeGCL3F93MWB8YWQ7OA0eYUdXO8kvkazG9Uc/s4032/20230103_092000.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img height="180" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgm8A4Jm6zMTexMXqxJcs5swPNM3B7XjIIoWpNuIIFx47XuCduqa-VTXQkDGbeEbX3JXvN0rKnV_55K2VqjqrObdDefweRYDad-7ZsugDBq3Li2IevH7QUbM9O5lkG_WkAjRJ3QH4ihVz-j5-cyeGCL3F93MWB8YWQ7OA0eYUdXO8kvkazG9Uc/w400-h180/20230103_092000.jpg" width="400"></img></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><i>The direct route from Madrid to Armenia</i></td></tr></tbody></table><div><br></br></div><div><b>This is what the outbound route is looking like as far as Istanbul.</b></div><div><br></br></div><div>Madrid - Blanes (Girona)</div><div>Blanes - Biot/Antibes (France)</div><div>Biot - Garda (Italy)</div><div>Garda - Venice (or near) (Italy)</div><div>Venice - Ljubliana (Slovenia)</div><div>Ljubliana - Zagreb (Croatia)</div><div>Zagreb  - Sarajevo (Bosnia) </div><div>Sarajevo - Pristina (Kosovo)</div><div>Pristina - Skopje (North Macedonia)</div><div>Sofia (Bulgaria)</div><div>Sofia - Istanbul (Turkey)</div><div><br></br></div><div>From Istanbul we shall make our way across Turkey along the Black Sea coast till we get to the Sarpi crossing into George.
