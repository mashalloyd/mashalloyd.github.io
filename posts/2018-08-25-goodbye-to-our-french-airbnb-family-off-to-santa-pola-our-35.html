<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Hi everyone,</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Here I am writing from our apartment in Gran Alacant, near Santa Pola. We have been here since Monday and so far have had a great time. </span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Last Sunday was the last day with our French guests who left our house in Madrid yesterday in our absence. They have been the very best of guests, in my top 10 and their little girl, 8 year old Marianne, together with 7 year old Brody from the UK, my favourite guests of all time. </span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">As we were leaving for Santa Pola the next day, Eladio spent the whole morning mowing the lawn. Meanwhile I went on our walk alone with Pippa. I also made the lunch; my sort of coq au vin. My French family went off to the Rastro, the famous Madrid flea market where we haven't been for years. We must go again one day. I spent part of the afternoon reading until I was interrupted by Marianne who came to be with me. We played games on my phone together, took photos and she created a lot of fun videos; at least 50 haha. She is quite the little actress. Here are we are together that afternoon.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">She only speaks French and wow does she speak it fast so I have had to respond the best I could and my goodness my French improved a lot while she was with us. So much so I am thinking of taking French lessons this year. Will I do it? I'd love to. </span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Marianne was very excited to know that Olivia was coming for dinner that night, together with Miguel. She adores Olivia. Well she seems to adore a lot of things in life, especially our dogs and I just love her overall enthusiasm. As that evening would be our last together I wanted to give her a special present; a photo of her with Elsa and Norah which I would frame and wrap up; a photo for her room for her to remember her stay here always. Miguel was on hand to oblige as he is such a good photographer. This is the photo he took.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">She was delighted with the gift. Then we had another photo, this time with her 17 year old brother, Clement who she also adores,  Oli and I with her holding the treasured photo. That one I shall frame to remember them. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">For dinner that night I made "tortilla", Spanish omelet to which I added spinach. We had it with a leafy salad. The best thing was being together. We would be seeing Oli in Santa Pola where she would join us at the end of her stay.  And here are Eladio, Oli and Miguel around the table that night. It was another wonderful summer dinner al fresco with Oli and Miguel. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Later we invited our French family to join us for a glass of wine around the table  as it was our last night with them. And there we were talking a mixture of French, Spanish and English and getting along wonderfully together. When I said goodbye on Monday I told them they couldn't just disappear out of our lives that they must come back again. I hope they do.  So it was late to bed on Sunday night for us but it had been a very enjoyable evening.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I was up before it dawned on Monday as is customary.  I had to pack and take food and lots of wine for our friends. I would do the proper food shopping on Tuesday morning in Santa Pola. We left at around 11.15 after saying goodbye to our French family, my Father and Lucy. Hopefully everything would be alright in our absence. We stopped for lunch at the Parador in Albacete on our way; on the cafeteria terrace rather than the restaurant so as to be able to have Pippa with us. The menu was a bit lacking in choice and the meal rather expensive but a great location, right by the Parador pool. </span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We got to Gran Alacant, the "urbanización" meaning a private residential area which is actually very sprawling. It is located between Alicante and the town of Santa Pola and on cliffs above the beach and from where you can see the bay of Alicante. We have had this small and modest apartment since 1999 and bought it with my Motorola severance pay. It's not worth much these days but we love coming here. It's like a small home away from home.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We soon settled in and, as always, when we arrive we spent time cleaning and putting things away, making the beds, etc. Eladio cleaned all the windows which is a mighty job but he wanted everything to be spick and span for our friends, Kathy and Phil who were coming the next day.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Finally our jobs were finished by about 7 pm after which we spent time on the terrace reading. Later we had a light supper of leftover "tortilla" with salad while watching the news. I was not happy to hear there had been 2 more earthquakes in Lombok near Bali where Suzy lives. She messaged us to say she had felt them and that people had panicked but that she was ok. Uff. </span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Thanks to our Amazon Fire Stick we are able to watch TV streaming from the flat and our choice of film was on Netflix that night, "Safe House" a CIA thriller. It was good but by about 11 pm both of us were falling asleep and had to go to bed. </span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Tuesday came and it wasn't just any Tuesday It was 21st August which was the day we married and thus it was our anniversary. It was a special one too as this week we have been celebrating 35 years of marriage. Imagine, 35 years, that's a very long time.  I was just 26 the day I married and now I am 61! Where did time go?</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">All I can say is that it's been 35 years of a very good marriage. I feel a little bit like a dinosaur as there is so much divorce and separation around me. Not many marriages these days last so long. I also feel lucky I met the man of my life when I did and went ahead and married him. I have never regretted it. I'm not saying life is perfect. It never is but in the balance of things I think our marriage is as good as it gets. Thank you Eladio for putting up with me all these years and for loving and taking care of me. I hope you can say the same of me. The secret to our successful marriage I always think is down to mutual admiration, mutual respect, giving each other space, no jealousy, similar values and of course enjoying the small things of life together. Here's to many more years together. What would my life be without Eladio? I cannot envisage it. Happy anniversary my beloved.</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We didn't do anything special to celebrate on Tuesday as our friends were arriving a bit too late for dinner out. But don't worry we would celebrate in style with dinner out to somewhere really special on Wednesday night.</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We didn't go to the beach or the pool and missed a walk that day. Instead we went to Mercadona to stock up for our friends stay. This would include lots of wine and beer which they love. The only thing I did really was to take Pippa down to the garden occasionally. We had it to ourselves. We could have gone to the pool but dogs are not allowed (Spain is such an unfriendly dog country!) but Eladio isn't keen and I suppose I am not really either as we are both spoiled having our own private pool at home. However I do like the gardens and the position of the pool looking out right over the sea and beyond to the bay of Alicante. We would go to the beach on Wednesday with our friends, but early to avoid the hottest part of the day.</span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We came home from Mercadona and unloaded all the shopping. Lunch would be leftovers I had brought from Madrid which meant I didn't have to cook. </span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Eladio slept a long siesta. I, meanwhile, spent the time on our lovely little terrace reading. Our terrace is the apartment's salient point. It's wonderful because it's sunny in the morning but shady in the afternoon. Also, as we are on a cliff, the Levante wind protects us from the heat. Here we had our "afternoon tea", well, rather a plate of fruit with some nutritious and natural nuts which I'm sure my daughters would approve of.</span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Meanwhile, Oli and Miguel had gone away to his parents' flat in the small town of Madrigal de la Vera, a pretty place in the province of Cáceres. From the photo it looks like they visited a natural pool, something we would do too later in the week. </span></div>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Our friends who were flying from Leeds  Bradford airport were arriving at just past 8.30 pm so we left with what we thought was plenty of time. However we hadn't been to Alicante airport for years and my has it changed and grown since then. You can no longer drop people off or pick them up and have to park the car in the public car park which is quite a walk to the terminal. Thus we missed them arriving. We found each other in the end. Getting out of the airport was a bit like a scene from a Mr.  Bean episode. Everything is automated these days and it took a while to find where to pay and how to get out of the now rather gigantic airport. </span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We were home soon though as the airport is only about 8 km from our apartment. Our friends were hot and probably tired but soon they were in cooler clothes, had unpacked and settled in to their modest little room and by about 10 pm we were cooling off on the terrace. We had drinks before dinner, during dinner and after dinner too hahaha. Amazingly I did not get a headache that night. Dinner was my special prawn cocktail with mango which we all wolfed down. I showed them later the lovely views from the flat of the bay of Alicante and then outlined our programme for the week. It was going to be full of activity. My plan was approved so a good time was to be had by all. That night we went to bed well past midnight and I didn't get much sleep as I was awake on Wednesday morning just before 6 am! </span></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">The next morning I was up at 5.56 and while everyone slept I had my first coffee of the day and wrote a little bit of this post. We had an early breakfast so as to get down to the beach before the crowds arrived. </span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">It is August and this is the busiest month here. If you come in June or September it's relatively quiet and of course not so hot. We wanted to go the beach early so as to avoid the midday heat. Thus we were able to park quite easily and also find a spot on the front row. And here are our English friends with Eladio sitting on our 19 year old beach chairs which have lasted extraordinarily well hahaha. </span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Kathy and I were the first ones in the water and it was calm and lovely. Later the men went in too. Our idea was to sit for a while, take a few dips, then walk to the end of the natural beach - the one with no buildings - and back, swim again and at around 12 leave while most people were arriving. </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">That is what we did. Once home, the gasman had come to do the annual check up of the gas boiler while Phil, Kathy and I went to the pool. I was the only one to take the plunge there. </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Having only bathroom in the apartment is a bit of a challenge when 4 people need a shower but it wasn't a problem as I went last while preparing everyone's lunch. We had Lucy's Paraguayan bean stew followed by fresh grilled hake with basil and garlic and asparagus. We didn't really want to eat too much as that night we would be having a big dinner at La Finca restaurant in Elche.</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">The afternoon was spent at leisure and we didn't leave the apartment. I tried to sleep a siesta but didn't get a wink's sleep.  We wanted to leave at 8 pm for La Finca so as to get there before dusk and appreciate the surroundings. Kathy and I dressed up for the occasion. I hadn't really brought any smart clothes for Eladio but at least Phil was wearing long summer trousers. Before we left we had a little photo shoot in the Mediterranean gardens of our apartment block. These would be our pre-dinner photos and here they are. </span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We were all excited about our dinner at La Finca that night. <a href="https://www.lafinca.es/en">La Finca</a>, run and owned by a famous Spanish woman chef, Susi Diez who is a self taught chef, is a one Michelin star restaurant tucked away on an unknown road about 2 km from Elche and if you don't know it you'd never find it. I discovered it before it became famous many years ago when we got lost on our way to Elche. We went there with the girls in about the year 2001, loved it but never went back mostly because it's rather expensive. Since then its fame has risen and it's well on the Spanish culinary map for foodies. We didn't get lost this time and arrived just before sunset and were able to appreciate the gardens which are the highlight of the location. There we took some more photos and I chose the one of us arriving for this week's post. Thanks Kathy for being our photographer.</span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">I </span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">have to say though that they were not the clicking heel type you get at stuffy and starchy top restaurants. La Finca is well run and is a top class restaurant but everything is both smooth and relaxed. The food has evolved since we came and in true Michelin star style it comes with lots of tiny little snack like dishes which in themselves are a work of art. We were to experience a creative culinary experience I think we will all remember. </span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We were well and truly full by then but even more was to come, a dish of peti fours or something similar which came in a very creative platter which looked a bit like a big light bulb. </span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">All in all it was a magnificent menu and dinner. I should mention too the drinks.

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Our amazing culinary experience came to an end at about 11.30 as all good things do tend to come to an end and we all got into the car saying how much we had enjoyed the evening and that it was well worth the money - about 100 euros each. That is inexpensive really for a 1 Michelin star restaurant. I suggested to Eladio we go back at least once a year as the place is just amazing.</span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Thursday was going to be another lovely day but very hot and thus tiring. We had good news that day from Suzy. Thanks to my friend Jackie who, by the way, also lives in Spain and reads my blog, my older daughter who went to live in Bali in June, has now got a new job teaching English online for a Chinese company. On the Tuesday she had a test lesson where a recruiter simulated being a 7 year old boy who spoke no English. She got dressed up for the role and trial skyped me first. I had no idea what she was up to but it sounded like an interesting prospect as it means she can work from anywhere. Here she is ready for the simulated lesson with the recruiter.

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">She later told us the simulated test lesson was great fun and that she actually loved every minute of it. So, maybe, like her grandparents and father she could have the makings of a teacher. I would find that a great coincidence; Suzy the teacher. Well, it was on Thursday morning she got the call to say they had accepted her. She was ecstatic because it means a regular income and also that she can work from anywhere in the world. Thus she could come "home" to Spain for longer periods. Whoopee Suzy, so happy for you and Jackie I thank you from the bottom of the heart. </span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">That news was the best piece of news of the week or month. It was a great start too to a lovely day with our friends from England. </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">The first agenda on Thursday's programme was a visit to the local market here at Gran Alacant. It's just across the way from our apartment and we went early at about 9.30 before it got hot or was full of people. I knew Kathy and Phil would love it and they did. Phil bought clothes as did Kathy and even I did - that doesn't surprise you. I bought some fake Nike pink trainers and a blouse and amazingly Eladio bought a hat. When I saw it, he looked like he was about to go on a safari so I marched him back to the stall to change it for a normal looking Panama hat hahahah.</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">The market sells excellent fruit and veg which is mostly locally produced and I love buying it there. I love it so much I go behind the stalls and pick and choose myself; as do lots of other people. Here I am holding an in season nectarine and enjoying the moment.</span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We bought mostly in season fruit: greengages, black figs, melons and water melon. The latter was, to quote Eladio at dinner on Thursday evening, "sublime" and it was</span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Happy with our purchase, we took them home, picked up Pippa and went off again. The next item on the agenda or programme was a trip to the small island of Tabarca which would be our third visit this year. August is not the best month to go as hordes of tourists do the same, plus it would be very hot. But beggars can't be choosers and we wanted to share our newly discovered little island with our friends. </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">The boat trip is an integral part of it which we all enjoyed, except Pippa I think who doesn't feel at home on a boat. The trip is just half an hour and by about 12.30 we landed.</span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We took our friends and Pippa on a very hot walk around the island which took well over an hour. I have no longer got a fitbit but Kathy told us we did five miles that day; 8 km which is not bad.</span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">However, we all suffered from the heat and the dust and looked like something the proverbial cat had brought in when we got home later in the afternoon. After our hot but thankfully breezy walk, we ambled back into the old village looking for shade to walk in. Pippa looked for Phil's shadow to follow! We had to keep giving her water and even pouring it over her. I mean, if we were hot, she must have been boiling as she has a coat of hair. I can't imagine walking around Tabarca in 35c with a fur coat on can you?</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">By 1.30 or so we arrived at Casa Gloria where I had booked a table on the terrace by the sea. Thankfully the breeze was quite strong and were given a corner table which was probably the coolest table there. Eladio, Phil and I had a "fideua" (like paella but instead of rice the main ingredient is thin pasta like vermicelli). Sorry no photo but we dug into it immediately as we were so hungry. We had an ice cream or beer and wine for Kathy and Phil at a bar in the main square run by Patricia the "philosophy student" I wrote about some time ago. It was nice to greet her and my was she busy. I have never seen the island so full. It's much better to go out of season. We caught the 15.45 catamaran back to Santa Pola and semi slept on the way. I think Pippa was the most shattered of us all poor thing.</span><br></br>
<br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Once home we were all in need of a shower and change of clothes - I would wash everything we had worn as it was so dusty - and  a rest of course. Pippa had a bath too as I didn't want her dusty paws on the sofas, plus she needed to cool off. It actually cooled off outside too when there was the lurking of a thunder storm and we even had a few drops of rain but only for a few minutes. By 7 pm I was nodding off and just had to have a nap before dinner. I also had a headache, probably from the sun, which wouldn't leave me so off I went to bed. I slept for 2 hours and woke up with a blinding headache which I thought might turn into a migraine but thankfully it didn't.</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">That evening we had a light dinner; gazpacho, tuna salad and water melon after which my headache magically went away. I slept like a baby that night only waking up once in the night and was awake on Friday morning, late for me, at 7 am.</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Friday was to be a trip down memory lane and the highlight of our stay. I wanted to share with our friends my old haunts from our "Callosa Days". They were our long summer holidays in Spain in the Alicante area when my parents bought an hold house for a song in Callosa de Ensarria and my Aunt bought another one in the small village of Bolulla in 1973.  We set off early to make a day of it and by about 11 we were in Callosa, that sleepy Spanish mountain town a bit off the tourist track. Here I took my friends to the old ice cream parlour , La Jijonenca, with the surly owners who are still surly. And here we had their delicious "horchata" (drink made from tiger nuts popular in these parts) as well as some of their home made "turrón" ice cream. With a bit of difficulty we were allowed to take Pippa in.</span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">From here we walked along the familiar streets towards Calle de las Flores, the name of the street where our modest town house was. As always when I walk the streets in Callosa I get goose pimples from nostalgia for my wonderful teenage years here with my family and friends. Calle de las Flores is a modest street and our house was what my Father used to call "holiday accommodation". It was a very simple house but we loved it and spent many happy summers there. I had to have a photo outside sitting on the street as I used to do in my teens. This is it, 45 years later!</span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">A particularly lovely old haunt I wanted to show my friends was the old wash house where, before the days of washing machines, the local women used to do their laundry. It was built in the early 19th century and no doubt was modern for its times. I remember going there singing with my friends, Russian songs my Aunt had taught us to sing in harmony and it was marvelous because of the great acoustics. </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">The next stop on Friday's itinerary was further up the mountains to the picturesque village of "Castell de Guadalest", literally a castle and village perched high up on a mountain. Unbelievably, while walking past a bar in the village, a man sitting there spoke to me in the local dialect, "valenciano". I replied in Spanish that I didn't speak the dialect well and he answered that oh yes I did and that he knew me from Bolulla. I was bowled over that someone from Bolulla who I didn't recall remembered me from 45 years ago. His name was Joaquín Andrés and he is my age so would have been a teenager like me at the time. Wow I was astonished; bowled over really. I got Eladio to take a photo to remember the moment.</span><br></br>

This is a popular place for swimming in the natural pools formed by the river Algar. It is also full of restaurants, stalls, etc and was a place we went a lot to in our Callosa years.

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We rested after lunch by the pool which brought back many memories. Eladio had a long siesta on a sunbed and the 3 of us sat on chairs enjoying the rest and time together. Only Kathy and I went in. The water was quite cold but nothing like the river water we would experience later.</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">At about 6, when we thought there would be fewer people, we made our way up the  path to the waterfalls. Someone told us dogs were not allowed in high season. I couldn't believe it as we have been here with Pippa before. Besides, where we would leave her? So we smuggled her in covered in a towel which was quite hilarious. Only one person later told us dogs weren't allowed and we pleaded ignorance. Spain is such a non dog friendly country. Soon they wont' be allowed out of their houses for xxx sake. </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Here we bathed in the main waterfall or rather by it as it is far to strong to go under although we always used to when we were younger. It's such fun climbing over the rocks and trying to swim towards it when the current is against you.</span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Soon it was late, around 8 pm and we left all saying what a wonderful day we had had and what a wonderful swim in the river and natural pools. The last destination of our very full and long day tour was to my beloved Bolulla, the little village some 2km up the mountains from Algar. People still remember me there and it's just so nostalgic to be there. I saw my Aunt's old house which I was told had been sold for just 20.000 euros. That's not much but then you see she bought it for about 500 pounds at the time. I showed my friends the main streets, including the lovely flowered one where old women usually sit out at night and chat in the local dialect.</span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We got a table for dinner at the only bar in the vilalge, "L'Era" which is a modest little setup with the most divine food, simple but beautifully cooked and with friendly owners. There were lots of other "foreign" diners there which surprised me. I knew there were English owners in the village after my Aunt started to spread the word in Norwich where she taught a the University of East Anglia. But that night there were Belgians on the table next to us who told us they were staying at an Airbnb! I could hardly believe there would be Airbnb in the village but times have moved on. </span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We loved every morsel we ate under the moonlit sky in "my village" and our friends did too. We had what they called a round of tapas, just stuff they had prepared in the kitchen and which was served very promptly. We washed it all down with 2 jugs of sangria. The bill was just 48 euros for the 4 of us!!!</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">It was dark and late when we finished and we had to make a move as our apartment is at least 1.5 h away. Our hero, Eladio the driver, drove us safely back and we were home by just after midnight. We all agreed a good day was had by all. </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Saturday came and the plan for the day was to go to the beach in the morning, early again, to avoid the crowds as the beach here in July and August gets very full, especially at the weekends. We were down on the "Playa de Arenales" by about 9.45 and it was still early enough to secure a front row position by the sea. The water was clean and pleasant as always as this beach is a well kept one. We took our books and read in the shade and later walked to the end towards the cliffs above which are apartment block is situated. I love that part of the beach as it is a natural one with no buildings, just  dunes.</span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">We stayed until about 13 h when it was already getting far too hot and as other people were coming down, we left. Eladio and Phil went to get more water from the British shop, Quicksave- we go through gallons of it here - and Kathy and I made our way to the swimming pool to shower and swim and get rid of the sand from our bodies. Lunch was simple, fillet steak and salad followed by the most delicious water melon. August and September used to be the season for melons, water melons, grapes and greengages here in Spain so in theory it's the best time to buy them, although there no longer seem to be seasons for fruit as everything is grown all year round these days. But I like to think they taste better now .I well remember in our Callosa years discovering in August the sweetest melons I had ever eaten. </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">While Eladio and I slept a well needed siesta after so much sun, our friends went out to explore the shops in the 4 pm sun! We would never dare out at that time of day in this heat. They did come home a bit bothered and looking very hot and in need of a siesta too. </span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">Yesterday I had programmed in a walk to the light house cliffs - the Cape of Santa Pola - for our friends to see the view at sunset. It never disappoints and despite the crowds of people (I have never seen so many there), the walk was lovely. We went at 8 pm to avoid the heat. And here is my usual photo with Pips at the end of the cape.</span><br></br>

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , sans-serif;">The sun sets on the other side of the cliffs so there was not much to see of it but we were rewarded on our way back with the moon rise and the amazing shimmer it makes on sea water. Eladio told us the word for it in Spanish was "riela", a new word for both Phil and me. This is the best I could get out of my camera because the moon was much bigger than it appears in the photo.</span><br></br>

Our friends will be leaving on Monday and we shall go on Tuesday. On the bright side Oli is coming today from Valencia and I can't wait to see her. We shall be going to the beach again today and showing Alicante to our friends tonight. It's very near and they have to see the Explanada at least before they go. The Explanada is a similar walkway to the Ramblas in Barcelona and I have always loved it. No doubt we shall have dinner at the port. But you will hear all about it in next week's post.</span><br></br>
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><br></br></span>
<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">You will have noticed there is no mention of any news this week apart from the earthquakes in Lombok. That is because I have been on a sort of news free holiday, simply because we have been so active.Or maybe I am detoxing from it. But not to worry, next week we will be home and I shall be following the news closely as usual.</span><br></br>
